# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation

## 1. Extension Overview
- **Name**: LBG : BLR : Set : Merge Data Layer with CLOVA3
- **ID**: 100036
- **Type**: Javascript Code
- **Scope**: Before Load Rules
- **Execution Frequency**: Run Always

**Summary**:  
This extension merges the `window.clova3.datalayer` object into the `eventPayload` object. By iterating over the keys in the existing data layer, it assigns those that are not already present in the payload. The purpose of this extension is to enrich event data with additional context from the CLOVA3 data layer, thereby enhancing analytics capabilities.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- `datalayer`: Represents the data obtained from `window.clova3.datalayer.get()`.
- `pl`: An object to hold the current event payload data excluding any cookie-related keys.
- `plb`: A boolean flag to control whether to copy keys into `pl`.
- `debug_event`: An object capturing debug information about the current analytics event.

### Logic Flow
1. The data layer is fetched from `window.clova3.datalayer`.
2. The analytics event count is incremented.
3. The current state of the event payload is processed, and keys that start with "cp." are excluded from the payload.
4. Debug information is created and logged into `window.analytics_event_log`.
5. The `datalayer` keys are merged into `eventPayload` if they aren't already present.
6. If certain conditions are met, a new object `Q` is created that supports various string processing functions relevant to the journey analytics.
7. The `Q` object can register a handler for incoming data, enabling additional mapping of fields.

### Dependencies
This code depends on the following global objects and libraries:
- `window.clova3`: For accessing the data layer.
- `window.LBGAnalytics`: For any custom analytics.
- `utag`: For managing Tealium's internal event mappings.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Conditions
When an event is triggered:
- The data layer from `window.clova3.datalayer` is fetched.
- The event payload is enriched with any non-duplicate keys from the data layer.
- Debugging information is logged, which can be useful in troubleshooting.

### Edge Conditions
- If `window.LBGAnalytics` or `window.clova3` is not defined, the extension won’t merge any additional information which can lead to incomplete data in the event payload.
- If the number of keys in the data layer is exceedingly large, it may cause performance issues during the merge operation.

### Sample Scenario
1. An event named `pageView` triggers the extension.
2. The data layer contains `{"userId": "123", "page": "home"}`.
3. If `eventPayload` already contains `{"userId": "456"}`, the final `eventPayload` after merging will be `{"userId": "456", "page": "home"}`.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas
- There is no error handling for situations where `window.clova3.datalayer.get()` fails or returns unexpected results.
- No checks for duplicate keys in the `datalayer` versus the `eventPayload`, which could lead to confusing data if different contexts are merged.
- Special attention should be paid to cookie-related keys; if encountered, they cause the merging process to stop for the remaining keys in the payload.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring
- **Defensive Checks**: Implement checks for the existence of `window.clova3` and its methods before accessing them to avoid runtime errors.
- **Code Style**: Maintain consistent use of indentation and spacing for better readability.
- **Modularization**: Break down large sections into smaller helper functions. For instance, you may abstract the debug event creation and key merging into separate functions.
- **Logging**: Consider adding more informative logs in case of unsuccessful operations to ease debugging.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes
- Regularly review and update the extension as related libraries or APIs change.
- Assign ownership of this extension to ensure it’s tested and updated as needed.
- Create a test suite to cover different scenarios, including edge cases, to maintain robustness in future updates.

### Testing Guidelines
- Use unit tests to verify the functionality of individual components.
- Conduct integration tests to ensure compatibility with other extensions and external scripts.
- Regularly review logs generated by the extension to identify any anomalies or issues. 

By following this structured documentation, developers and stakeholders will have a thorough understanding of the extension, its functionality, and how to maintain it effectively.
