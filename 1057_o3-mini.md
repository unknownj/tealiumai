# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive overview and analysis of the Tealium iQ extension "GWC : Tag : Set : Phone Conversion Number". The following sections cover an extension overview, detailed code explanation, usage examples, known limitations, recommendations for refactoring, and maintenance guidelines.

---

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** GWC : Tag : Set : Phone Conversion Number  
- **ID:** 1057 (Extension ID: 100036)  
- **Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** 879  
- **Execution Frequency:** Executed every time the associated tag is triggered

**Summary:**  
This Tealium iQ extension is designed to configure a Google Ads conversion tag (AW-807971864) by setting a specific phone conversion number (`0345 608 0374`). It utilises the global `gtag` function to pass configuration parameters to the underlying Google Ads conversion tracking. The extension is intended for marketing purposes, ensuring accurate phone conversion data is sent to Google Ads when a relevant event is triggered.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Code Structure
The code structure is wrapped in an immediately-invoked function expression (IIFE) to create a local scope and avoid polluting the global namespace. Here is a breakdown of the key components:

```javascript
(function(a, b, u){
  gtag('config', 'AW-807971864/dUE3CMLrooIBEJjYooED', {
      'phone_conversion_number': '0345 608 0374'
  });
})(eventType, eventPayload, tagObject);
```

### Key Variables & Parameters
- **a, b, u:**  
  These parameters represent `eventType`, `eventPayload`, and `tagObject` respectively. They are passed into the function to maintain consistent availability of data through the extension's execution. Their specific roles are as follows:
  - **eventType (a):** A string indicating the type of event triggering the code.
  - **eventPayload (b):** An object containing data related to the event.
  - **tagObject (u):** An object representing the tag configuration or context.

### Logic Flow
1. **IIFE Execution:**  
   The function receives three guaranteed parameters from Tealium iQ: `eventType`, `eventPayload`, and `tagObject`.

2. **Function Call to gtag:**  
   Inside the IIFE, the global `gtag` function is called with:
   - **First Argument ('config'):** Specifies the action to configure the tag.
   - **Second Argument ('AW-807971864/dUE3CMLrooIBEJjYooED'):** The unique identifier for the Google Ads conversion tag.
   - **Third Argument (Configuration Object):** An object containing the key-value pair where `'phone_conversion_number'` is set to the string `0345 608 0374`.

### Dependencies
- **Global gtag Function:**  
  The extension depends on the global `gtag` function, which is a part of the Google Analytics/Ads libraries and must be loaded before this extension is executed.  
- **Tealium Guarantee:**  
  `eventType` and `eventPayload` are guaranteed to be present in the context where the extension is executed, as per Tealium iQ standards.

---

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Operation
- **Scenario:**  
  A user event triggers the conversion tag.  
- **Data Flow:**  
  The `eventType` (for example, "click" or "page_view") and corresponding `eventPayload` are passed into the IIFE together with `tagObject`. The extension then configures the Google Ads conversion tag with the provided phone conversion number.
- **Outcome:**  
  The Google Ads conversion tracking is initialised with phone conversion data to accurately track the conversion actions associated with phone calls.

### Edge Conditions
- **Missing or Improperly Configured Global gtag:**  
  - **Scenario:**  
    Should the global `gtag` function not be loaded properly or is missing, the code will fail silently in terms of setting the configuration.
  - **Handling:**  
    Since defensive coding for `eventType` and `eventPayload` is not required by project specifications (as they are guaranteed), monitoring the presence of `gtag` is recommended externally (e.g. via a loading check).

- **Overlapping Tag Configurations:**  
  - **Scenario:**  
    If multiple extensions or scripts attempt to configure the same Google Ads tag, there could be conflicts or unexpected behaviour.
  - **Handling:**  
    Care should be taken to review and coordinate tag configurations across the platform to avoid duplications or race conditions.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Global Dependency:**  
  The code depends entirely on the global `gtag` function. Any interference, modifications, or delays in the loading of the gtag library might result in the extension not working as expected.

- **Non-conditional Execution:**  
  The extension executes its code unconditionally since there are no conditions included. This means that every event triggering this extension will attempt to run the configuration without filtering based on event properties.

- **Potential Conflicts:**  
  - Other Tealium iQ extensions that modify Google Ads configuration might conflict if they configure the same conversion tag identifier.
  - External scripts that overwrite or modify the global `gtag` function can lead to errors or unexpected behaviour.

- **Hardcoding Values:**  
  The phone conversion number is hardcoded. Changing it requires modifying the code directly, which might affect maintainability if the number needs frequent updates.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

### Code Improvements
- **Defensive Check for gtag:**  
  Although not required to check for `eventType` or `eventPayload`, consider adding a defensive check for the existence of the global `gtag` function to ensure robustness:  
  (Note: Implement this check in a manner compliant with ES5.)

  Example:

  function safeGtagCall(configID, conversionNumber) {
      if (typeof gtag === 'function') {
          gtag('config', configID, {'phone_conversion_number': conversionNumber});
      } else {
          // Optionally log or handle the error gracefully
      }
  }
  
  (function(a, b, u){
      safeGtagCall('AW-807971864/dUE3CMLrooIBEJjYooED', '0345 608 0374');
  })(eventType, eventPayload, tagObject);

- **Configuration Externalisation:**  
  Extract configuration values such as the tag identifier and phone conversion number into external settings or Tealium data layer variables. This enhances maintainability by avoiding hardcoding.

- **Documentation Comments:**  
  Include inline comments within the code for improved clarity, detailing each step and purpose of the function.

### Best Practices
- Keep the code modular and clearly separated from other tag configuration logic.
- Ensure that any shared dependencies (like the gtag library) are examined for potential overlaps with other extensions.
- Maintain a clear version control history with detailed commit messages to track changes in configurations.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

### Ongoing Maintenance
- **Version Control:**  
  Maintain the extension code under version control (e.g., Git) and ensure that any changes or updates are tracked with descriptive commit messages.
  
- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  Establish testing procedures to verify that the Google Ads conversion tag is correctly configured after changes. This might include:
  - Unit tests or integration tests verifying the output of the configuration call.
  - Regular monitoring using Tealium’s preview mode and browser developer tools.

- **Ownership and Documentation:**  
  Assign specific team members or roles for maintaining this extension and ensure that documentation is updated concurrently with any code modifications.
  
- **Monitoring Dependencies:**  
  Monitor the global `gtag` library updates and Google Ads conversion tag requirements from Google to ensure compatibility with new versions or changes in API.

- **Change Management:**  
  When any business changes occur (such as a change in the conversion phone number or tag ID), update both the extension code and its documentation simultaneously.
