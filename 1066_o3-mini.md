# Fire Tag Once Extension Documentation

This document provides an in-depth look at the "Fire Tag Once" extension, including an overview, a detailed explanation of its code, examples of its usage, known limitations and gotchas, recommendations for refactoring, and maintenance notes.

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Fire Tag Once  
- **ID:** 1066  
- **Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** 893, 1214, 995  
- **Execution Frequency:** Runs on each invocation unless the internal flag indicates it has already fired

**Summary:**  
The "Fire Tag Once" extension is designed to ensure that a particular tag (or piece of code) is executed only once during the page or session lifecycle. It achieves this by utilising a flag (u.loaded) that is set after the first execution. On subsequent invocations, the extension checks this flag and exits immediately if the tag has already been loaded. This is particularly useful in preventing duplicate tag firings that could lead to analytics duplication or unexpected behaviour.

---

## 2. Code Explanation

The core functionality of the extension is encapsulated in an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE):

### Key Variables
- **a / eventType:** Represents the event type passed into the extension.  
- **b / eventPayload:** The event payload object which may contain additional data for processing.  
- **u / tagObject:** The tag object. This object holds a property (`loaded`) which acts as a flag to check if the tag has already been fired.

### Logic Flow
1. **Initial Check:**  
   The function begins by checking if `u.loaded` is set to `true`.  
   - If `u.loaded === true`, the function immediately returns false, thereby halting further execution. This prevents the tag from being fired again.

2. **Setting the Flag:**  
   - If the `loaded` flag is not set, the code sets `u.loaded` to `true`. This ensures that the tag's firing is marked and subsequent calls will not execute the tag logic again.

### Dependencies
- The extension relies on the presence of global objects/variables (`eventType`, `eventPayload`, and `tagObject`).  
- It assumes the tagObject has a property named `loaded` that can be checked and modified. No additional libraries are required.

The overall structure ensures that the tag (or code associated with the tag) will run only once per page load or session, depending on how the tagObject manages its persistence.

---

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Scenario
- **Initial Execution:**  
  - When a page loads, the extension is triggered.  
  - Since `u.loaded` is not set, the code sets `u.loaded` to `true` and executes the tag logic.
  
- **Subsequent Execution:**  
  - If the same event triggers the extension again (e.g. via another page interaction or repeated events), the check finds that `u.loaded` is already `true`, and the function exits without re-executing the tag logic.

### Edge Conditions
- **If the Tag Object is Reused Incorrectly:**  
  - If for some reason the tagObject is re-instantiated or not preserved, the flag might be reset, potentially allowing the tag to fire more than once.  
  - In a well-managed environment, the tagObject should persist to maintain the state.

- **Interference by External Scripts:**  
  - If another external script accidentally manipulates the `loaded` flag on the tagObject, it could stop the tag from firing.  
  - Developers must ensure that the `loaded` property is reserved for this purpose and not overridden by any other code segment.

---

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Reliance on Tag Object Integrity:**  
  - The extension depends on the tagObject to consistently maintain the `loaded` flag. If other scripts modify the tagObject unexpectedly, it could lead to missed or duplicate tag firings.

- **Single Flag Usage:**  
  - The simple flag mechanism (`u.loaded`) does not allow for multiple distinct events or scenarios where different parts of the same tag logic may need to run separately. It’s an all-or-nothing approach.

- **Potential Conflicts:**  
  - If multiple extensions or scripts attempt to use a similar flag on the same tagObject, there is a risk of conflict. Coordination between all team members deploying extensions is required.

- **Debugging Difficulty:**  
  - As the code returns early if the flag is set, it may complicate debugging, particularly when trying to understand why the tag isn’t executing in follow-on requests.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks:**  
  - Although eventType and eventPayload are guaranteed, consider verifying the presence of `u` (tagObject) before accessing the `loaded` property.  
  - Example:  
    if (!u || typeof u.loaded === 'undefined') { /* handle accordingly */ }

- **Code Style Enhancements in ES5:**  
  - Maintain a consistent code style. For example, ensure all comparisons use strict equality (===) as done in the current code.
  - Add comments within the code to further clarify steps, especially if future developers need exhaustive detail.

- **Modularisation:**  
  - If this logic is used in multiple places, consider moving the check and flag-setting mechanism into a reusable function.  
  - Example:  
    function fireTagOnce(tagObject) {  
      if (tagObject.loaded === true) return false;  
      tagObject.loaded = true;  
      return true;  
    }  
    This would enhance readability and potentially aid in debugging and future updates.

- **Side-Effect Documentation:**  
  - Clearly document that the function has the side-effect of setting a property on the tagObject. Other developers should be aware that this property change is vital for the firing mechanism.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  - Ensure that any update to related global objects (like tagObject structure) does not conflict with the `loaded` flag.  
  - Keep a version history or changelog for the extension so changes in behaviour or new dependencies can be tracked.

- **Ownership:**  
  - Assign a team member or a dedicated group responsible for the maintenance of tag-related extensions in Tealium iQ.  
  - Include regular code reviews to check for any unforeseen side-effects or conflicts with other extensions.

- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Unit tests should simulate multiple invocations of the extension to confirm that the tag fires only once.  
  - Integrate tests that verify the proper handling of the tagObject and ensure no unintended modifications occur.  
  - Establish a staging environment where modifications to tag logic can be validated thoroughly before deployment to production.

- **Future Enhancements:**  
  - Evaluate if additional flags (or timers) might be beneficial in tracking multiple interactions or delayed operations.  
  - Consider abstracting tag firing logic for use across multiple tags if consistent behaviour is required.
