# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name**: OVA : TAG : Set : Event Listeners
- **ID**: 1070
- **Type**: Javascript Code
- **Scope**: 893
- **Execution Frequency**: Active

### Summary
This extension sets up event listeners for a virtual assistant interface on a webpage, enabling user interactions with the assistant. It captures various events such as clicks on the trigger to open the assistant, submitting user input, and clicking on FAQ items. This data is sent as link events to Tealium for further tracking and analysis.

---

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- **`c$`**: A reference to the jQuery object (a common practice to avoid conflicts with other libraries).
- **`cvdiv`**: A DOM element created to serve as the container for the Virtual Assistant interface.
- **`VAMD`**: An object encapsulating all functionality related to loading and interacting with the virtual assistant.

### Logic Flow
1. **Container Creation**: A `DIV` element is created and added to the body to host the virtual assistant interface.
2. **Event Handlers**: Various click event handlers are established:
   - Clicking on the trigger div opens the assistant and logs a journey event.
   - Submitting input captures the text entered by the user and logs another event.
   - Clicking on FAQ items logs which FAQ was interacted with.
3. **Loading the Assistant**: The assistant is loaded, and various initialisation procedures are executed, including requesting external resources and listening for user interactions.
4. **Event Listeners**: Includes listeners for clicks, key presses, and specific user interactions with elements of the assistant.

### Dependencies
- **Global Objects**: Requires `window.utag` for tracking events.
- **Libraries**: Utilises jQuery (referenced through `c$`) for DOM manipulation.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Scenarios
1. **User Opens the Assistant**:
   - User clicks the `.va-trigger` div.
   - The extension logs a `JourneyName` as "VirtualAssistant" with step 1 indicating "Overlay".

2. **User Submits a Query**:
   - User types in the assistant input (`input.va-inp-txt`) and clicks the `Submit` button.
   - Captured input value is sent as an `EventValue` in the journey log for analysis.

3. **User Clicks on FAQ**:
   - User selects a link from the FAQ section.
   - The text of the clicked question is logged as the `EventNarrative`.

### Edge Conditions
- **Rapid Clicking on Trigger**:
   - If the trigger is clicked multiple times, the assistant may send multiple overlay events but is handled as designed.
- **Empty Input Submission**:
   - If the user submits an empty entry, the system will still capture it but may require handling at the destination for null or empty values.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Browser Compatibility**: The code specifically checks for Internet Explorer, meaning incompatibilities with modern browsers may need additional testing.
- **Dependency on jQuery**: If jQuery is not available on the page or is conflicting with another version, unexpected behaviours may occur.
- **Event Overlap**: Multiple event listeners on similar elements can result in redundant data being sent to Tealium.
- **Resource Loading Issues**: If the external resources fail to load, the assistant may not function correctly.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

### Suggested Improvements
- **Modularisation**: Consider breaking the code into smaller, reusable modules that handle specific tasks (e.g., event handling, DOM manipulation).
- **Defensive Programming**: For instance, confirm that required elements exist before adding event listeners to prevent silent failures.
- **Code Style Consistency**: Ensure consistent formatting and naming conventions to improve readability.
- **Commenting**: Maintain consistent commenting to describe complex logic or specific operations.
  
### Note
Be mindful to stick with ES5 standards and avoid ES6 features.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

1. **Ongoing Maintenance**: Regularly review and test for compatibility with new browser versions and libraries.
2. **Ownership**: Assign a dedicated team or individual to oversee updates and changes in functionality, ensuring a point of contact for issues.
3. **Testing Guidelines**: Regularly conduct testing in multiple environments to ensure compatibility, especially after changes or updates to the codebase.
4. **Documentation Updates**: Keep this documentation up-to-date with any changes made to the extension.

This structured documentation aims to provide clarity and ensure consistent development practices across the team.
