# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name**: OVA : TAG : Set : Event Listeners
- **ID**: 1070
- **Type**: Javascript Code
- **Scope**: 893
- **Execution Frequency**: Active

### Summary
This extension is designed to manage a Virtual Assistant (VA) interface on a webpage. It achieves this by creating event listeners that track user interactions with the VA, including clicks on a trigger button, submission of queries through the assistant, and clicks on Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) links. The data captured through these interactions is sent to Tealium's Universal Tag (Utag) for further processing and analytics, helping improve user engagement and experience with the virtual assistant.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- `c$`: A reference to jQuery (or similar) through the global `clova2` object.
- `cvdiv`: A newly created `DIV` element for the VA interface.
- `VAMD`: An IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) that encapsulates the main functionality of the VA.

### Logic Flow
1. **Container Creation**: The `createCVContainer()` function initializes the VA container by creating a `DIV` element and appending it to the body of the document.
2. **Event Handlers**: The `createCVEventHandlers()` function registers click event listeners:
   - On `div.va-trigger`: Sends a link event when the VA is triggered.
   - On `input.va-inp-btn[value=Submit]`: Captures the user's query and sends it as a link event.
   - On FAQ links: Captures clicks on FAQs and sends link events with the corresponding text.
3. **Load Virtual Assistant**: The `loadCV()` function initializes the VA logic, setting up various configuration options and potentially loading external scripts and stylesheets.
4. **Interactive Behaviour**: The code features dynamic elements such as autocomplete suggestions and user surveys, along with fallback mechanisms when errors occur.

### Dependencies
- **jQuery**: Utilised throughout the extension, particularly for event handling and DOM manipulation.
- `window.clova3`: The extension makes multiple references to this object, which likely contains logging and utility functions related to the Virtual Assistant's functionality.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Conditions
- When a user clicks on the "Ask us" button (`div.va-trigger`), a `utag.link` event is sent with the `JourneyName`, `JourneyStep`, and `JourneyEvent` details.
- Upon submitting a query through the input field (when the "Submit" button is clicked), the input value is sent as part of the generated event payload, enhancing the data captured for analytics.

### Edge Conditions
- If the autocomplete feature fails to load or an AJAX request to fetch suggestions results in an error, relevant warnings are logged to the console, although functionality may degrade without impacting the core user experience.
- If a user tries to trigger the VA while it's already open, the interface gracefully handles the interaction without any visual glitches or errors, toggling its visibility.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Browser Compatibility**: The extension checks for non-IE browsers before executing the main functionality, meaning it may not operate as intended in Internet Explorer.
- **Dependency on jQuery**: If `jQuery` is not available globally, the extension will not function correctly, as it heavily relies on jQuery for handling events and DOM manipulation.
- **Session Storage Availability**: Access to session storage is assumed; if not available, data persistence may fail.
- **Potential Conflicts**: If other extensions modify the same elements or attach conflicting event listeners, unexpected behavior may occur.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Modularisation**: Split the large IIFE into smaller, reusable functions to enhance readability and testability.
- **Error Handling**: Introduce more robust error handling particularly around AJAX requests. For example, checking the response status before proceeding.
- **Code Style**: Clearer separation of functions and consistent naming conventions would enhance maintainability. Consider using single-letter variable names only when in a very confined scope.
- **Defensive Checks**: Use defensive checks to validate the presence of elements or attributes before manipulating them. Although eventType and eventPayload are guaranteed, other assumptions may lead to errors.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance**: Ensure regular updates in line with changes to the VA backend or Tealium's API advancements. Maintain a versioning system for the extension code.
- **Ownership**: Assign a dedicated team or individual to oversee the functionality and performance of the extension, with responsibilities to test updates regularly.
- **Testing Guidelines**: Incorporate automated tests where possible to cover core functionalities, especially after updates. Manual testing should also be included in the process for user experience verification.
