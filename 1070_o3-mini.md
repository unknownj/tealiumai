# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation

This document describes the "OVA : TAG : Set : Event Listeners" extension for Tealium iQ. The following sections outline an overview, code explanation, usage examples, known limitations, recommendations for refactoring, and maintenance notes.

---

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** OVA : TAG : Set : Event Listeners  
- **Extension ID:** 1070 (with extension reference ID 100036)  
- **Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** 893  
- **Execution Frequency:**  
  - Runs on page load once the window load event fires  
  - If the page load has already completed (based on performance timing), it initialises immediately.  

**Summary:**  
This extension sets up event listeners and initialises a Virtual Assistant (VA) interface on a page. It creates a container DIV for the VA, binds click event handlers for various UI elements (such as trigger buttons, submit buttons and FAQ links) and loads the VA functionality via a resource loader. The design is to track user interactions (using Tealium's utag.link calls) and to provide an advanced interactive Virtual Assistant experience via dynamic script and stylesheet insertion. The extension also supports features such as autocomplete, survey forms and internal survey feedback through integrated event handlers.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables and Functions

- **Global Dependencies:**
  - `window.clova2.$`: A reference to the jQuery library (or jQuery-like instance) used throughout the extension.
  - `window.clova3.log`: A logging function for debugging purposes.
  - `window.utag.link`: Tealiumâ€™s method to send tracking events.
  - Global objects for the Virtual Assistant such as `va` and a self-contained `VAMD` object.

- **Primary Functions:**
  - **createCVContainer():**  
    - Creates a DIV with the ID `virtual-assistant` which serves as the container for the Virtual Assistant interface.
    - Appends the container into the document body.
    - Logs the action using `window.clova3.log`.

  - **createCVEventHandlers():**  
    - Binds multiple click events using the jQuery alias (`c$`):
      - A click on any element matching `div.va-trigger` sends a tracking event indicating the start of the Virtual Assistant overlay.
      - A click on an input with class `va-inp-btn` (and value "Submit") triggers a tracking event capturing the search text input.
      - A click on FAQ list items (selectors like `.va-faq-ul li a, .va-faqs li a`) sends a tracking event capturing the FAQ link text.
      
  - **loadCV():**  
    - Initialises the Virtual Assistant by defining helper functions (`ask_question` and `bot_nav`) on the `window` object.
    - Defines and sets up the `VAMD` object that encapsulates VA configuration, dynamic script and CSS loading (via the `n` function), event binding for VA UI actions, and integration with autocomplete and ICS (in-call survey) features.
    - Supports loading additional resources such as jQuery (if not already present) and other required scripts and stylesheets, appending them to the VA container.
    - Uses a resource loader function `s()` to sequentially load the scripts.
    - Binds events to the VA container for toggling the interface, closing the interface, and handling other mouse/keyboard interactions.
    
- **Resource Loading and Event Binding:**
  - The extension dynamically constructs the VA interface HTML and appends it to the container.
  - Uses a debug flag in configuration (`a.conf.debug`) for detailed logging.
  - Handles asynchronous script loading and initialisation via callbacks.
  - Binds keyboard events for input field autocomplete navigation along with mouse events for closing modal windows and survey forms.

- **Execution Path:**
  - The code first checks for complete page load using `window.performance.timing.loadEventEnd`.  
    - If the page has loaded, `VAMD.init()` is called.  
    - Otherwise, the extension binds the `load` event on the window (with appropriate fallback for attachEvent in older environments).
  - Finally, a condition ignoring Internet Explorer (based on user agent detection `"MSIE"`) is used to run the set up functions: `createCVEventHandlers()`, `createCVContainer()`, and `loadCV()`.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Example 1: Standard User Interaction

1. **Page Load and Initialisation:**
   - When the page is loaded, the extension creates a DIV with the ID `virtual-assistant` and initialises the Virtual Assistant interface.
   - The VA scripts and stylesheets are dynamically loaded from the remote URI.

2. **Triggering the Virtual Assistant:**
   - A user clicks on the element with class `va-trigger`.
   - The `createCVEventHandlers()` function captures this click and sends a tracking event using `window.utag.link` indicating that the Virtual Assistant overlay has been expanded (with parameters: JourneyName "VirtualAssistant", JourneyStep 1, JourneyEvent "Overlay").

3. **Submitting a Query to the Virtual Assistant:**
   - The user types a question in the input field (class `va-inp-txt`) and then clicks the submit button (class `va-inp-btn` with value "Submit").
   - The event handler sends a tracking event capturing the entered text (parameters include JourneyName "VirtualAssistant", JourneyStep 2, JourneyEvent "Field Update", EventValue with the text value).

4. **Interacting with FAQ Links:**
   - When a user clicks on an FAQ item (links contained in `.va-faq-ul li a` or `.va-faqs li a`), an event handler captures the text of the clicked element and sends a tracking event (parameters include JourneyName "VirtualAssistant", JourneyStep 3, JourneyEvent "Internal Link").

### Example 2: Edge Conditions

- **Delayed Page Load:**  
  If the page load event is delayed (or the performance timing is not yet set), the extension attaches to the window load event handler to ensure proper initialisation.
  
- **Survey Interaction:**  
  - The Virtual Assistant may prompt a survey after certain interaction flows.  
  - If the user fails to provide survey input or cancels the survey, fallback logic is executed (e.g. closing the survey modal and sending a cancellation tracking event).
  
- **Autocomplete Behaviour:**  
  - As the user types into the VA input field, an autocomplete request is triggered if the text length exceeds two characters.  
  - If no suggestions are returned or the user presses the escape key (code 27), the autocomplete list is removed from the UI.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **External Dependencies:**
  - The extension relies on remote resources (scripts and CSS from a specified `resourceURI`). Connection issues or misconfigured URIs may lead to failure in loading the Virtual Assistant functionality.
  - The extension depends on global objects such as `window.clova2.$` and `window.clova3.log`. If these are overridden or not available at runtime, issues may occur.
  - The `window.utag.link` function must be available for tracking events; otherwise, tracking calls will fail.

- **Browser Compatibility:**
  - A specific check is performed against the Internet Explorer user agent string (`"MSIE"`). This could potentially misidentify some browsers or future versions.

- **Script Load Sequencing:**
  - The dynamic script loading mechanism uses sequential callbacks. If any script fails to load or takes too long, subsequent initialisation may be affected.
  
- **Potential Conflict Areas:**
  - If other Tealium extensions or external scripts use the same selectors (for instance, elements with the same CSS classes) there is a risk of event handling conflicts.
  - The extension attaches handlers to the document body and specific elements. Overlapping or duplicate event handlers defined elsewhere may lead to unexpected behaviour.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Modularisation and Organisation:**
  - Consider organising the code into smaller modules or functions that encapsulate specific functionality (e.g. one module for event binding, another for dynamic resource loading).
  - Separate configuration data (such as resource URIs, script lists and VA settings) into a dedicated configuration object to simplify updates.

- **Defensive Coding and Error Handling:**
  - Although defensive checks for `eventType` and `eventPayload` are not necessary, additional error handling around asynchronous script loading would improve reliability.
  - Introducing try-catch blocks within asynchronous callbacks can prevent unhandled exceptions from stopping VA initialisation.

- **Code Style Improvements (ES5 Compliance):**
  - Continue to adhere to ES5 standards by avoiding ES6 features (arrow functions, let/const, template literals).
  - Increase inline commenting to describe non-obvious logic and to aid other developers in understanding the flow.
  - Break down large functions (such as the one handling the VA engine and event binding) into smaller helper functions for improved testability and maintenance.

- **Potential Optimisations:**
  - Investigate caching strategies for remote resources to improve load times.
  - Consolidate repeated code patterns (e.g., similar utag.link calls) into reusable helper methods.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ownership and Version Control:**
  - Establish versioning of the extension and document any update cycles.
  - Identify a point of contact or a team responsible for ongoing support and monitoring of the integration.

- **Testing Guidelines:**
  - Perform regular regression testing to ensure that updates to external resources (remote scripts and CSS) do not break functionality.
  - Test under varying network conditions to simulate delays or failures in external resource loading.
  - Ensure that browser compatibility tests include older browsers as well as modern ones (keeping in mind the ES5 requirement).

- **Logging and Monitoring:**
  - Leverage the existing logging via `window.clova3.log` to diagnose issues in production.
  - Consider implementing enhanced error reporting or alerts if critical failures occur during the initialisation or tracking events.

- **Documentation and Code Comments:**
  - Continue to update inline documentation as the code evolves.
  - Keep the external documentation in sync with internal code comments to prevent discrepancies in understanding the VA integration lifecycle.
