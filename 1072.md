# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation

## 1. Extension Overview
- **Name**: WTA : TAG : Set : Q&A with Event Value & Narrative
- **ID**: 1072
- **Type**: Javascript Code
- **Scope**: 894
- **Execution Frequency**: Active

### Summary
This Tealium iQ extension is designed to process event data related to question-answer pairs by capturing `EventValue` and `EventNarrative`. It detects sensitive information in questions, ensuring that responses are handled appropriately for privacy concerns. The extension effectively mirrors the event data into `QAQuestion` and `QAAnswer`, while implementing safeguards against unintentional data leaks.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- **`a`**: Represents the event type (e.g., a specific interaction).
- **`b`**: The object containing event payload data, which includes the `EventValue`, `EventNarrative`, `QAQuestion`, and `QAAnswer`.
- **`u`**: The tag object from Tealium, with intended support for future extensions that may require it.
- **`problematic_questions`**: An array containing specific keywords that indicate questions requiring sensitive handling.

### Logic Flow
1. **Initial Check**: The code checks whether `EventValue` and `EventNarrative` are present and defined. If they are valid, it proceeds to process them.
2. **Mapping Values**: `QAQuestion` is assigned the value of `EventNarrative` and `QAAnswer` is assigned `EventValue`.
3. **Sensitive Phrase Detection**: The code iterates through the `problematic_questions` array. If any phrase appears in `QAQuestion`, it modifies `QAAnswer` to the string "(Redacted)".

### Dependencies
- The extension relies on the presence of the `eventType` and `eventPayload`, which are guaranteed to be available by the context of usage within Tealium iQ.
- It does not explicitly depend on any external libraries but operates within the Tealium iQ framework.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Condition
- **Input**: 
  - `EventValue`: "42"
  - `EventNarrative`: "What is your favourite number?"
- **Output**:
  - `QAQuestion`: "What is your favourite number?"
  - `QAAnswer`: "42"

### Edge Condition (Sensitive Data Detected)
- **Input**: 
  - `EventValue`: "my_secret_password"
  - `EventNarrative`: "What is your password?"
- **Output**:
  - `QAQuestion`: "What is your password?"
  - `QAAnswer`: "(Redacted)" (due to sensitive information)

---

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas
- The extension only checks for specific sensitive keywords; additional sensitive phrases may need to be manually added to the `problematic_questions` array if encountered.
- It currently does not track or report instances where sensitive questions are asked; this could be an area for future enhancement for compliance and monitoring.
- The extension assumes that `EventValue` and `EventNarrative` are not only defined but also populated meaningfully. No checks against null or falsey values beyond the existing logic are implemented.

---

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring
- **Defensive Checks**: Although `eventType` and `eventPayload` are guaranteed to be present, it would be good practice to validate their content further, ensuring they meet expected data formats or structures.
- **Modularization**: Consider refactoring the sensitive questions check into a separate function to enhance readability and maintainability.
- **Commenting**: While inline comments are useful, more detailed docstring-style comments at the beginning of complex functions may enhance clarity for future developers.
- **Logging**: Implement logging for cases when `(Redacted)` is triggered, which could assist in identifying and reviewing potentially sensitive queries.

---

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes
- **Ownership**: Designate a responsible team member for ongoing maintenance, ensuring timely updates to the list of sensitive keywords as needed.
- **Testing Guidelines**: Establish a series of test cases to validate the extensionâ€™s logic, particularly focusing on both normal operations and edge cases involving sensitive data.
- **Documentation**: Keep this documentation updated when changes are made to the extension to ensure clarity for all stakeholders involved. Utilize version control to track changes over time.
