# Extension Documentation: WTA : TAG : Set : Q&A with Event Value & Narrative

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** WTA : TAG : Set : Q&A with Event Value & Narrative  
- **ID:** 1072  
- **Extension ID:** 100036  
- **Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** 894  
- **Execution Frequency:**  
  - Runs for every event that meets the extension’s conditions (in this case, the code itself checks that relevant data is available within the event payload).  

### Summary

This Tealium iQ extension is designed to process event payloads by checking for the presence of both an EventValue and an EventNarrative. When both fields are provided, the extension assigns them to two new variables (QAQuestion and QAAnswer). Additionally, it applies a safeguard: if the QAQuestion contains any sensitive indicators (such as "password", "username", etc.), the QAAnswer is replaced with the string "(Redacted)". This functionality supports proper data handling – ensuring that sensitive information is not inadvertently passed on to Webtrends or other downstream systems where EventValue might lack mapping.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables

- **a, b, u**: The immediate function passed parameters which are mapped to:
  - `a`: Typically represents the event type (named eventType in the invocation).
  - `b`: Represents the event payload (named eventPayload).
  - `u`: Represents the tag object (named tagObject).

- **b.EventValue & b.EventNarrative**:  
  - Input values from the event payload.
  
- **b.QAQuestion & b.QAAnswer**:  
  - New properties attached to the event payload that act as the processed Q&A pair.

- **problematic_questions**:  
  - An array of strings that represent keywords; if any of these are found in the QAQuestion, then QAAnswer is redacted.

### Logic Flow

1. **Check for Valid Q&A Pair:**
   - The code first checks that `b.EventValue` is not an empty string.
   - It then verifies that `b.EventNarrative` is also not empty and is defined.
     - Note: The logical operator in this check is a combination of the logical AND (`&&`) and bitwise AND (`&`). Although it functions when values are coerced into numbers, care should be taken on its intended use.

2. **Assignment of Q&A Variables:**
   - If both conditions are met:
     - `b.QAQuestion` is set to the value of `b.EventNarrative`.
     - `b.QAAnswer` is set to the value of `b.EventValue`.

3. **Sensitive Data Handling:**
   - The script defines an array (`problematic_questions`) containing keywords that indicate potentially sensitive data (e.g., "password", "passport", "creditcard").
   - It then iterates over each keyword in the array.
   - For each keyword, it converts `b.QAQuestion` to lowercase, removes spaces, and checks if the keyword is present.
   - If a match is found, `b.QAAnswer` is replaced with the string "(Redacted)".

4. **Invoking Environment and Dependency Details:**
   - The code relies on globally defined objects that are supplied (via Tealium iQ) as `eventType` (a string) and `eventPayload` (an object).
   - It also receives a `tagObject` from the integration (although not directly used in this snippet).

## 3. Usage Examples

### Example 1: Standard Q&A Processing

- **Input Event Payload:**
  - EventValue: "42"
  - EventNarrative: "What is the answer to life, the universe, and everything?"
  
- **Processing:**
  - Both values are non-empty, so:
    - QAQuestion becomes "What is the answer to life, the universe, and everything?"
    - QAAnswer is initially set to "42".
  - The QAQuestion does not include any of the keywords such as "password" or "username", so the QAAnswer remains "42".

### Example 2: Sensitive Information Redaction

- **Input Event Payload:**
  - EventValue: "secret123"
  - EventNarrative: "Please enter your password"
  
- **Processing:**
  - Both EventValue and EventNarrative are valid.
  - QAQuestion is set to "Please enter your password".
  - The keyword "password" is present in the QAQuestion when converted to lowercase and stripped of spaces.
  - QAAnswer is therefore replaced with "(Redacted)".

### Example 3: Missing Values

- **Input Event Payload:**
  - EventValue: "" (empty string)
  - EventNarrative: "Some question"
  
- **Processing:**
  - Since EventValue is empty, the condition fails.
  - Neither Q&A variables (QAQuestion or QAAnswer) are assigned or modified.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Logical Operator Usage:**
  - The code uses a mix of the logical AND (`&&`) and a bitwise AND (`&`) in the condition to validate `b.EventNarrative`. This may lead to unintended behaviour if not carefully controlled.  
- **Case Sensitivity and White Space:**
  - Although the keyword check converts QAQuestion to lowercase and removes spaces, there may be edge cases (e.g., punctuation or concatenated sensitive terms) that could bypass detection.  
- **Data Source Integrity:**
  - The extension assumes that the event payload will include the EventValue and EventNarrative fields. If the source of these values is unreliable, unexpected behaviour may occur.
- **Extension Conflicts:**
  - When multiple extensions modify the same payload properties (particularly QAQuestion and QAAnswer), order of execution might affect outcomes. Coordination and careful rule design in Tealium iQ are recommended.
- **Reporting:**
  - The code contains a TODO for building a report to track occurrences of data redaction. As it stands, no logging or reporting mechanism is in place, which could make debugging or monitoring redactions difficult.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Coding Enhancements:**
  - Although the presence of `eventType` and `eventPayload` is guaranteed, consider adding additional checks on the structure of `eventPayload` fields if other integrations or future modifications might change the payload.
  
- **Improving Logical Operator Consistency:**
  - Replace the bitwise operator (`&`) with a logical AND (`&&`) for clarity and to ensure correct boolean logic:
    - For example:  
      if (b.EventValue !== "" && b.EventNarrative !== "" && typeof b.EventNarrative !== "undefined") { … }

- **Modularisation:**
  - Consider extracting the redaction logic into a dedicated function so that it can be tested in isolation and reused if needed.

- **Commenting & Documentation:**
  - Enhance inline comments to further describe the transformation process, particularly around how sensitive data is detected and redacted.
  
- **Reporting Mechanism:**
  - Implement a logging or reporting system for redaction occurrences. This helps in identifying cases which rely on the last line of defence and may need upstream data validation improvements.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**
  - Regularly review the list of sensitive keywords to ensure that it aligns with new security policies or emerging risks.
  - Consider setting up unit tests to simulate different payload scenarios (normal, edge cases, missing fields) to verify that refactoring changes do not break expected behaviour.  

- **Ownership & Testing Guidelines:**
  - Assign maintenance responsibility to the analytics or data security team.
  - Document any changes in a version-controlled repository and conduct code reviews before deployment in Tealium iQ.
  - Create a set of manual and automated tests to verify the payload transformations and ensure that sensitive data is redacted appropriately.
  - Maintain detailed change logs especially when modifying criteria for redaction or event payload handling, to facilitate troubleshooting and future adjustments.

- **Integration Considerations:**
  - Ensure that any changes made in this extension are communicated to other developers who might be extending or integrating with this transformation logic.
  - Monitor the tag firing process after any update to verify that all dependent data downstream (e.g., Webtrends) handles the updated payload correctly.
