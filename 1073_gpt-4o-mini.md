# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation

## 1. Extension Overview
- **Name**: WTA : TAG : Set : Journey Step Name
- **ID**: 100036
- **Type**: Javascript Code
- **Scope**: 894
- **Execution Frequency**: Active

### Summary
This extension is designed to set a name for the journey step in a web analytics framework based on the existing data points of `JourneyStep` and `JourneyAction`. If `JourneyStep` has a value, the extension constructs a `JourneyStepName` string that includes both the step and action, aiding in better tracking and analysis of user journeys. The logic ensures that a journey step name is only set if it's currently absent, thus avoiding overwriting if it is already populated.

## 2. Code Explanation
The core functionality of this extension is encapsulated within an immediately-invoked function expression (IIFE) that takes three parameters: `eventType`, `eventPayload`, and `tagObject`.

### Key Variables
- **a**: Represents `eventType` - a string indicating the type of the event.
- **b**: Represents `eventPayload` - an object containing the data related to the event.
- **u**: Represents `tagObject` - an object used for tagging within Tealium.

### Logic Flow
1. The function first checks if `JourneyStepName` is either undefined or an empty string.
2. If `JourneyStepName` is absent, it proceeds to check if `JourneyStep` has a value.
3. If it does, `JourneyStepName` is constructed by concatenating "Step " with the value of `JourneyStep`.
4. If `JourneyAction` is present and has a value, it appends this value in parentheses to `JourneyStepName`.

### Dependencies
- This code relies on specific keys (`JourneyStep`, `JourneyAction`, and `JourneyStepName`) being present in the `eventPayload` global object. There are no additional dependencies on external libraries.

## 3. Usage Examples
### Normal Conditions
- **Input**: 
    - `eventPayload` contains: 
      ```json
      {
        "JourneyStep": "1",
        "JourneyAction": "Start"
      }
      ```
- **Output**: 
    - `JourneyStepName` will be set to "Step 1 (Start)".

### Edge Conditions
- **Input**:
    - `eventPayload` contains:
      ```json
      {
        "JourneyStep": "2",
        "JourneyAction": ""
      }
      ```
- **Output**:
    - `JourneyStepName` will be set to "Step 2".
  
- **Input**:
    - `eventPayload` contains:
      ```json
      {
        "JourneyStep": "",
        "JourneyAction": ""
      }
      ```
- **Output**:
    - `JourneyStepName` will remain unset (undefined or empty string), since `JourneyStep` has no value.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas
- The extension will not modify the `JourneyStepName` if it is already present. This behaviour might cause confusion if there are cases where it should be updated but isnâ€™t.
- If multiple extensions are modifying `JourneyStepName` independently, it may lead to unintended results. Carefully coordinate variable usage across extensions to avoid overlaps.
- There is no explicit error handling implemented; any unexpected structure in `eventPayload` could break the logic if `JourneyStep` is missing.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring
- **Defensive Checks**: Although not necessary for `eventType` and `eventPayload`, adding checks for `JourneyStep` and `JourneyAction` could prevent potential runtime errors in environments where the data structure could vary.
- **Code Style**: Consistency in spacing and indentation should be observed for improved readability. Maintain uniform comments if noted in other parts of the codebase.
- **Modularization**: The logic could be separated into smaller functions if additional features are anticipated, enhancing testability and maintainability.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes
- **Ownership**: Assign a primary point of contact for any issues arising from this extension, preferably one with familiarity in analytics and Tealium.
- **Testing Guidelines**: Set up a documentation for testing scenarios to validate the expected behaviours of the extension, especially for edge cases that could result in discrepancies in data tracking.
- Regular audits should be performed to ensure the extension continues to function correctly with any updates to related datasets or changes in the Tealium platform.
