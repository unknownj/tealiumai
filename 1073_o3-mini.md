# Documentation for WTA : TAG : Set : Journey Step Name Extension

This document provides a comprehensive overview and explanation of the Tealium iQ extension "WTA : TAG : Set : Journey Step Name", including its purpose, code logic, usage scenarios, potential issues, recommendations for refactoring, and maintenance guidelines.

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** WTA : TAG : Set : Journey Step Name  
- **ID:** 1073 (Extension ID: 100036)  
- **Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** 894  
- **Execution Frequency:**  
  - The code executes on every event where the extension is triggered.
  
**Summary:**  
This extension is designed to set a default value for the variable `JourneyStepName` in the event payload if it is missing or empty. If the payload contains a `JourneyStep` value, the extension constructs a string in the format:  
- "Step [JourneyStep]"  
- "Step [JourneyStep] ([JourneyAction])"  
if an accompanying `JourneyAction` is provided. This ensures that the `JourneyStepName` is always populated, thereby aiding in standardised tracking and reporting of user journey steps.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- **a (eventType):**  
  Although named `a` in the function parameters, this variable represents `eventType`. It is available from the Tealium environment and indicates the type of event.

- **b (eventPayload):**  
  This object contains all the data passed along with the event. The extension processes properties from this object such as `JourneyStepName`, `JourneyStep`, and `JourneyAction`.

- **u (tagObject):**  
  Represents additional tag configuration data. It is not directly utilised within the extension code but is passed as a parameter.

### Logic Flow
1. **Initial Check for JourneyStepName:**  
   The code first checks if `JourneyStepName` is either undefined or an empty string.  
   ```javascript
   if (!b.JourneyStepName || b.JourneyStepName === "")
   ```
2. **Constructing JourneyStepName:**  
   - **Condition on JourneyStep:**  
     The code then checks if `JourneyStep` exists and is not an empty string.  
     ```javascript
     if (b.JourneyStep && b.JourneyStep !== "")
     {
       b.JourneyStepName = "Step " + b.JourneyStep;
     ```
   - **Append JourneyAction if Present:**  
     If `JourneyAction` is provided and non-empty, it appends this to `JourneyStepName` in parentheses.  
     ```javascript
       if (b.JourneyAction && b.JourneyAction !== "")
       {
         b.JourneyStepName += " (" + b.JourneyAction + ")";
       }
     }
     ```
     
### Dependencies
- **Global Objects/Libraries:**  
  This extension depends on the predefined Tealium objects `eventType`, `eventPayload`, and `tagObject`. No external libraries are required.
- **Assumptions:**  
  It is assumed that the extension will be executed where these objects are reliably available.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Example 1: Setting JourneyStepName with both JourneyStep and JourneyAction
- **Input:**  
  ```javascript
  eventPayload: {
    JourneyStepName: "", 
    JourneyStep: "2",
    JourneyAction: "Click"
  }
  ```
- **Output:**  
  ```javascript
  eventPayload.JourneyStepName = "Step 2 (Click)";
  ```

### Example 2: Setting JourneyStepName with only JourneyStep available
- **Input:**  
  ```javascript
  eventPayload: {
    JourneyStepName: "", 
    JourneyStep: "3",
    JourneyAction: ""
  }
  ```
- **Output:**  
  ```javascript
  eventPayload.JourneyStepName = "Step 3";
  ```

### Example 3: No action if JourneyStepName is already populated
- **Input:**  
  ```javascript
  eventPayload: {
    JourneyStepName: "Custom Step",
    JourneyStep: "4",
    JourneyAction: "Submit"
  }
  ```
- **Output:**  
  The script does not modify `JourneyStepName` since it already contains a value.

### Example 4: No action if both JourneyStepName and JourneyStep are empty
- **Input:**  
  ```javascript
  eventPayload: {
    JourneyStepName: "", 
    JourneyStep: "",
    JourneyAction: "Click"
  }
  ```
- **Output:**  
  `JourneyStepName` remains an empty string because the necessary `JourneyStep` is not provided.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Pre-existence of JourneyStepName:**  
  If `JourneyStepName` is already set (non-empty), the extension does not overwrite it even if it might be an outdated or inaccurate value.
  
- **Dependency on JourneyStep:**  
  The creation of `JourneyStepName` relies solely on the presence of `JourneyStep`. If only `JourneyAction` is available, the code will not set a default name.

- **Order of Execution:**  
  The extension may depend on the order of execution. If another extension modifies `JourneyStep` or `JourneyAction` after this code runs, it might lead to unexpected results.

- **Concurrency/Other Scripts:**  
  Potential conflicts can arise if other Tealium extensions or external scripts modify the same `eventPayload` properties concurrently.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Additional Defensive Checks:**  
  Although defensive coding for the availability of `eventType` and `eventPayload` is not required, consider adding checks for property types if future modifications demand more robust validation.
  
- **Code Readability:**  
  Adding comments within the code can help future developers understand the intent and flow. For instance, document the reason for each conditional structure.
  
- **Modularisation:**  
  If further logic is added, consider refactoring into separate functions (while remaining within ES5 standards) to improve modularity and readability.
  
- **Variable Naming:**  
  Use more descriptive parameter names (e.g. rename `a`, `b`, and `u` to `eventType`, `eventPayload`, and `tagObject` respectively) for better understanding by other developers. (Note: this change is cosmetic and should be validated for consistency across the Tealium environment.)
  
- **Documentation:**  
  Keep inline documentation up to date with any changes to ensure that the purpose and flow of the code remain clear.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  - Regularly review the functionality of the extension when updating related Tealium configurations.
  - Monitor for changes in the event payload structure or additional requirements that may impact the logic.
  
- **Ownership:**  
  - Assign clear ownership for the maintenance of this extension so that any issues arising from integration with new or updated third-party scripts can be addressed promptly.
  
- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Test the extension thoroughly in various scenarios (edge cases as well as common use cases) to ensure that the default assignment behaves as expected.
  - Validate the execution order when multiple extensions are in play to prevent unexpected overrides.
  
- **Change Management:**  
  - Keep a changelog for modifications to this code within your version control system.
  - Use comments in the code to reference update dates and rationale for changes.
