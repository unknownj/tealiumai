# WTA : TAG : Set : Reporting Action & Narrative with Journey Variables

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** WTA : TAG : Set : Reporting Action & Narrative with Journey Variables  
- **ID:** 1076  
- **Extension Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** 894  
- **Execution Frequency:** Executed on every tag event that meets the load rule (if applicable)

**Summary:**  
This extension is designed to set two key variables—ReportingAction and ReportingActionNarrative—for outbound analytics tags. Initially, these variables are populated with the values from the default EventAction and EventNarrative fields. However, if a special JourneyAction is available and not empty, the extension overrides these values with JourneyAction and its corresponding string, JourneyActionNarrative. This logic assists in aligning analytics tracking with specific journey variables when available.

---

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- **eventType:** Represents the event context (typically indicating the type of analytics event) and serves as the first parameter in the immediately invoked function.
- **eventPayload:** Contains the payload data (or event data) associated with the current event; this is the second parameter.
- **tagObject (u):** Represents the tag object and is passed as the third parameter. It functions as a container for data that is used by the tag.
- **b:** Alias for eventPayload, used to access and assign variable values.
- **ReportingAction & ReportingActionNarrative:**  
  - Initially set to the values of EventAction and EventNarrative respectively.
  - May be overridden by JourneyAction and JourneyActionNarrative if JourneyAction is defined and non-empty.

### Logic Flow
1. **Initial Assignment:**  
   The code first assigns:
   - b.ReportingAction = b.EventAction  
   - b.ReportingActionNarrative = b.EventNarrative  

2. **Conditional Override:**  
   The extension then checks:
   - If b.JourneyAction exists and is not an empty string.
   - If the condition is met, it reassigns:
     - b.ReportingAction = b.JourneyAction  
     - b.ReportingActionNarrative = b.JourneyActionNarrative  

This means that in cases where journey-specific tracking data is provided, the tracking values for ReportingAction and ReportingActionNarrative will be updated accordingly.

### Dependencies
- The code relies on two JavaScript objects:  
  - The global eventPayload (aliased as b), which must contain keys for EventAction, EventNarrative, JourneyAction, and JourneyActionNarrative.
  - The eventType parameter, although it is not explicitly used in this snippet.
- No external libraries are referenced; the code is self-contained.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Default Behaviour
- **Input:**  
  eventPayload contains:  
  - EventAction = "click"  
  - EventNarrative = "Button clicked"  
  - JourneyAction = undefined or an empty string  
- **Result:**  
  - ReportingAction will remain "click".  
  - ReportingActionNarrative will remain "Button clicked".

### Scenario 2: Override with Journey Variables
- **Input:**  
  eventPayload contains:  
  - EventAction = "click"  
  - EventNarrative = "Button clicked"  
  - JourneyAction = "journey_start"  
  - JourneyActionNarrative = "Journey has begun"  
- **Result:**  
  - ReportingAction will update to "journey_start".  
  - ReportingActionNarrative will update to "Journey has begun".

### Edge Condition: JourneyAction is an Empty String
- **Input:**  
  eventPayload contains:  
  - EventAction = "submit"  
  - EventNarrative = "Form submission"  
  - JourneyAction = ""  
  - JourneyActionNarrative = "Should not override"  
- **Result:**  
  - ReportingAction remains "submit".  
  - ReportingActionNarrative remains "Form submission" since an empty string does not trigger the override.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Data Availability:**  
  The extension assumes that all required properties (EventAction, EventNarrative) are present in the eventPayload. If these properties are missing, the default values will be undefined.

- **Empty String Check:**  
  The override logic only checks whether `JourneyAction` is non-empty. There is no handling for cases where JourneyAction might contain only whitespace.

- **Potential Conflict:**  
  If another extension or external script alters the same variables (ReportingAction or ReportingActionNarrative) later in the processing sequence, it might conflict with the outputs of this extension. Consider sequencing when applying multiple extensions that manipulate these same keys.

- **Global Dependency:**  
  Although the extension does not depend on external libraries, it does depend on correctly named keys within eventPayload. Typos or mismatches could lead to issues.

---

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks:**  
  Although it is assumed that eventPayload contains the expected structure, consider verifying that JourneyActionNarrative exists (if not empty) before assigning. For example:
  
  // if(typeof b.JourneyActionNarrative !== 'undefined') {...}
  
- **Commenting & Code Style:**  
  Adding inline comments to clarify the purpose of each block of code can help future developers understand the logic flow. This is especially important when multiple sources of values are anticipated.

- **Modularisation:**  
  If the logic for handling event variables grows more complex, consider modularising the code into helper functions. This may enhance readability and maintainability while keeping the extension compliant with ES5.

- **Code Clarity:**  
  Ensure consistent naming conventions and spacing. Though minor, these improvements aid in long-term maintainability.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Testing:**  
  Regular testing should be performed across different environments to ensure that the eventPayload values are correctly mapped. Consider implementing unit tests that simulate both default and override behavior.

- **Ownership:**  
  Clearly document the extension’s functionality within your team’s code repository. Assign an owner who is responsible for maintaining the code, handling bug reports, and overseeing enhancements.

- **Version Control:**  
  Keep the code in a version control system (e.g., GitHub) with proper commit messages explaining any changes, especially those that affect the tracking logic.

- **Documentation Updates:**  
  Update this documentation whenever the business logic or underlying process changes. Regular reviews will help avoid misalignment between the code and its documented behaviour.

- **Legacy Support:**  
  Since ES5 is a requirement, always test changes against environments that do not support ES6 features to ensure continued compatibility.
