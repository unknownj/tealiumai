# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** WTA : TAG : Set : Send Retarget Variables  
- **Extension ID:** 100036 (library metadata), Internal ID: 1077  
- **Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** 894  
- **Execution Frequency:** Executed per event processing during the Tealium iQ tag run

**Summary:**  
This extension is designed to manage the sending of retarget variables. Its primary purpose is to evaluate the current application state and journey actions. If the state or action matches any in the predefined suppression lists, a suppression flag (SendRetargetSuppress) is set to prevent the transmission of retarget variables. Conversely, if the conditions pass and all required retarget parameters are available, these values are copied to new properties (prefixed with SendRetarget...) to facilitate further processing in the analytics or targeting workflows.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables:
- **a, b, u:**  
  - Passed into the immediately invoked function as `eventType`, `eventPayload`, and `tagObject` respectively.  
- **appStatus:**  
  - Derived from `b.ApplicationStateInternal` if available; otherwise, it falls back to `b.ApplicationState`. This variable represents the current application status.
- **statusConfig:**  
  - An ES5 object listing application statuses for which retargeting should be suppressed (e.g. "Referred", "Declined", "Fulfilled", etc.). Each key maps to a boolean `true` value.  
- **actionConfig:**  
  - An ES5 object listing journey actions (like "d3", "Downsell", "Application Processing", etc.) that should also trigger suppression of retarget variables.

### Logic Flow:
1. **Determine Application Status:**  
   - The code retrieves the application's status (via `ApplicationStateInternal` or `ApplicationState`) and assigns it to `appStatus`.
  
2. **Apply Suppression Using Status:**  
   - If `appStatus` matches any key in `statusConfig`, the code sets `b.SendRetargetSuppress` to the string `"yes"`. This flag prevents the later assignment of retarget variables.

3. **Apply Suppression Using Journey Action:**  
   - Independently, if `b.JourneyAction` exists in `actionConfig`, the code also sets `b.SendRetargetSuppress` to `"yes"`.

4. **Variable Assignment Block:**  
   - Only if `b.SendRetargetSuppress` is not set (i.e. remains falsy) and **all** of the following variables are truthy:
     - `RetargetEmail`
     - `RetargetPostcode`
     - `RetargetProduct`
     - `ProductGroup`
     - `ReturnURL`
     - `RetargetSurname`
     - `RetargetTitle`  
   - Then, the extension copies each of these values to new properties prefixed with `SendRetarget` (e.g. `SendRetargetEmail`, `SendRetargetPostcode`, etc.) to indicate that retargeting information should be sent.

### Dependencies:
- **Global Objects / Properties:**  
  - The extension depends on the properties that exist on the event payload object, namely: `ApplicationStateInternal`, `ApplicationState`, `JourneyAction`, and the retarget-related fields.
  - It is assumed that `eventType` (a string) and `eventPayload` (an object) are always provided by the Tealium iQ environment.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Scenario (No Suppression):
- **Input Data:**  
  - `b.ApplicationState` is "Processing" (not in `statusConfig`), and `b.JourneyAction` is "p" (if "p" is not part of `actionConfig`, or considered acceptable in the current logic)  
  - All required fields for retargeting (`RetargetEmail`, `RetargetPostcode`, `RetargetProduct`, `ProductGroup`, `ReturnURL`, `RetargetSurname`, `RetargetTitle`) are present and truthy.
  
- **Behaviour:**  
  - Since neither `appStatus` nor `JourneyAction` trigger suppression, the code assigns the provided retarget values to their corresponding `SendRetarget*` counterparts.  

### Edge Condition Scenario (Suppression via Status):
- **Input Data:**  
  - `b.ApplicationState` is "Referred" (which is in `statusConfig`).
  
- **Behaviour:**  
  - The code immediately sets `b.SendRetargetSuppress` to `"yes"`, and no further assignment of the retarget variables is performed, regardless of whether all other values are present.

### Edge Condition Scenario (Suppression via Journey Action):
- **Input Data:**  
  - `b.JourneyAction` is "d3" (listed in `actionConfig`).
  
- **Behaviour:**  
  - As soon as the condition is met, `b.SendRetargetSuppress` is set to `"yes"`, and no retarget values are assigned even if they are present.

### Missing Required Data:
- **Input Data:**  
  - All conditions for suppression are not met, but one or more of the required retarget variables (e.g. `RetargetEmail`) is missing or falsy.
  
- **Behaviour:**  
  - The check fails, and therefore none of the retarget variables are copied to the `SendRetarget*` properties. This prevents partial data being sent.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Falsiness vs Valid Data:**  
  - The extension uses truthiness checks for required fields. This may lead to issues if any valid field value is falsy (for example, an empty string might be considered missing).
  
- **Overriding Suppression Flags:**  
  - If any other Tealium or external script sets `b.SendRetargetSuppress` before this code runs, the assignment block will be skipped.
  
- **Order of Execution:**  
  - Care must be taken with the order in which multiple extensions or scripts are executed. If other extensions manipulate the same variables (especially retarget-related fields), unexpected behaviour may result.
  
- **Dependency on Global Variables:**  
  - The extension assumes that certain properties (e.g. `ApplicationStateInternal`, `JourneyAction`) exist in the event payload. If any of these properties are missing due to misconfiguration upstream, the expected logic may not execute properly.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Enhanced Comments & Documentation:**  
  - Even though the code is relatively short, inline comments could be further enhanced to describe the purpose behind each block of logic.

- **Variable Naming & Readability:**  
  - Using more descriptive variable names instead of short names like “b” would improve readability. Although ES5 constraints apply, clearer naming conventions (if permitted within the given environment) may help future maintainers.

- **Modularisation:**  
  - Consider breaking the suppression logic and the retarget assignment into separate functions to improve maintainability. For example, one function to check suppression conditions and another to perform assignments.
  
- **Defensive Coding:**  
  - While it is stated that `eventType` and `eventPayload` are guaranteed to be present, consider adding additional logging or error handling for other critical fields if business requirements change.

- **Centralised Configuration:**  
  - Moving `statusConfig` and `actionConfig` to a centralised configuration file or object (if feasible) might simplify future updates to the suppression criteria.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Regular Review:**  
  - The lists in `statusConfig` and `actionConfig` should be reviewed regularly to ensure they align with evolving business needs.

- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Before deploying changes to production, test all scenarios in a staging environment, including:
    - Cases where suppression is triggered by application status.
    - Cases where suppression is triggered by journey action.
    - Cases where all required retarget variables are present or missing.
    
- **Ownership & Version Control:**  
  - Establish clear ownership of this extension among the development team. Changes should be tracked via version control and go through a code review process.
  
- **Integration Points:**  
  - Monitor any potential conflicts with other Tealium extensions or external scripts that manipulate the same or related variables. Clear documentation of integration points can help avoid duplication or conflicts.

- **Future Enhancements:**  
  - As business logic evolves, consider refactoring to a more modular and testable structure while still supporting ES5 code standards.
