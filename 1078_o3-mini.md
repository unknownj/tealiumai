# WTA : TAG : Set : Consent Cookie Status Extension Documentation

This document provides an in-depth explanation of the Tealium iQ extension "WTA : TAG : Set : Consent Cookie Status" including its overview, code explanation, usage examples, known limitations, recommendations for refactoring, and maintenance notes.

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** WTA : TAG : Set : Consent Cookie Status  
- **Extension ID:** 1078  
- **Tealium Extension ID:** 100036  
- **Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** 894  
- **Execution Frequency:** Executed within the event payload processing workflow (each time an event is processed where the provided payload contains the consent cookie keys)

**Summary:**  
This extension modifies the incoming event payload to adapt the Cookie Consent values for WebTrends tracking. Specifically, it converts consent flag values from booleans (true/false) into string representations of integers ('1' for true and '0' for false) to satisfy the data format requirements of WebTrends. This ensures that the data sent for cookie consents is correctly formatted for reporting and analytics.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Variables and Parameters
- **eventType:** A global variable passed into the extension representing the type of event.  
- **eventPayload (referenced as 'b'):** A global object containing various event parameters including cookie consent values.  
- **tagObject (referenced as 'u'):** A global object providing context for the tag execution.  

### Logic Flow
1. **Self-Executing Function:**  
   The extension code is wrapped in an immediately-invoked function expression (IIFE) that takes three parameters: eventType, eventPayload, and tagObject. This ensures that any variables or logic contained within the extension remain scoped locally.

2. **Consent Values Conversion:**  
   The primary purpose of the function is to convert the boolean consent flags into string-based integer representations:
   - It checks for the presence of the key `CookiesFunctional` in the event payload.  
     - If found and its value is `true`, it sets the key to the string `'1'`.
     - If the value is `false`, it sets the key to the string `'0'`.
   - The same process is repeated for the keys `CookiesPerformance` and `CookiesTargeting`.

3. **Boolean Evaluation:**  
   For each consent value, the expression `(b['...']) ? '1' : '0'` evaluates the boolean truthiness. This is a concise way to convert a boolean value into the expected string format.

### Dependencies
- This extension does not import or rely on any external libraries apart from the standard global objects provided by Tealium iQ (eventType, eventPayload, tagObject).

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Scenario

- **Event Payload Pre-Processing:**  
  Assume the incoming event payload is as follows:
  
  {
    "CookiesFunctional": true,
    "CookiesPerformance": false,
    "CookiesTargeting": true
  }

- **Processing Logic:**  
  1. The function checks and converts:
     - `CookiesFunctional` becomes '1'
     - `CookiesPerformance` becomes '0'
     - `CookiesTargeting` becomes '1'
     
- **Event Payload Post-Processing:**  

  {
    "CookiesFunctional": "1",
    "CookiesPerformance": "0",
    "CookiesTargeting": "1"
  }

### Edge Scenario

- **Partial Data Scenario:**  
  If the event payload contains only one or two of the three keys, the function only processes those that exist.
  
  Example:
  
  {
    "CookiesFunctional": false
  }
  
  After processing:
  
  {
    "CookiesFunctional": "0"
  }
  
  Keys `CookiesPerformance` and `CookiesTargeting` remain unaltered (or are absent), providing flexibility with incomplete payloads.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Key Existence Dependence:**  
  The code checks for the presence of each cookie consent key using `hasOwnProperty`. If the event payload does not include these keys, no changes will be made. Ensure that the keys exist when necessary.

- **Type Conversion Assumptions:**  
  The extension assumes that the values corresponding to the consent keys are actual booleans. If these keys inadvertently hold non-boolean values (e.g. numbers, strings), the conversion logic might not yield the expected integer representation.

- **Execution Order:**  
  Be mindful when multiple extensions operate on the same consent cookie keys. Conflicts can occur if another extension also modifies the same keys after this one has run. The order of execution in Tealium might affect data consistency.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Code Readability:**  
  Although the code is concise, consider adding more inline comments especially if further modifications are anticipated. Detailed commenting can help future maintainers understand why each section exists.

- **Modularisation:**  
  While the code is already encapsulated in an IIFE, consider abstracting the conversion logic to a separate reusable function if similar operations are being carried out elsewhere within Tealium.

- **Consistency in Data Types:**  
  Ensure that the transformation always yields string outputs to avoid any implicit type conversion problems in downstream systems.  
  (Note: Since ES5 is required, avoid the usage of ES6 syntax such as arrow functions, template literals, let/const, etc.)

- **Defensive Programming:**  
  Even though the availability of eventType and eventPayload is guaranteed, it might be worth logging a warning (if logging is supported) when unexpected data types for consent values are detected to aid in future debugging.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  - Regularly review the extension to ensure compatibility with any updates to WebTrends data collection requirements.  
  - Monitor for any changes in the structure of eventPayloads within your organisation, as adjustments may be necessary.

- **Ownership:**  
  Assign a maintainer or team responsible for monitoring this extension. Documentation updates should be performed in tandem with code changes to ensure both remain consistent.

- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Implement unit tests to validate proper conversion of consent flags from boolean to string representations.  
  - Test both complete and partial payloads to verify that the extension handles missing keys gracefully.  
  - Incorporate logging for error cases (if allowed by your deployment pipeline) to facilitate debugging in production.

- **Stakeholder Communication:**  
  Maintain communication with both analytics and development teams to ensure that any changes in the tracking requirements or event payload structures are promptly addressed in this extension.
