# Documentation for Tealium iQ Extension: OWC : TAG : Load : Vendor Tag Resources

## 1. Extension Overview
- **Name**: OWC : TAG : Load : Vendor Tag Resources
- **ID**: 100036
- **Type**: JavaScript Code
- **Scope**: 895
- **Execution Frequency**: Each time the page loads

### Summary
This Tealium iQ extension facilitates the loading of vendor-specific web chat resources based on the brand and platform detected from the `clova3` data layer. It sets unique operational identifiers (UOIDs) and URLs for different brands, enabling proper routing and functionality of the web chat service across various environments (i.e., testing and production).

## 2. Code Explanation
### Key Variables
- **`c3`**: A reference to the global `clova3` object, facilitating easy access to its properties and methods.
- **`platform`**: Retrieved from the datalayer to determine if the environment is a test or production environment.
- **`brand`**: Also retrieved from the datalayer used to set the appropriate URL for web chat resources.
- **`url`**: Base URL that changes according to the brand and platform conditions.

### Logic Flow
1. **Loading initiated**: The extension logs that web chat resources are loading.
2. **Object Check**: It verifies that `clova3.datalayer` exists; if not, a log message is generated.
3. **Platform Handling**: 
   - If the `platform` is "test", it checks if the hostname contains "luat" to set a different UOID.
   - If the platform is not "test", it sets the live UOID.
4. **URL Determination**: 
   - Based on the `brand`, it sets the correct URL for the web chat service.
   - If the page path matches certain conditions (like `/sharedealing/`), the URL is altered to point to specific share dealing resources.
5. **Resource Loading**: The extension checks if the `u` object is not loaded and appends the necessary JavaScript resource paths.
6. **Event Handlers Setup**: It creates various event handlers that trigger tracking events based on web chat interactions.

### Dependencies
- Uses the `clova3`, `ATGSvcs`, and `utag` global objects, which are expected to be available in the environment where the extension runs.
- Relies on specific data available in the `datalayer`.

## 3. Usage Examples
### Normal Flow
1. When a user visits a Lloyds page on the production environment, the extension sets the UOID using `200106303679` and loads the necessary scripts from `https://help.lloydsbank.co.uk`.
2. The user interacts with the web chat, and various analytics events are logged (e.g., `eeAccepted`, `eeDeclined`).

### Edge Cases
- If an unknown brand is encountered, it throws an error: `"Can't deploy Webchat, no brand found"`.
- If the page path is related to share dealing, the URL is altered to match the share dealing resources, ensuring the user receives the correct assistance.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas
- **Dependency on Global Variables**: The absence of the `clova3` object means the extension wonâ€™t run, which may lead to unintended errors in its absence.
- **Brand Handling**: If new brands are added without updating this logic, the extension will fail to find a corresponding URL.
- **URL Manipulation**: Hardcoded URLs may need updates if the target domains change.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring
- **Defensive Checks**: Consider adding checks before accessing properties on `b` to avoid possible runtime errors.
- **Code Style**: Consistent logging, using a more structured error handling mechanism would enhance maintainability.
- **Modularisation**: Breaking down this logic into functions (e.g., for setting UOID, determining URLs) would improve readability and simplify testing.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes
- **Ownership**: Assign a dedicated team or individual to monitor changes in the brands or platforms that this extension impacts.
- **Testing**: Regularly test the extension in both test and production environments, especially when new brands or platforms are added.
- **Documentation Updates**: Keep the documentation updated as changes are made to the code, especially around URLs, UOIDs, and brand definitions.
