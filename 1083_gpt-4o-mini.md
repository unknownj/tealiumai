# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: OWC : TAG : Load : Vendor Tag Resources

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name**: OWC : TAG : Load : Vendor Tag Resources
- **ID**: 100036
- **Type**: Javascript Code
- **Scope**: 895
- **Execution Frequency**: Active

### Summary
This extension is designed to load vendor-specific resources for a web chat functionality on a banking platform. It checks the current platform and brand from the `clova3` data layer, sets URLs for loading required scripts, and logs interactions with the web chat. The extension ensures that the correct resources are loaded based on the environment (test vs live) and the brand in use.

---

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- `c3`: Reference to `window.clova3`, the primary object containing the data layer.
- `platform` and `brand`: Retrieved values from the data layer, indicating the current platform and brand.
- `url`: Constructed URL to load vendor-specific resources.

### Logic Flow
1. **Initialization**: The script starts by logging that Webchat is being loaded.
2. **Data Layer Check**: It checks if the `clova3` object exists and logs an error if not found.
3. **Platform Handling**: Depending on whether the platform is "test" or live, it sets a unique identifier (`UOID`) for loading resources.
4. **Brand-Based URL Construction**: A URL specific to the brand and platform is built. An error is thrown if the brand is not recognised.
5. **Sharedealing URL Adjustments**: Additional adjustments to the constructed URL are made for certain paths.
6. **Resource Loading**: If the resources are not already loaded, they are fetched.
7. **Event Handlers Setup**: The function `atgAnalytics` is defined to handle various events related to the web chat interactions.
8. **Logging Completion**: Logs the completion of the extension setup.

### Dependencies
- Relies on the global object `window.clova3` and its data layer.
- Utilises the external `ATGSvcs` service for loading resources and managing analytics.
- Assumes the availability of the `utag` object for passing event analytics.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Operation
- When a user accesses the site on the Lloyds banking platform in a live environment, the extension will log messages indicating the loading of the web chat and will set the live resource URL:
    ```
    "Loading Webchat", "Webchat on live/Lloyds"
    ```

### Test Scenario
- If the same user accesses via a test platform and the hostname includes "luat", the extension will set the appropriate test UOID and log:
    ```
    "Setting live key for LUAT", "Loading Webchat Resources"
    ```

### Edge Case
- If no matching brand is found during the URL construction, an error will be thrown:
    ```
    "Can't deploy Webchat, no brand found"
    ```

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Brand Not Found**: If an unsupported brand is detected or not specified in the switch statement, the extension will throw an error.
- **Dependency on Global Objects**: The code assumes `window.clova3`, `ATGSvcs`, and `utag` are always available, which could lead to runtime errors if these resources are not loaded beforehand.
- **Path Dependency**: The handling of the URL for "sharedealing" paths depends on precise URL structure, which can cause issues if future paths are added or modified.
  
---

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks**: Add checks to verify that necessary dependencies (`window.clova3`, `ATGSvcs`, `utag`) are loaded before proceeding, logging errors if they are not found.
- **Modularisation**: Separate the logic into functions (such as for URL construction and loading resources) to improve readability and maintainability. For example, creating a function for handling the URL based on brand and environment.
- **Consolidate Logging**: Create a centralized logging function to avoid repetition and improve manageability.

---

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance**: Ensure the extension is tested when new brands or platforms are added. Regular review of the URLs and conditions is recommended to prevent errors as codebases change.
- **Ownership**: Designate a specific team member or team for ownership of this extension to ensure accountability for its upkeep.
- **Testing Guidelines**: Implement a series of unit tests that cover various scenarios (live/test platforms, supported brands, unsupported brands) to ensure robust handling of different paths through the code.
