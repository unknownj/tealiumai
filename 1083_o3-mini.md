# OWC : TAG : Load : Vendor Tag Resources

This document provides detailed documentation on the Tealium iQ extension that loads vendor tag resources for a webchat function. It covers an overview of the extension, a detailed code explanation, usage examples, known limitations, recommendations for refactoring, and maintenance notes.

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** OWC : TAG : Load : Vendor Tag Resources  
- **Extension ID:** 1083  
- **Extension Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** 895  
- **Execution Frequency:** Runs on every page load (as determined by the Tealium iQ tag load environment)

**Summary:**  
This extension is designed to load the vendor specific webchat and support resources for different banking brands. It serves to initialise the webchat environment by:  
- Logging the load event.  
- Verifying and using data from the global `clova3` object (which includes a data layer for retrieving platform and brand details).  
- Determining the appropriate UOID (unique object identifier) based on the current platform (test or live) and the hostname conditions.  
- Setting URLs to load support resources based on the brand (e.g. Lloyds, Halifax, BOS, MBNA) with exceptions applied for certain product paths (such as sharedealing or investments).  
- Registering various custom events via `ATGSvcs.rules.analytics.launch` that eventually push events to Tealium’s `utag.link` for tracking.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables & Global Objects

- **Global Variables:**
  - `window.clova3`: A global object used for logging and accessing the `datalayer`. It must be previously defined.
  - `window.ATGSvcs`: A global object used to set configuration (UOID and additional settings) and launch analytics event rules.
  - `utag.link`: A Tealium function used to send tracking calls.

- **Parameters Passed:**  
  The extension function receives three parameters:
  - `a`: Corresponds to `eventType` (String).
  - `b`: Corresponds to `eventPayload` (Object).
  - `u`: Corresponds to `tagObject`. It is used to keep track of whether resources have been loaded and to trigger the loading via its `loader()` function.

### Logic Flow

1. **Initial Logging and Data Layer Verification:**  
   - The extension logs a “Loading Webchat” message.  
   - It then checks whether `window.clova3` and `window.clova3.datalayer` exist. If not, it logs an error message indicating that the data layer is not found.

2. **Platform & Brand Extraction:**  
   - Retrieves the current `Platform` and `Brand` values from `clova3.datalayer`.
   - Logs the platform and brand information.

3. **UOID Configuration Based on Platform:**  
   - A `switch` statement on the `platform` value determines which UOID to set.  
   - For the "test" platform, a special case for the hostname containing "luat" is verified.
   - For other platforms (default), the live UOID is set.

4. **Vendor Resource URL Determination:**  
   - The code defines an empty `url` variable that is later modified based on the `Brand` value.
   - Another `switch` statement on `brand` sets the URL for help or support pages.  
   - If the brand is not recognised, the code throws an exception.

5. **Handling Sharedealing Exceptions:**  
   - Checks the browser URL’s pathname for sharedealing or investment related pages.
   - If the pathname matches, the URL is modified accordingly to serve the sharedealing version of the resources.

6. **Loading Vendor Resources:**  
   - The extension checks if the vendor resources have already been loaded (using `u.loaded` flag).
   - If not, it sets the flag to `true` and loads two resource scripts (`vsapi.js` and `vsopts.js`) by appending the constructed URL.

7. **Event Handler Creation for Webchat Analytics:**  
   - A context string (`webChatContext`) is constructed based on available properties in `eventPayload` (such as `JourneyName`, `ProductGroup`, or `ProductSubGroup`).
   - Defines a function `window.atgAnalytics` that leverages `ATGSvcs.rules.analytics.launch` to register callbacks for various webchat events (e.g. `eeCustomEvent`, `eeOffered`, `eeAccepted`, and so on).
   - Each event callback sends a tracking call using `utag.link`, with custom key/value pairs to capture stage details of the webchat process.

8. **Completion:**  
   - Logs a “Done” message to signify that the extension script has finished execution.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Flow Example

- **On a Test Environment for Lloyds Brand:**
  - Data layer `Platform` returns "test" and `Brand` returns "Lloyds".  
  - The script sets a test UOID by checking if the hostname contains "luat" or not.  
  - The URL is determined as either `"https://lloydsbank--tst.custhelp.com"` or the live version based on the platform.
  - If the page URL does not indicate “sharedealing”, the URL remains unchanged.
  - The vendor JS files (`vsapi.js` and `vsopts.js`) are loaded, and the custom event handlers for webchat analytics are registered.

- **Event Tracking Scenario:**  
  - When an event (e.g. `eeAccepted`) occurs, the corresponding callback sends a tracking call with key details like `JourneyStep`, `JourneyStepName`, and `JourneyProduct` to Tealium using `utag.link`.  
  - This allows the analytics system to log when a user accepts the webchat offer.

### Edge Conditions

- **Missing Data Layer:**  
  - If `window.clova3` or its `datalayer` is not defined, the script logs an error but does not halt further execution.  
- **Unrecognised Brand:**  
  - If the brand extracted from `clova3.datalayer` does not match one of the known brands (Lloyds, Halifax, BOS, MBNA), the script throws an error indicating that it cannot deploy Webchat.

- **Sharedealing Paths:**  
  - For URL paths starting with “/sharedealing/”, “/investments/”, or “/share-dealing/”, the URL is adjusted to reflect sharedealing-specific resources. If the live URLs match known domains, they change to sharedealing versions.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Global Dependency Risks:**  
  - The extension relies on the existence and correct configuration of globals such as `window.clova3`, `ATGSvcs`, and `utag`.  
  - If any of these objects are missing or misconfigured, the extension might not behave as expected.

- **Strict Brand Matching:**  
  - The `brand` lookup is case-sensitive and only supports a specific set of hard-coded brands. Any unrecognised brand will cause the extension to throw an error.

- **URL Handling Complexity:**  
  - The logic that determines the URL, particularly the sharedealing exceptions, depends on string matching which might lead to unintended behaviour if the URL structure changes.

- **Potential Race Conditions:**  
  - If other Tealium extensions or external scripts manipulate the same global objects or modify the data layer concurrently, conflicts may occur.

- **Loading State Flag:**  
  - The extension uses a simple flag (`u.loaded`) to check if the resources have been loaded, which might not be sufficient in all complex page load scenarios.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Enhanced Defensive Checks:**  
  - Although the availability of `eventType` and `eventPayload` is guaranteed, consider verifying the existence/structure of critical globals (e.g. `clova3`, `ATGSvcs`, `utag`) more robustly before proceeding.  
  - Introduce additional error handling (for example, using try/catch) around network or script load calls to manage potential failures gracefully.

- **Modularise Code:**  
  - Extract repeated logic (such as URL construction and sharedealing exception handling) into separate helper functions. This will improve readability and enable easier testing and updates.
  - Consider refactoring the switch statements into configuration objects or maps for easier maintenance and extension.

- **Logging Improvements:**  
  - Centralise logging functionality so that log messages can be easily toggled or redirected through a dedicated logging module.
  
- **Documentation and Comments:**  
  - Enhance inline comments further to document assumptions and the reasoning behind key decision points in the code.
  
- **ES5 Compliance:**  
  - Ensure that any refactoring continues to support ES5. Avoid using ES6 syntax (e.g. arrow functions, template literals, let/const) as the environment requires ES5.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  - Clearly document the owners of this extension (e.g. Web Analytics or Web Operations teams) and ensure that there is a process in place for regular reviews and updates.
  - Regularly test changes in both test and live environments to confirm that dependency updates in `ATGSvcs` or vendor scripts do not break the integration.

- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Develop unit and integration tests that simulate various conditions: test vs. live environments, recognised vs. unrecognised brands, and correct URL path adjustments.
  - Monitor logs to verify that event handlers fire as expected and that resource loading flags behave correctly.

- **Version Control & Change Management:**  
  - Keep the extension code in a version-controlled repository and use code reviews to ensure changes meet coding standards and maintain the integrity of global dependency handling.
  - Update the documentation periodically to reflect changes made during the refactoring or as new requirements arise.

- **Stakeholder Communication:**  
  - Inform relevant teams (e.g. marketing, web development) about any changes that could impact data collection or vendor resource loading, so that the analytics and webchat functionalities remain in sync.
