# WTA : TAG : Set : Tealium Version

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** WTA : TAG : Set : Tealium Version
- **ID:** 1085 (Extension ID: 100036)
- **Type:** Javascript Code
- **Scope:** 894
- **Execution Frequency:** Runs per event (each time an event payload is processed)

**Summary:**  
This extension augments the existing Tealium version information with additional details about the Tealium iQ library version and environment. Specifically, it parses the version string from a global property, appends the most granular version segment, and, if the environment is not production ("prod"), further appends the environment name. Additionally, the extension updates the page's document title by prefixing it with the environment name if it is not already present. This is useful for debugging and verifying that the correct version and environment are active.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- **a, b, u:**  
  - The function parameters represent the event type (`a`), event payload (`b`), and tag object (`u`).  
  - The event payload (`b`) is used to access various Tealium properties.
- **utv:**  
  - Initially retrieves the Tealium version from the property `b["ut.version"]` and splits it into parts using the dot (".") as the delimiter.  
  - Only the last segment of the version is retained.
- **b.FullTealiumVersion:**  
  - A new property assigned to the event payload that concatenates `b.TealiumVersion` with the last segment of `b["ut.version"]` using a slash ("/").
- **ute:**  
  - Reads the environment variable from `b["ut.env"]` (e.g. "prod", "dev", "qa").

### Logic Flow
1. **Version Parsing:**  
   - The code splits the version string from `b["ut.version"]` by the period (".") and extracts the last segment.
2. **Version Augmentation:**  
   - The extracted segment is appended to the main Tealium version (`b.TealiumVersion`) to form a new version string (`b.FullTealiumVersion`).
3. **Environment Specific Logic:**  
   - If the environment (`ute`) is not "prod":
     - The environment name is appended to `b.FullTealiumVersion`.
     - The page’s document title is inspected. If the title does not already begin with the environment string (plus a colon), it is updated to include this prefix.
4. **Execution Context:**  
   - The function is executed immediately, passing `eventType`, `eventPayload`, and `tagObject` as arguments.
   
### Dependencies
- **Global Objects & Variables:**  
  - The code uses standard global objects such as `document` for updating the page title.
  - It relies on properties set in the event payload (`b`), notably:
    - `b["ut.version"]` (a string representing the full TIQ version).
    - `b.TealiumVersion` (base version information).
    - `b["ut.env"]` (environment information, e.g. "prod").
- **Tealium iQ:**  
  - The extension depends on the Tealium iQ environment and its injection of the event type and payload.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Production Environment
- **Input:**  
  - `b["ut.version"] = "2.13.4"`
  - `b.TealiumVersion = "2.13"`
  - `b["ut.env"] = "prod"`
- **Process:**  
  - Splitting "2.13.4" results in array `["2", "13", "4"]`. The code picks "4".
  - `b.FullTealiumVersion` becomes "2.13/4".
  - Since the environment is "prod", no additional segment is appended and the document title remains unchanged.
- **Result:**  
  - The payload now contains `b.FullTealiumVersion = "2.13/4"`.

### Scenario 2: Non-Production Environment (e.g. Development)
- **Input:**  
  - `b["ut.version"] = "3.5.9"`
  - `b.TealiumVersion = "3.5"`
  - `b["ut.env"] = "dev"`
- **Process:**  
  - Splitting "3.5.9" gives `["3", "5", "9"]`. The resulting version segment is "9".
  - `b.FullTealiumVersion` is formed as "3.5/9".
  - The code then appends the environment "dev" to yield "3.5/9/dev".
  - If the current `document.title` does not already start with "dev: ", it is prepended.
- **Result:**  
  - The payload now includes `b.FullTealiumVersion = "3.5/9/dev"`, and the document title becomes "dev: [Existing Title]".

### Edge Condition: Incorrect or Missing Version Format
- **Input:**  
  - If `b["ut.version"]` is malformatted (e.g. an empty string or missing periods), the `split` method will return an array with a single element.
- **Process & Result:**  
  - Even if the version string is not as expected, the code will still extract the only available segment and append it. However, the resulting `FullTealiumVersion` might be less informative or inaccurate.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Version String Reliance:**  
  - The extension assumes `b["ut.version"]` is a dot-delimited string. If the version string format changes, it may return unexpected results.
  
- **Environment Consistency:**  
  - The logic strictly checks if the environment is "prod". Any misconfiguration in the environment variable (for instance, spelling mistakes) may result in improper appending or document title modification.
  
- **Document Title Modification:**  
  - The extension modifies `document.title` directly. If other scripts also modify the title at runtime, there is potential for conflicts or unexpected title concatenations.
  
- **Extension Order Dependencies:**  
  - If other extensions are intended to modify version-related properties, the order of extension execution in Tealium iQ may affect the final outcome.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Code Modularity:**  
  - Consider refactoring the extension into smaller helper functions to increase readability. For example, create separate functions for version extraction, full version formation, and document title updating.
  
- **Defensive Programming:**  
  - Although availability of `eventType` and `eventPayload` is guaranteed, consider adding minimal checks for the expected format of `b["ut.version"]` to guard against unexpected input.
  
- **Environment Checks:**  
  - Clearly document the supported environment values and consider normalising the environment string (e.g. converting to lower case) before comparison.
  
- **Comment Clarity:**  
  - Expand inline comments to explain the rationale behind key operations. For instance, explain why only the last segment of the version is used.
  
- **Separation of Concerns:**  
  - If possible within your Tealium implementation, separate the concerns of updating version values and modifying the document title into different extensions or functions for improved maintainability.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  - Regularly review the version string format as provided by Tealium and adjust the extension logic if the format changes.
  - Monitor interactions with other extensions, especially those manipulating the document title or version properties, to prevent potential conflicts.
  
- **Ownership:**  
  - Assign a team member to periodically audit this extension’s functionality, especially after major updates to the Tealium iQ platform.
  
- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Create test cases for various environment settings (e.g. "prod", "dev", "qa") to ensure the correct version string is constructed.
  - Verify the document title is updated only when appropriate and that no duplicate prefixes occur.
  - Test edge cases where the version string might not follow the expected format.
  
- **Documentation Updates:**  
  - Keep this documentation up-to-date with changes in code or requirements.
  - Provide versioning for the extension documentation to track improvements and fixes over time.

This documentation should serve as a comprehensive guide for developers and stakeholders to understand, use, maintain, and potentially refactor the extension effectively.
