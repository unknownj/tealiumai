# Extension Documentation: WTA : Passthrough Parameters

This document provides a comprehensive guide for the Tealium iQ extension "WTA : Passthrough Parameters". It covers an overview, code explanation, usage examples, known limitations, recommendations for refactoring, and maintenance notes. The document is written in British English and adheres to GitHub Flavoured Markdown.

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** WTA : Passthrough Parameters  
- **ID:** 1090  
- **Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** 894  
- **Execution Frequency:** The extension executes for every payload event processed by Tealium iQ (typically invoked on each call where a Universal Data Object (UDO) exists)

### Summary

This extension scans the event payload for any parameter names that begin with the prefix "WTP:". For every such parameter found, it removes the "WTP:" prefix and maps the remaining string to the original parameter name in the tag object's mapping. This enables dynamic passthrough of UDO elements as tracking parameters, ensuring that any element tagged with the "WTP:" prefix is automatically converted into its corresponding parameter key in the final analytics payload.

---

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables

- **a (eventType):** Represents the type of the event being processed (e.g. link, view, etc.).  
- **b (eventPayload):** The payload object containing UDO elements sent in the event.  
- **u (tagObject):** The object representing the tag configuration; includes a property (`map`) where the resulting parameter mappings are stored.

### Logic Flow

1. **Immediate Function Invocation:**  
   The extension utilises an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) to encapsulate its logic and prevent contaminating the global scope.

2. **Iteration through Payload Keys:**  
   - The `for...in` loop iterates over all keys in the `eventPayload` object.
   - For every key found in the payload, the code checks if it begins with the prefix "WTP:" using `indexOf("WTP:") === 0`.

3. **Mapping Logic:**  
   - If a key meets the condition (i.e. it starts with "WTP:"), the extension maps this key to a new value in `tagObject.map`.  
   - The new value is derived by removing the first four characters ("WTP:") from the original key using `substr(4)`.

### Dependencies

- **Global Objects:**  
  The code relies on the existence and validity of `eventType` (as a string), `eventPayload` (as an object), and `tagObject` (which contains a `map` property). These objects are provided by the Tealium iQ environment and are guaranteed to be present.
  
- **Library Dependency:**  
  While the extension is assigned to the "lib-main-analytics" library context, it does not directly depend on any external libraries or additional global objects apart from those guaranteed by Tealium iQ.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Example 1: Normal Condition

**Scenario:** A page view event has a UDO containing a passthrough parameter.  

**Input:**

```javascript
utag.link({
  "WTP:WT.ti": "This is a page title",
  "otherKey": "Another value"
});
```

**Behaviour:**  
- The extension will detect that "WTP:WT.ti" starts with "WTP:".
- It then maps the parameter such that the key "WTP:WT.ti" in `tagObject.map` will get the value "WT.ti".
- The "otherKey" parameter is ignored as it does not start with "WTP:".

### Example 2: Multiple Parameters

**Scenario:** Multiple UDO elements contain the "WTP:" prefix.

**Input:**

```javascript
utag.link({
  "WTP:WT.c": "Campaign Value",
  "WTP:WT.a": "Author Value",
  "someOtherParam": "Value"
});
```

**Behaviour:**  
- The extension maps "WTP:WT.c" to "WT.c" and "WTP:WT.a" to "WT.a" in the `tagObject.map` object.
- The parameter "someOtherParam" remains unaffected.

### Example 3: Edge Condition

**Scenario:** No UDO elements with the "WTP:" prefix are present in the payload.

**Input:**

```javascript
utag.link({
  "nonWTPParam": "Some value"
});
```

**Behaviour:**  
- The extension iterates over the payload, but no key matches the condition.
- As a result, the `tagObject.map` remains unchanged for passthrough parameters.

---

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Strict prefix matching:**  
  The code only checks for keys starting with exactly "WTP:". If there is any variation (such as "wtp:" or additional whitespace), the extension will not process those keys as intended.

- **Overwriting Behaviour:**  
  If multiple parameters with the "WTP:" prefix resolve to the same post-prefix value, the later mapping will overwrite the earlier one in `tagObject.map`.

- **Global Dependency Assumption:**  
  The extension assumes that `eventType`, `eventPayload`, and `tagObject.map` are always available and correctly initialised in the environment. Any external manipulation of these objects before extension execution might result in unexpected behaviour.

- **Conflict with Other Extensions:**  
  If another extension or script manipulates the same keys (or the same `tagObject.map` property), it could lead to conflicts or unintended overrides.

---

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Enhanced Validation:**  
  Even though the properties (`eventType`, `eventPayload`, `tagObject.map`) are guaranteed to be present, consider adding checks (where appropriate) for cleaner error handling during development or debugging.

- **Modularisation:**  
  If the project grows, consider separating the mapping logic into a dedicated function. This will aid in testing and improve readability.

- **Code Comments:**  
  Maintain inline comments that describe the purpose of each major block, as these help future developers to quickly understand the logic.

- **Defensive Coding Best Practices:**  
  Although defensive coding for the existence of `eventType`, `eventPayload`, and `tagObject` is not needed as per the specifications, similar checks for future extensions might be useful to avoid runtime errors.

- **Documentation Maintenance:**  
  Ensure the documentation is updated whenever the logic or scope of the extension is modified.

*Note:* Since we are required to support ES5, it is important to avoid ES6+ syntax such as arrow functions, template literals, or block-scoped declarations like let/const.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  - Regularly review the mapping logic especially when updating related tracking parameters.  
  - Monitor the Tealium iQ configuration to ensure that changes in eventPayload format do not lead to unforeseen issues.

- **Ownership:**  
  - Clearly document the repository or location containing the source code for this extension.
  - Assign primary contacts for future changes or reviews.

- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Unit tests could be written to emulate different input payloads and verify that `tagObject.map` is populated as expected.  
  - Integration testing in a staging environment can help ensure compatibility with other Tealium extensions and the overall tracking implementation.

- **Version Control:**  
  - Use version control best practices to document changes over time.  
  - Tag releases of the extension code to align with milestones in your analytics implementation.

- **Future Enhancements:**  
  - Consider incorporating more flexible mapping rules if additional prefixes or variable mapping patterns become necessary.  
  - Document any integration dependencies with new libraries or global objects carefully.
