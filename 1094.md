# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: WTA : TAG : SET : Retract Transaction Details

## 1. Extension Overview
- **Name**: WTA : TAG : SET : Retract Transaction Details
- **ID**: 1100
- **Type**: Advanced Javascript Code
- **Scope**: 894
- **Execution Frequency**: Active

**Summary**:  
This extension modifies the `JourneyStep` attribute in the `eventPayload` if the current `JourneyName` matches specific criteria ("ApplyCCC" or "ApplyCreditCard"). It ensures that the `JourneyStep` reflects the latest value available in the global `utag_data`. This is essential for maintaining accurate tracking of a user's progression through a journey that requires transaction details, particularly within credit card applications.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables:
- `eventType`: A string representing the type of the event being processed.
- `eventPayload`: An object containing details related to the event, specifically including `JourneyName` and `JourneyStep`.
- `tagObject`: An object that holds additional context for the handling of the extension.

### Logic Flow:
1. **Anonymous Function Wrapping**: The entire code is wrapped within an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) to create a local scope and avoid polluting the global namespace.
2. **Journey Name Check**: The code checks if `JourneyName` is either "ApplyCCC" or "ApplyCreditCard".
3. **Conditional Logic for Handling Journey Step**:
   - If `window.utag_data` is available and has a `JourneyStep` that is different from the one in `eventPayload`, then `JourneyStep` in `eventPayload` is updated to match that of `window.utag_data`.

### Dependencies:
- **Global Objects**: The extension depends on the presence of `window.utag_data` which must contain the `JourneyStep` attribute. It operates under the assumption that these attributes are correctly populated by the Tealium library and configuration.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Scenario:
- **Flow**: 
  - User navigates through the application and reaches a stage where `JourneyName` is "ApplyCCC".
  - `window.utag_data.JourneyStep` is set to "Step 2".
  - The extension updates `eventPayload.JourneyStep` to "Step 2".

### Edge Conditions:
1. **Matching Journey Names but Identical JourneySteps**:
   - If `eventPayload.JourneyStep` is already "Step 2", no changes occur and the extension exits.
   
2. **Missing JourneyStep in utag_data**:
   - If `window.utag_data.JourneyStep` is undefined or null but the journey name matches, the extension does not update `eventPayload.JourneyStep`.

3. **Unexpected Journey Name**:
   - If `JourneyName` is neither "ApplyCCC" nor "ApplyCreditCard", the extension performs no action.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas
- The extension relies heavily on the `utag_data` global object. If this object is modified or not populated correctly before the extension runs, behaviour may be unpredictable.
- Conflicts may arise if other extensions or scripts alter the `JourneyStep` simultaneously.
- If multiple extensions are triggered for the same event type, the execution order can affect the resultant state of `eventPayload`.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring
- **Improve Readability**: Consider breaking the logic into smaller, named functions for clarity. For example, a function like `updateJourneyStep()` could encapsulate the update logic.
- **Additional Logging**: Implement logging features that could aid in troubleshooting whenever modifications to `eventPayload` occur.
- **Return Values**: Although the extension does not currently return values, adding a return statement could help in debugging by providing feedback on changes made to `eventPayload`.
- Ensure consistent code style, especially with indentation and spacing, to improve maintainability.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes
- **Ownership**: Designate a specific developer or team responsible for ongoing monitoring of this extension's performance.
- **Testing Guidelines**: Establish tests that simulate various scenarios (including edge cases) to confirm correct behaviour.
- **Continuation of Updates**: Periodic reviews of the code should be conducted, especially after updates to the underlying Tealium libraries or changes in data structure to remain in sync with the overall analytics strategy.

Documentation like this will ensure continuity and clarity for any developers who interact with this extension in the future.
