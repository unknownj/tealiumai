# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** ApplyCCC utag_data/datalayer reconciliation  
- **ID:** 1094  
- **Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** Before Load Rules  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Always  

**Summary:**  
This extension is designed to reconcile the JourneyStep data between the global data layer (accessible via `window.utag_data`) and the event payload (`eventPayload`). It specifically targets journeys whose name is either "ApplyCCC" or "ApplyCreditCard". When a discrepancy is identified between the JourneyStep value in the global data layer and that in the event payload, the extension updates the event payload with the newer value from the global layer. This ensures consistency of the JourneyStep data across different parts of the application.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables and Objects

- **eventType:**  
  The first argument passed to the function (typically a string) representing the type of event occurring.

- **eventPayload (referred to as “b” in the code):**  
  An object containing data specific to the current event. It includes properties such as `JourneyName` and `JourneyStep`.

- **window.utag_data:**  
  A global object (if present) that holds the data layer values. It is checked for the property `JourneyStep` to ensure consistency.

### Flow of Logic

1. **Check the Journey Name:**  
   The code first inspects `eventPayload.JourneyName` (alias: b.JourneyName). The condition is met if this value equals either "ApplyCCC" or "ApplyCreditCard".  
   ```javascript
   if(b.JourneyName === "ApplyCCC" || b.JourneyName == "ApplyCreditCard"){
   ```

2. **Reconciliation of JourneyStep:**  
   If the global `window.utag_data` is defined and it contains a valid `JourneyStep` value, the code checks to see if the value is different from `eventPayload.JourneyStep`.  
   ```javascript
   if(window.utag_data && window.utag_data.JourneyStep && window.utag_data.JourneyStep != b.JourneyStep){
       b.JourneyStep = window.utag_data.JourneyStep;
   }
   ```
   This update ensures that if there is a discrepancy between the two sources for the JourneyStep, the eventPayload is updated to reflect the correct or latest step.

3. **Commented Out Code:**  
   There is a commented-out line referring to `window.clova3.datalayer.set(utag_data,true);` which indicates that there may have been an intention to synchronise or further process the data layer. However, this line is deemed "too risky" to execute in its current context, and hence it remains inactive.

### Dependencies

- **Global Objects:**  
  - `window.utag_data`: The code depends on this object for the updated JourneyStep.
  - `eventType` and `eventPayload`: These are guaranteed to be present in the current execution environment as per the extension's prerequisites.

- **Tealium Environment:**  
  The extension assumes that the Tealium framework passes the correct variables (`eventType` and `eventPayload`) and that these have the expected structure.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Usage Scenario

**Case: Consistent Journey Naming with Updated JourneyStep**

- **Input:**  
  - `eventPayload.JourneyName` = "ApplyCCC"  
  - `eventPayload.JourneyStep` = "step1"  
  - `window.utag_data.JourneyStep` = "step2"

- **Processing:**  
  The extension verifies that the JourneyName is valid. Then, it detects that `window.utag_data.JourneyStep` ("step2") differs from `eventPayload.JourneyStep` ("step1") and updates the eventPayload to use "step2".

- **Output:**  
  - `eventPayload.JourneyStep` becomes "step2".

### Edge Condition Example

**Case: JourneyName Not Matching the Criteria**

- **Input:**  
  - `eventPayload.JourneyName` = "ApplyLoan"  
  - `eventPayload.JourneyStep` = "step1"  
  - `window.utag_data.JourneyStep` = "step2"

- **Processing:**  
  Since JourneyName is not "ApplyCCC" or "ApplyCreditCard", the condition fails immediately.  
- **Output:**  
  No changes are made to `eventPayload`.

### Edge Condition Example (Global Object Absence)

**Case: Global Data Layer Not Available**

- **Input:**  
  - `eventPayload.JourneyName` = "ApplyCCC"  
  - `eventPayload.JourneyStep` = "step1"  
  - `window.utag_data` is undefined

- **Processing:**  
  The code first checks for the existence of `window.utag_data` and does not proceed with the JourneyStep update.
- **Output:**  
  `eventPayload.JourneyStep` remains "step1".

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Dependency on Global Data:**  
  This extension relies on `window.utag_data` being present and in the expected format. If this object is missing or misconfigured, the reconciliation process will not take place.

- **Timing Considerations:**  
  Since the extension runs "Before Load Rules", if the global `utag_data` is not yet updated at that point in the load sequence, the updated JourneyStep might not be applied correctly.

- **Potential Conflicts:**  
  - If multiple extensions modify `JourneyStep` simultaneously, it may lead to data inconsistency.
  - The commented-out code snippet (`window.clova3.datalayer.set(utag_data,true)`) suggests that earlier versions attempted additional processing that was later rejected for risk, meaning careful consideration should be taken if extending functionality further.

- **Hardcoded Journey Names:**  
  The conditions check for specific string literals ("ApplyCCC" and "ApplyCreditCard"). This might necessitate modification should the naming convention change in the future.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks:**  
  Although the availability of `eventType` and `eventPayload` is guaranteed, consider adding checks for nested properties—only if necessary within the constraints of ES5. For example, ensure that `window.utag_data.JourneyStep` exists before attempting the comparison.

- **Modularisation:**  
  If the extension grows in complexity, consider refactoring the condition checks and data reconciliation logic into separate functions. This aids readability and future maintenance.

- **Comments:**  
  Expand inline comments to describe why certain decisions were made (e.g. why the `clova3` integration was deemed "too risky") so that future maintainers understand the historical context.

- **Code Consistency:**  
  Maintain a consistent approach when comparing string values (using strict equality `===` where appropriate) to avoid unintended type coercions.

- **Configuration:**  
  If the conditions (i.e. JourneyName values) are likely to change in the future, consider externalising these values to a configuration object to avoid hardcoding within the logic.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Testing:**  
  Ensure that any changes to the global data layer or Tealium load rules are accompanied by tests verifying that the correct JourneyStep is being applied under all expected scenarios.

- **Owner and Versioning:**  
  - Assign a clear owner or team responsible for the extension's upkeep.  
  - Maintain version control (e.g. Git) and include detailed commit messages when adjustments are made.

- **Documentation Updates:**  
  Always update this documentation alongside any code changes to avoid mismatches between implementation and documentation.

- **Review Dependencies:**  
  Periodically review the dependencies on `window.utag_data` and other external scripts. Should there be changes in the global data layer architecture, update the extension accordingly.

- **Risk Management:**  
  Any consideration to re-enable or modify the commented-out `clova3` line should include a thorough risk assessment, including cross-team consultation with data layer and analytics stakeholders.
