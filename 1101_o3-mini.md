# Emergency Overdrafts Fix Extension Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive overview and detailed explanation of the Tealium iQ "Emergency Overdrafts Fix" extension. It covers the extension's purpose, code flow, usage scenarios, limitations, refactoring recommendations, and maintenance guidelines.

---

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Emergency Overdrafts Fix  
- **ID:** 1101  
- **Type:** Advanced Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** 894  
- **Execution Frequency:** Runs on page load for pages with a pathname that includes “/applyod/” and when the JourneyVersion equals "1".

**Summary:**  
This extension handles specific data modifications for overdraft journey events on pages under the “/applyod/” path. It ensures that key journey properties (e.g. JourneyName, JourneyAction, JourneyStep, JourneyProduct, etc.) are set to standard values under certain conditions. The purpose of the extension is to “fix” or normalise event payload data for overdraft-related actions to improve data consistency for downstream analytics and tag firing.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables and Parameters

- **a (eventType):**  
  Represents the event type. In this extension, it is not manipulated but passed to the function signature.

- **b (eventPayload):**  
  Contains all the event data that is manipulated by the extension. Properties such as JourneyVersion, JourneyName, JourneyAction, etc., are expected to be present on this object.

- **u (tagObject):**  
  Represents additional tag information. This parameter is not directly used within the code logic.

### Logic Flow

1. **Page Path and Journey Version Check:**
   - The code checks whether the current `window.location.pathname` includes “/applyod/”. This ensures the extension only runs on relevant pages.
   - It then checks if `b.JourneyVersion` is either not set (defaulting to "1") or explicitly equals "1". If so, further modifications are applied.

2. **Setting the Journey Name:**
   - `b.JourneyName` is set to "ApplyOD" to standardise the journey identifier.

3. **Handling Specific Journey Actions:**
   - If `b.JourneyAction` equals "pca manage overdrafts", then it is cleared (set to an empty string).

4. **Initial Journey Step Setting:**
   - If `b.JourneyStep` is exactly 0, it is updated to 1, implying the journey has started.

5. **Mapping Action Narrative to Product:**
   - The value in `b.JourneyActionNarrative` is reassigned to `b.JourneyProduct`, and `b.JourneyActionNarrative` is then cleared.

6. **Extracting Journey Amount:**
   - The code checks if `b.JourneyAction` begins with the monetary symbol (£). This is determined by comparing the first character’s Unicode value (163).
   - If true, it extracts the substring from the second character onward and assigns it to `b.JourneyAmount`. It then clears `b.JourneyAction`.

7. **Handling Specific Journey Step Names:**
   - For `b.JourneyStepName` equals "Overdraft downsell":
     - Sets `b.JourneyStep` to 3.
     - Sets `b.JourneyAction` to "Downsell".
   - For `b.JourneyStepName` equals "Overdraft declined":
     - Sets `b.JourneyStep` to 3.
     - Sets `b.JourneyAction` to "Credit Decline".
   - For `b.JourneyStepName` equals "Overdraft referred":
     - Sets `b.JourneyStep` to 3.
     - Sets `b.JourneyAction` to "Referred to Branch".
   - For `b.JourneyStepName` equals "Success Page":
     - Sets `b.JourneyAction` to "Service Action Complete", indicating completion of the service action.

### Dependencies on Global Objects/Libraries

- **window.location.pathname:**  
  Used to verify the current page URL path.

- **eventType, eventPayload, tagObject:**  
  These parameters are provided by Tealium iQ and are essential for the operation of the extension.

- **Assumptions:**  
  The code assumes that the payload object (eventPayload, represented by variable "b") includes properties like JourneyVersion, JourneyAction, JourneyStep, JourneyActionNarrative, JourneyStepName, etc.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Example Scenario 1: Normal Overdraft Journey on /applyod/ Page

- **Input Data:**
  - URL: `https://example.com/applyod/somepage`
  - eventPayload contains:
    - JourneyVersion: "1"
    - JourneyAction: "pca manage overdrafts"
    - JourneyStep: 0
    - JourneyActionNarrative: "Overdraft Product A"
    - JourneyStepName: Undefined

- **Processing:**
  - Since the URL path contains “/applyod/” and JourneyVersion equals "1":
    - `b.JourneyName` is set to "ApplyOD".
    - `b.JourneyAction` (being "pca manage overdrafts") is cleared.
    - `b.JourneyStep` (initially 0) is set to 1.
    - `b.JourneyProduct` receives the value "Overdraft Product A" from JourneyActionNarrative.
    - `b.JourneyActionNarrative` is cleared.
  
- **Resulting Payload:**
  - JourneyName: "ApplyOD"
  - JourneyAction: ""
  - JourneyStep: 1
  - JourneyProduct: "Overdraft Product A"
  - JourneyActionNarrative: ""

### Example Scenario 2: Overdraft Action with Monetary Value

- **Input Data:**
  - URL: `https://example.com/applyod/overview`
  - eventPayload contains:
    - JourneyVersion: "1"
    - JourneyAction: "£200"
    - JourneyStep: 1

- **Processing:**
  - The extension checks and finds that the first character of JourneyAction has a char code of 163 (corresponding to £). It extracts the substring "200" and assigns it to `b.JourneyAmount`.
  - It then clears `b.JourneyAction`.

- **Resulting Payload:**
  - JourneyAmount: "200"
  - JourneyAction: ""

### Example Scenario 3: Specific Journey Step Names

- **Input Data:**
  - URL: `https://example.com/applyod/confirmation`
  - eventPayload contains:
    - JourneyVersion: "1"
    - JourneyStepName: "Overdraft downsell"

- **Processing:**
  - For "Overdraft downsell":
    - `b.JourneyStep` is set to 3.
    - `b.JourneyAction` is set to "Downsell".

- **Resulting Payload:**
  - JourneyStep: 3
  - JourneyAction: "Downsell"

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Strict URL Matching:**  
  The extension only executes its logic if the URL contains “/applyod/”. Any changes to URL structure may prevent the code from running.

- **JourneyVersion Handling:**  
  The extension only processes payloads matching JourneyVersion "1". Future versions may not be handled unless additional conditions are added.

- **Assumption on Data Presence:**  
  There is an assumption that certain properties (e.g. JourneyAction, JourneyStepName) exist within eventPayload. In the absence of these, unexpected behaviour might occur.

- **Overwriting of Values:**  
  The code unconditionally overwrites some properties (e.g. JourneyName, JourneyActionNarrative) which might conflict with other Tealium extensions or external scripts that also modify these fields.

- **Non-Defensive Coding:**  
  The extension does not perform additional type checking or null checks (beyond the mandatory parameters) on properties in the payload, which could lead to runtime issues if unexpected data is present.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Use of Constants:**  
  Define constants for repetitive string values such as “/applyod/”, "JourneyVersion", "Overdraft downsell", "Overdraft declined", etc. This would improve maintainability and reduce the risk of typos.

- **Modularise Code Blocks:**  
  Consider refactoring the different processing blocks (e.g. handling monetary values, checking journey step names) into separate helper functions. This will make the code more organised and easier to test.

- **Enhanced Commenting:**  
  Add detailed inline comments explaining the purpose of each conditional block. This aids future developers in understanding the business logic.

- **Error Handling:**  
  Although defensive coding for eventType and eventPayload availability is not required, consider adding checks for the existence and types of specific payload properties if the data source could ever be modified by other scripts.

- **Maintain ES5 Compatibility:**  
  Continue using ES5 syntax, avoiding ES6 features such as arrow functions, template literals, and let/const declarations, to ensure compatibility with our existing environment.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Testing:**  
  Regularly test the extension against various journey scenarios (both normal and edge cases) to ensure that the expected modifications are applied correctly. Automated tests can help verify that future changes do not break the intended functionality.

- **Versioning and Ownership:**  
  Maintain version control records for the extension code. Include comments with version numbers and maintenance dates within the code. Clearly assign responsibility for this extension to a specific team or developer to streamline issue resolution and future enhancements.

- **Documentation Updates:**  
  Any modifications or refactoring should be reflected immediately in this documentation. Stakeholders and developers should be kept informed of any logic changes, especially those that impact data collection and reporting.

- **Cross-Extension Dependencies:**  
  Review other Tealium iQ extensions that handle similar journey data to ensure there aren’t conflicts. Establish a clear strategy regarding the order of execution if multiple extensions modify the same eventPayload properties.

- **Integration Considerations:**  
  If the extension’s logic is later required to support additional journey versions or pages other than those containing “/applyod/”, plan for module updates while preserving backwards compatibility with ES5.
