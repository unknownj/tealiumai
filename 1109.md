# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: GAN MBNA - CG Lookup

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name**: GAN MBNA: CG lookup
- **ID**: 1116
- **Type**: Lookup Table
- **Scope**: 920
- **Execution Frequency**: Event-based

### Summary
The GAN MBNA: CG Lookup extension is designed to increment an event counter in the `window.utag` object each time this extension is executed. If the counter exceeds 200, further execution is halted. This ensures that excessive event processing does not occur, potentially preventing performance degradation or unintended behaviours. The extension operates within the context of event-driven data flow, where it can track and limit event handling efficiently.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- **`window.utag.eventCounter`**: This variable is created or incremented to keep track of the number of events processed since the script's load. It defaults to 0 if it has not been previously set.
- **`eventType`**: Represents the type of event being processed. This is provided as a parameter to the function.
- **`eventPayload`**: Represents additional data associated with the event. This is provided as a parameter to the function.
- **`tagObject`**: Represents the current state of the Tealium tag management system. This is provided as a parameter to the function.

### Logic Flow
1. The code begins execution when an event occurs, triggering the function.
2. The `eventCounter` is incremented by 1 with each execution of the function.
3. A check is performed to see if the `eventCounter` has exceeded 200.
   - If it has, the function returns `false`, preventing further processing.
   - If it has not exceeded 200, the function completes normally.

### Dependencies
- This extension relies on the global object `window.utag`, which is part of the Tealium ecosystem.
- It does not have dependencies on external libraries; it only uses standard JavaScript functionality.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Scenario
- **Condition**: A user triggers an event that is being tracked, for example, a click on a product link.
- **Flow**: 
  - The event occurs.
  - The extension executes.
  - The event counter increases by 1 (e.g., from 5 to 6).
  - The event continues to be processed normally.

### Edge Condition Scenario
- **Condition**: The eventCounter reaches 200 after consecutive events.
- **Flow**: 
  - The event occurs, and the extension executes.
  - The `eventCounter` is incremented to 201.
  - The function detects that it has exceeded 200, returning `false`.
  - Further processing for additional events is halted.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Event Limitation**: The counter limits the processing of events to 200. Any events triggered beyond this limit will not be processed, which may affect event tracking and analytics.
- **State Management**: If the page is refreshed or the extension is reloaded, the `eventCounter` resets to 0. This behaviour may lead to inconsistent counts across page loads.
- **Interaction with Other Extensions**: If another extension alters the global `utag.eventCounter`, unexpected behaviours could arise, particularly if that extension also depends on it.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks**: Although the requirements state not to worry about the availability of `eventType` or `eventPayload`, adding checks for `window.utag` to ensure it is defined before manipulation would be beneficial.
- **Code Style**: Ensure consistent formatting and comments for clarity. Adding comments to complex logic could aid future developers.
- **Modularization**: Consider organising the code into smaller functions if additional logic is added in the future, promoting reusability and maintainability.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Introduce logs to monitor the event count dynamically, which could provide insights and facilitate debugging.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ownership**: Designate a specific team member responsible for maintaining this extension. Documentation and code changes should be logged comprehensively.
- **Testing Guidelines**: Implement unit tests to verify the functionality of the event counter mechanism, focusing on scenarios like exceeding the count threshold.
- **Code Reviews**: Regular reviews should be conducted when changes are made to ensure adherence to the coding standards and effective performance monitoring.
