# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive overview, explanation, examples, limitations, and recommendations for the "Disable Webtrends tag after 200 events per page" extension currently implemented in Tealium iQ.

---

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Disable Webtrends tag after 200 events per page  
- **ID:** 1109  
- **Extension Type:** Advanced Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** 894  
- **Execution Frequency:** The code is executed on every event trigger.

**Summary:**  
This extension is designed to disable (or short-circuit) the execution of the Webtrends tag after a page has processed more than 200 events. The primary purpose is to limit excessive events from triggering the tag, potentially reducing overhead on the analytics platform and preventing data overload.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables and Global Dependencies

- **window.utag.eventCounter:**  
  This global variable (attached to the `window.utag` namespace) is used to count the number of events that have occurred on a page. It is incremented each time the extension is executed.

- **eventType, eventPayload, tagObject:**  
  These parameters are passed into the custom function. While not utilised within the current extension code, they represent the event name (string), event data (object), and the tag context object respectively. Their presence is guaranteed.

### Logic Flow

1. **Initial Counter Increment:**  
   The extension begins by reading the current value of `window.utag.eventCounter`, defaulting to 0 if it is undefined. It then increments this counter by one.

2. **Conditional Check:**  
   The incremented counter is then evaluated. If the counter exceeds 200, the function returns `false`.

   - **Impact of Returning false:**  
     In the context of Tealium iQ extensions, returning `false` typically signals that the tag processing should be stopped or not further executed, effectively disabling the Webtrends tag beyond the set threshold.

3. **Normal Execution:**  
   If the counter is 200 or less, the function does not return `false` and therefore allows the normal processing of the tag.

### Dependencies

- **Global object window.utag:**  
As the extension uses `window.utag.eventCounter` for counting events, it depends on the existence of the global `utag` object. This object is standard in Tealium deployments and must be available for the counter logic to work correctly.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Operation Scenario

- **Scenario:** A page load triggers events sequentially.
  
  - *Execution:*  
    1. For events 1 to 200, each event is counted, the counter is incremented, and the tag executes normally.
    2. The extension does not block the tag execution as the counter remains ≤200.
  
  - *Outcome:*  
    The Webtrends tag processes all events normally.

### Edge Condition: Exceeding the Threshold

- **Scenario:** A page experiences a high number of events (e.g. 201+ events).
  
  - *Execution:*  
    1. The counter reaches 200 through normal event processing.
    2. When the event counter increments to 201, the condition `if(window.utag.eventCounter > 200)` evaluates to true.
    3. The function returns `false`, effectively disabling further tag processing.
  
  - *Outcome:*  
    The Webtrends tag is disabled from processing events beyond the threshold, potentially reducing redundant data tracking.

### Alternative Data Flow Scenario

- **Scenario:** Testing or debugging the extension’s counting mechanism.
  
  - *Execution:*  
    1. Developers can simulate events by manually invoking the extension function (with dummy values for eventType, eventPayload, and tagObject).
    2. The counter increment and conditional check can be verified by observing whether the function returns `false` after the 200th event.
  
  - *Outcome:*  
    Confirm the behaviour of the extension under controlled test scenarios.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Global Variable Dependency:**  
  Relying on `window.utag.eventCounter` means that:
  - If another extension or external script inadvertently resets or modifies `window.utag.eventCounter`, the event counting logic may be inaccurate.
  
- **Tag Interference:**  
  Should other Tealium iQ extensions also use `window.utag.eventCounter` for different purposes:
  - Conflicts might occur, potentially leading to premature disabling or failure to disable the Webtrends tag.
  
- **Lack of Customisation:**  
  The event threshold (200) is hardcoded:
  - If business requirements change, the value must be manually updated in the extension code.

- **No Detailed Logging:**  
  The extension lacks logging functionality:
  - In cases of debugging, there is no record of when the counter is incremented or when the tag disabling logic is triggered.

---

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks:**  
  Although eventType and eventPayload are guaranteed, consider verifying the existence of `window.utag` before accessing `eventCounter`:
  - This can help avoid unexpected errors if the global object is misconfigured by some other script.
  
- **Configurability:**  
  Make the threshold value configurable rather than hardcoded:
  - This could be achieved by storing the threshold in a property within the extension or a configuration object, allowing easier adjustments without modifying the core logic.
  
- **Separation of Concerns:**  
  Consider modularising the code:
  - Isolate the counting logic in a separate function. This makes it more maintainable and easier to test.

- **Error Handling:**  
  While not critical for this simple extension, adding basic error handling or notifications (e.g. console warnings) when unusual behaviour is detected may assist in long-term maintenance.

- **Comments:**  
  Enhance the inline documentation and comments to clarify the purpose and flow of code logic:
  - This assists other developers in understanding and modifying the extension in the future.

*Note: All recommended refactoring should be done in compliance with ES5, avoiding ES2015/ES6 constructs such as arrow functions, template literals, `let`/`const`, etc.*

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  - Regularly review the extension to ensure that it continues to meet business requirements, especially if event volumes change.
  - Verify that no new extensions interfere with the global `window.utag.eventCounter` variable.

- **Ownership & Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Assign ownership of the extension to a specific team member or group to handle updates and address issues.
  - Develop unit tests that simulate varying event counts to confirm that:
    - The counter increments correctly.
    - The tag is appropriately disabled after 200 events.
  
- **Documentation Updates:**  
  - Keep the documentation updated with any changes to the logic or configuration options.
  - Incorporate user feedback from debugging sessions or from stakeholders when issues arise.

- **Integration Testing:**  
  - Conduct integration testing within the full Tealium iQ environment to see how the extension interacts with other tags and extensions.
  - Monitor production performance and error logs for any anomalous behaviour.
