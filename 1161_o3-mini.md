# Legacy Event Support for Tablet in Branch Documentation

This document provides a detailed overview and explanation of the Tealium iQ extension named “Legacy Event Support for Tablet in Branch”. It covers the extension’s purpose, internal workings, usage scenarios, limitations, suggested improvements, and maintenance guidelines.

---

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Legacy Event Support for Tablet in Branch  
- **ID:** 1161  
- **Extension ID:** 100040  
- **Type:** Advanced Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** DOM Ready  
- **Occurrence:** Run Once  

**Summary:**  
This extension is designed to process legacy event data by parsing a query string input, mapping its parameters according to a predefined configuration (located at `utag.sender[894].map`), and then sending the appropriately formatted payload to the Tealium tag management system via `utag.view()`. It supports legacy events on tablet devices in a specified branch by ensuring that the expected data format is maintained.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables & Logic Flow

- **Function Definition:**  
  The primary function, `utag.legacy_event`, accepts a single argument `qs` (query string).

- **Mapping Retrieval & Remapping:**  
  1. The code retrieves a mapping object from `utag.sender[894].map` (stored in variable `m`), which presumably contains key-value pairs where the values are comma-separated strings.
  2. A new object `remap` is created. The code iterates over each key in `m`:
     - Splits each comma-separated value (e.g. `"param1,param2"`) into an array.
     - Assigns each individual element as a key in `remap` with the original key as its value.
     - This reverse mapping allows the extension to translate incoming query string keys to a desired parameter name.

- **Query String Processing:**  
  1. The input query string (`qs`) is processed by first removing any "?" characters and then splitting by the "&" character into an array `qsparts`. Each element is expected to be in the form “key=value”.
  2. For each element in `qsparts`:
     - The parameter name (`p`) is obtained by splitting the string at the "=" and taking the first part.
     - The parameter value (`v`) is obtained similarly using the second part.
     - The code then checks if there is an entry for `p` in the `remap` object. If so, it uses the mapped key; otherwise, it keeps it unchanged.
     - These keys and values are added to a new object `payload`.

- **Data Dispatch:**  
  Once the payload has been built, the function calls `utag.view(payload)`, effectively sending the processed data for further handling within the Tealium environment.

### Dependencies on Global Objects

- **Global `utag` Object:**  
  The function assumes that the global `utag` object exists and is accessible.
  
- **Mapping Data from `utag.sender`:**  
  The extension accesses `utag.sender[894].map` for the mapping configuration. It is critical that this object is available and correctly formatted.

- **Function `utag.view()`:**  
  The processed payload is submitted via this global function, which is part of Tealium’s event handling infrastructure.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Example 1: Standard Query String with Mapped Parameters

- **Input:**  
  Query string: "promo=SUMMER&ref=12345"  
  Assume `utag.sender[894].map` contains:  
  {  
  "campaign": "promo,advert",  
  "reference": "ref,id"  
  }

- **Process:**  
  - The mapping operation creates a reverse mapping:  
    - "promo" → "campaign"  
    - "advert" → "campaign"  
    - "ref" → "reference"  
    - "id" → "reference"  
  - For each key in the query string:  
    - "promo" is found in `remap` and is replaced with "campaign".  
    - "ref" is found in `remap` and is replaced with "reference".  
  - The final payload will be:  
    {  
  "campaign": "SUMMER",  
  "reference": "12345"  
  }

- **Outcome:**  
  The payload is passed to `utag.view()`, ensuring the event is tracked with the correct keys.

### Example 2: Query String with Unmapped Parameter

- **Input:**  
  Query string: "source=google&ref=67890"  
  Assume the same mapping as above applies.

- **Process:**  
  - "ref" is mapped to "reference".  
  - "source" does not exist in `remap`, so it remains unchanged.
  - Final payload:  
    {  
  "source": "google",  
  "reference": "67890"  
  }

- **Outcome:**  
  The resulting payload, containing both mapped and unmapped keys, is sent via `utag.view()`.

### Edge Conditions

- **Edge Case:**  
  If the input query string is empty or lacks the expected structure (missing "=" or "&"), the function may produce an incomplete or empty payload. Similarly, if `utag.sender[894].map` is not defined as expected, the mapping will not occur correctly.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Global Object Checks:**  
  - The code includes a check (`if(!window.utag)`) that does not have a corresponding code block. This might indicate an incomplete defensive measure.  
  - The extension assumes `utag` exists and that `utag.sender[894].map` is valid. If these assumptions fail, the function may throw errors or not execute as intended.

- **Query String Parsing Method:**  
  - The logic for splitting the query string is simplistic and may fail if parameter values contain characters such as "=" or "&" as part of URL-encoded data.

- **Error Handling:**  
  - There is no explicit error handling if the query string format is unexpected or if any of the mapping operations fail.

- **Potential Conflicts:**  
  - As this extension modifies the global `utag` namespace by adding `utag.legacy_event`, it might conflict with other extensions or custom scripts that manipulate `utag`.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Coding Enhancements:**  
  - Improve the check for the existence of the `utag` object. For example, encapsulate subsequent code in a block that only executes if `window.utag` is defined.
  - Consider verifying that `utag.sender[894]` and `utag.sender[894].map` are correctly defined before attempting to access or iterate over them.

- **Code Clarity and Modularity:**  
  - Add inline comments to explain the purpose of each major block of code.
  - Modularise parts of the code, such as splitting the mapping logic into its own helper function, to improve readability and testability.
  
- **Handling Complex Query Strings:**  
  - Enhance the parsing logic to properly handle URL-encoded values, especially where the parameter values may include special characters.

- **Error and Edge Case Management:**  
  - While defensive coding for `eventType` or `eventPayload` is not required, consider adding error handling around potential failures in parsing or mapping to improve robustness.

*Note:* All refactoring recommendations must remain compliant with ES5 standards. Avoid using ES6 features such as arrow functions, template literals, or block-scoped variable declarations (let/const).

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  - Regularly review and update the mapping in `utag.sender[894].map` to ensure compatibility with evolving data requirements.
  - Maintain comprehensive test coverage for various query string formats, including edge cases.

- **Ownership and Testing:**  
  - Clearly designate an owner or maintainer for this extension to ensure prompt updates and troubleshooting.
  - Incorporate unit testing or manual tests in each Tealium release cycle to verify the extension’s behaviour, especially after configuration or system updates.

- **Documentation Review:**  
  - Keep this documentation up-to-date with changes to the extension. Document any deviations from standard behaviour or fixes implemented over time.

- **Monitoring:**  
  - Consider logging unexpected issues or discrepancies during execution (if allowed by the environment) to aid diagnostics in production.
