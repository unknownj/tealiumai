# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name**: What if fudge but too much?
- **ID**: 1211
- **Type**: Advanced Javascript Code
- **Scope**: 894
- **Execution Frequency**: On specified events (eventType)

### Summary
This extension checks for a specific condition via the `window.deferWT` global variable. If `window.deferWT` contains the string `"please"`, it modifies the variable's value and aborts the execution flow by returning `false`. This serves as a control mechanism to defer further event processing based on specific criteria, thereby allowing for conditional behaviour in the data layer.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- **window.deferWT**: A global variable that holds a string. This variable serves as a flag to determine whether to proceed with further processing of the event.

### Logic Flow
1. The extension is defined as an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) that takes three parameters: `eventType`, `eventPayload`, and `tagObject`.
2. The code checks the current value of `window.deferWT`:
   - If it equals `"please"`, it updates `window.deferWT` to `"okay"`.
   - The function then returns `false`, preventing any further actions from being taken as a result of this event.

### Dependencies
- The script relies on the `window` object for accessing `deferWT`, ensuring that this variable is defined in the global scope.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Condition
1. **Scenario**: The extension is triggered by an event where `window.deferWT` is `"please"`.
   - **Input**: `window.deferWT` = `"please"`
   - **Output**: `window.deferWT` changes to `"okay"`; event processing stops here.

### Edge Condition
2. **Scenario**: The extension is triggered again and `window.deferWT` is not `"please"`.
   - **Input**: `window.deferWT` = `"okay"`
   - **Output**: The extension does nothing; processing continues as normal without interference.

### Resultant Behaviour
The extension functions as a guard, limiting the processing of events based on the state of the `deferWT` variable. This can be useful in scenarios where conditional processing is required to manage event flows effectively.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **State Dependency**: The extension heavily relies on the state of `window.deferWT`. If this variable is modified elsewhere without careful consideration, it may lead to unintended behaviour.
- **No Fallback**: There are no fallback mechanisms in place if `window.deferWT` does not equal `"please"`, which could potentially lead to a lack of control during event processing.
- **Conflicts**: If any other scripts modify `window.deferWT`, they could inadvertently affect the behaviour of this extension, leading to conflicts.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks**: Consider adding checks to ensure that `window.deferWT` stays in a controlled state, especially if it can be modified by other scripts.
- **Modularization**: While this script is simple, consider encapsulating the logic in a named function that clearly indicates its purpose. This would improve readability and maintainability.
- **Consistent Formatting**: Apply consistent indentation and spacing to enhance readability.

### Example Refactored Code
```javascript
(function checkDeferWT(eventType, eventPayload, tagObject){
    if (window.deferWT === "please") {
        window.deferWT = "okay";
        return false;
    }
})(eventType, eventPayload, tagObject);
```

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ownership**: Assign a primary owner for this extension to oversee its usage, modifications, and updates.
- **Testing Guidelines**: Establish a protocol for testing the extension after any modifications, ensuring it does not interfere with global events and behaves correctly under different states of `window.deferWT`.
- **Documentation Updates**: Regularly review and update the documentation to reflect any changes in the code or its usage within the broader project scope.
