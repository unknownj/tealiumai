# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: Event Enrichment

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name**: Event Enrichment
- **ID**: 1215
- **Type**: Advanced Javascript Code
- **Scope**: After Load Rules
- **Execution Frequency**: Run Always

### Summary

The Event Enrichment extension enhances the event data tracked by LBGAnalytics by identifying user gender based on account titles and enriching the product information based on the user's account data. This extension helps provide a deeper understanding of user demographics and product engagement, allowing for more targeted marketing strategies.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables

- **`e`**: Represents the LBGAnalytics events object used to log events (e.g., `pageView()` and `productsHeld()`).
- **`window.location.pathname`**: The current URL path used to determine if the user is on the account overview page.
- **`titleLookup`**: A mapping of common titles to genders.
- **`productLookup`**: A mapping of product codes to human-readable product names.
- **`products`**: An array that holds the enriched product names based on the user's account data.

### Logic Flow

1. The code checks if the event type is "view" using the `a` parameter, and logs a page view event if true.
2. If the user is on the `account_overview` page, it attempts to extract the user's title from an element with the class `.m-hf-02-name`:
   - The title is mapped to a gender using the `titleLookup` object.
   - If a gender is found, it adds the gender to the `eventPayload` (`b.CustomerGender`).
3. The code checks the `CoreDispatcher.loadMeta` to obtain the user's products:
   - It maps product codes to names using the `productLookup` object.
   - It cleanses the product array by removing any `undefined` values (up to 10 iterations).
4. Finally, it logs the products the user holds using `e.productsHeld(products)`.

### Global Dependencies

- **LBGAnalytics**: This global object is essential for logging the events.
- **window.CoreDispatcher**: This global object is required to access the user's loaded metadata.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Condition

- When a user navigates to the account overview page:
  - If the user’s title is "Mr", `b.CustomerGender` will be set to `Male`.
  - If the user’s account contains products with codes `SD` (Sharedealing) and `CC` (Credit Card), these will be sent to LBGAnalytics as logged products.

### Edge Conditions

- If the `.m-hf-02-name` element is not present, the `try-catch` block prevents any errors, and no gender will be logged.
- If the user has no products associated in the `CoreDispatcher.loadMeta`, an empty array will be sent, which may not offer valuable insights.

---

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **DOM Structure Dependence**: If the class `.m-hf-02-name` changes or the element is removed, the gender extraction will break silently (but safely due to the `try-catch`).
- **Product Lookup**: If a new product code is introduced, it will not be captured unless added to the `productLookup` object. Any undefined product codes in the array might also skew analytical results.
- **Event Dependency**: The code execution relies on the `CoreDispatcher` object being available. If not loaded prior to this extension, it may result in undefined behaviours.

---

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Input Validations**: Although JavaScript guarantees input variables (`eventType` and `eventPayload`), consider adding checks for the presence of required DOM elements before using them to improve robustness. 
- **Code Modularity**: The code could be structured into smaller functions to improve readability and maintainability. For instance:
  - A function to determine gender.
  - A function to map the products.
- **Clarifying Comments**: Additional comments can help future developers understand the purpose of each code block, particularly for the logic behind mapping titles to genders or products.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ownership**: Assign a developer or team responsible for maintaining and updating this extension, particularly the mappings.
- **Testing Guidelines**: Implement regular testing for the extension alongside any changes to the webpage structure that might affect DOM elements used within the code.
- **Documentation Updates**: Keep documentation up to date with any changes made to the extension, especially when the mappings or event logging logic is altered.
