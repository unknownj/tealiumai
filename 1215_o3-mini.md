## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Event Enrichment  
- **ID:** 1215 (Internal Extension ID)  
- **Extension Type:** Advanced Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** After Load Rules  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Always  

**Summary:**  
This extension enriches analytics events by performing additional processing based on the type of event and the context of the page. Specifically, it performs two main tasks:  
- It triggers a page view notification when the event type is "view".  
- It enriches the event payload with customer gender and products held information if the page URL contains "account_overview". In this scenario, it extracts the customer’s title from the DOM, infers the gender using a lookup table, and maps product codes (from an external data source) to product names before sending them to the analytics service via designated methods.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables and Global Dependencies

- **Local Function Parameters:**  
  - `a`: Represents the event type (guaranteed to be a string, e.g. "view").
  - `b`: Represents the event payload object.

- **Global Dependencies:**  
  - `window.LBGAnalytics.events`: An analytics events object, which contains methods such as `pageView()` and `productsHeld()` used to record events.
  - `window.CoreDispatcher.loadMeta`: An object that holds metadata regarding the products, typically present on account overview pages.
  
### Logic Flow

1. **Initial Event Type Check:**  
   The code verifies if the event type (`a`) is "view". If it is, it calls `e.pageView()`, signalling a page view event to the analytics system.

2. **Condition for Account Overview Page:**
   - The code checks if `window.location.pathname` contains the substring "account_overview" and whether `window.CoreDispatcher.loadMeta` with its method `loadMeta` is available. This ensures enrichment occurs only on the relevant page.
   
3. **Extracting Customer Title and Inferring Gender:**
   - A `try` block attempts to:
     - Select the DOM element with the class `.m-hf-02-name`.
     - Retrieve and trim the text content, then split by spaces to obtain the first word, assumed to be the customer’s title (e.g. "Mr", "Mrs").
   - A lookup object (`titleLookup`) maps valid titles to genders:
     - "Mr" and "Master" are mapped to "Male"  
     - "Mrs", "Miss" and "Ms" are mapped to "Female"
   - If a recognised title is found, the customer gender is added to the event payload (`b.CustomerGender`).

4. **Mapping Products Held and Enriching Event Data:**
   - A dictionary (`productLookup`) is defined to translate product codes into human-readable product names.
   - The keys from `window.CoreDispatcher.loadMeta` are iterated over using `Object.keys()` and mapped to their respective product names using the `productLookup` object.
   - A for-loop is then used to remove any occurrences of `undefined` from the `products` array, indicating unmapped product codes.
   - Finally, the enriched product information is added to the analytics events by calling `e.productsHeld(products)`.

### Code Dependencies and External Libraries

- Relies on the global variable `window.LBGAnalytics` for sending analytics events.
- Depends on `window.CoreDispatcher.loadMeta` for retrieving metadata regarding products.
- Uses native DOM methods such as `document.querySelector` to extract customer information from the page.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Conditions

- **Scenario 1: Page View without Account Overview Context**
  - Trigger: An event with type `"view"` is received.
  - Behaviour:  
    - The extension calls `e.pageView()` immediately.  
    - No additional processing occurs since the page URL does not include "account_overview", and therefore no gender or products data is added.

- **Scenario 2: Account Overview Page with Valid Customer Data**
  - Trigger: An event within a page where `window.location.pathname` includes "account_overview".
  - Setup:  
    - The DOM contains an element with the class `.m-hf-02-name` whose text value starts with a recognised title (e.g. "Mrs Jones").
    - `window.CoreDispatcher.loadMeta` contains product code keys (e.g. "SD", "INV").
  - Behaviour:  
    - The extension extracts "Mrs" from the customer name, maps it to "Female", and sets `b.CustomerGender = "Female"`.
    - The product codes are translated to product names (e.g. "Sharedealing", "Investment") and any undefined mappings are removed.
    - The enriched product information is passed to the analytics event via `e.productsHeld(products)`.

### Edge Conditions

- **Scenario 3: Missing or Unexpected DOM Structure**
  - Trigger: On an account overview page, the element `.m-hf-02-name` is either missing or does not contain the expected title.
  - Behaviour:  
    - The `try` block fails silently, and no `CustomerGender` is added to the event payload.
    - The rest of the enrichment process (product mapping) continues unaffected.

- **Scenario 4: Unmapped Product Codes**
  - Trigger: The `window.CoreDispatcher.loadMeta` object contains keys that do not match any in `productLookup`.
  - Behaviour:  
    - These keys translate to `undefined` values.
    - The for-loop cleans out the `undefined` entries from the `products` array before it is sent to the analytics event.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **DOM Dependency and Silent Failures:**
  - The extraction of customer title uses a `try` block with an empty `catch` block. If the DOM element is missing or the content structure changes, the code fails silently without logging an error. This could make debugging more difficult.

- **Product Lookup and Cleanup:**
  - The removal of `undefined` entries uses a fixed iteration loop (up to 10 tries). While this may work under normal circumstances, it is not a robust solution if the number of unmapped product codes exceeds the threshold.

- **Global Object Dependencies:**
  - The extension is tightly coupled with the external globals (`window.LBGAnalytics` and `window.CoreDispatcher`). If these objects change or are not available, enrichment will fail.

- **Potential Conflicts:**
  - There may be conflicts if other extensions or scripts manipulate the same global objects or DOM elements, potentially altering the expected behaviour of the enrichment process.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Coding Improvements:**
  - While it is guaranteed that `eventType` and `eventPayload` are available, consider adding more robust checks for the presence of DOM elements and properties on `window.CoreDispatcher.loadMeta`.  
  - Instead of using an empty `catch` block, log errors or warnings to help with debugging.

- **Product Array Cleansing:**
  - Replace the fixed iteration loop with a more robust filtering mechanism using a temporary array to collect only defined product mappings. This ensures that no undefined values persist in the products array regardless of their number.

- **Code Modularity:**
  - Separate the logic for customer gender extraction, product mapping, and event dispatching into distinct functions. This modularisation would improve readability and maintainability.
  - Consider abstracting the lookup tables (for titles and products) into configuration objects that can be easily updated or replaced.

- **Comments and Documentation:**
  - Increase in-line commenting to explain the purpose of key code sections, especially around the DOM manipulation and product mapping logic.
  - Document any assumptions made (for example, the structure of the `.m-hf-02-name` element) clearly in the code.

*Note: As the project requires ES5 support, avoid using ES6 features such as arrow functions, template literals, or let/const declarations.*

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**
  - Regularly review the dependencies on `window.LBGAnalytics` and `window.CoreDispatcher` to ensure compatibility with any updates to these libraries.
  - Update the lookup tables if there are any changes to product codes or customer title conventions.
  - Monitor error logs (should you decide to implement error messaging) to track and address any silent failures.

- **Ownership and Testing:**
  - Assign clear code ownership for this extension within the development team to ensure prompt updates and debugging.
  - Implement unit tests for the parsing logic and key functions (e.g. gender extraction, product mapping) to ensure correct behaviour during future changes.
  - Carry out integration tests particularly on pages that are expected to trigger the enrichment (i.e. pages containing "account_overview").

- **Documentation Updates:**
  - Keep this documentation up-to-date with any code changes or enhancements.  
  - Ensure that any refactoring decisions or architectural changes are reflected both in the code comments and in the external documentation provided to stakeholders.
