# OVA : TAG : Set : Lloyds : Event Listeners : Mortgage

This document provides an in-depth overview, code explanation, usage examples, known limitations, and recommendations for the extension.

---

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** OVA : TAG : Set : Lloyds : Event Listeners : Mortgage
- **ID:** 1216 (extension identifier within the Tealium iQ environment)  
- **Extension Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** 995  
- **Execution Frequency:**  
  - Runs once upon execution, as a guard variable (`u.initialised`) is used to ensure that the code executes only one time during page load.

- **Summary:**  
  This extension dynamically loads a virtual assistant script for Lloyds Bank and attaches several event listeners that fire tracking events via `utag.link` when specific user interactions occur. The listeners capture events such as overlay triggers, form submissions, and link clicks, providing valuable data to help track the user journey through the virtual assistant experience.

---

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables and Elements

- **u.initialised:**  
  Acts as a guard to ensure initialization logic runs only one time. If not initialised, the code sets this property to true.

- **cvdiv:**  
  Creates a DIV element with the ID "virtual-assistant". This container is used to embed the virtual assistant script.

- **cvscript:**  
  Creates a SCRIPT element whose source is set to "https://lloydsbank.creativevirtual.com/lloyds_emb/va.min.js". This loads the virtual assistant functionality into the page.

- **c$:**  
  A local alias for the jQuery-like library `window.clova2.$`. This library is used to add event listeners to DOM elements.

### Logic Flow

1. **Initialisation Check:**  
   The function first checks if the global `u.initialised` flag is not set. If false, it sets the flag to true to prevent reinitialisation.

2. **Script and Element Injection:**  
   - A new DIV (`cvdiv`) is created with the ID "virtual-assistant".
   - A SCRIPT element (`cvscript`) is created and assigned the required source URL for loading the virtual assistant.
   - The SCRIPT element is appended to the DIV, and the DIV is in turn appended to the document body.

3. **Event Listener Attachments:**  
   Using `c$`, three distinct event listeners are assigned:
   - **Trigger Overlay Click:**  
     When any `div` with the class `va-trigger` is clicked, a tracking event is fired (via `utag.link`) with parameters:
       - JourneyName: "VirtualAssistant"
       - JourneyStep: 1
       - JourneyEvent: "Overlay"
   - **Form Submission Click:**  
     When an input button with class `va-inp-btn` and a value of "Submit" is clicked, a tracking event is triggered with:
       - JourneyName: "VirtualAssistant"
       - JourneyStep: 2
       - JourneyEvent: "Field Update"
       - EventAction: "Filter"
       - EventNarrative: "Virtual Assistant Search"
       - EventValue: The value from an input field with the name `entry`
   - **FAQ Link Click:**  
     When a link within elements matched by the selectors `.va-faq-ul li a` or `.va-faqs li a` is clicked, the script records:
       - JourneyName: "VirtualAssistant"
       - JourneyStep: 3
       - JourneyEvent: "Internal Link"
       - EventAction: "Supporting Information"
       - EventNarrative: The text of the clicked link

### Dependencies

- **Global Variables/Objects:**  
  - `window.document` and `window` for DOM manipulation.
  - `window.utag` for firing tracking events using `utag.link`.
  - `window.clova2.$` for DOM event binding similar to jQuery.  
- **External Script Dependency:**  
  The script sourced from "https://lloydsbank.creativevirtual.com/lloyds_emb/va.min.js" is essential for the virtual assistant functionality.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Operation Scenario

1. **Page Load:**  
   - The extension is executed.
   - It checks for the `initialised` flag; upon not being set, it creates and appends the virtual assistant DIV and SCRIPT to the DOM.
   
2. **User Interaction – Overlay Display:**  
   - The user clicks on a `div` element with the class `va-trigger`.
   - A tracking event is fired with:
     - JourneyName: "VirtualAssistant"
     - JourneyStep: 1
     - JourneyEvent: "Overlay"

3. **User Interaction – Form Submission:**  
   - The user clicks on an input of type "button", with class `va-inp-btn` and a value "Submit".
   - The script gathers the value from an input (with name `entry`) and fires a tracking event containing the data entered by the user.

4. **User Interaction – FAQ Link Click:**  
   - When the user clicks any link within the FAQ lists (using the selectors `.va-faq-ul li a` or `.va-faqs li a`), a tracking event is triggered that records the clicked link's text.

### Edge Case Scenario

- **Multiple Executions:**  
  The guard (`u.initialised`) ensures that subsequent executions of the extension on the same page do not re-inject the DIV or rebind event listeners. This prevents duplicate event registrations and script injections.
  
- **Missing Elements:**  
  - If the targeted elements (e.g. `div.va-trigger` or input fields) are not present on the page, no event listeners are triggered.
  - The reliance on `c$` (from `window.clova2.$`) presumes that this library is correctly loaded. If not, the listener bindings will fail silently, leaving user interactions untracked.

---

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Global Dependency on window.clova2.$:**  
  If the `window.clova2.$` library is not available or loaded after this extension runs, then event bindings will not function, potentially causing a loss in tracking data.

- **External Script Availability:**  
  The virtual assistant functionality is dependent on the script from "https://lloydsbank.creativevirtual.com/lloyds_emb/va.min.js". If this resource is unavailable or delayed, the virtual assistant might not operate as intended.

- **Event Listener Specificity:**  
  - Fixed selectors (e.g. `div.va-trigger`, `input.va-inp-btn[value=Submit]`) require the DOM elements to match exactly. Any changes in the page structure or class names may break the functionality.
  - If duplicate elements exist, multiple tracking events might be fired, or if no elements match, no tracking occurs.

- **Potential Conflicts:**  
  - Other Tealium extensions or scripts manipulating similar DOM elements or using `utag.link` may conflict if not coordinated.
  - Careful management is needed when multiple extensions modify the same elements or register similar event listeners.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive DOM Element Checks:**  
  Although the code is written for environments where eventType and eventPayload are guaranteed, consider adding checks to ensure expected DOM elements (e.g. verifying the existence of the body element before appending the DIV).

- **Modularisation:**  
  Consider breaking down event listener logic into separate functions to improve readability and maintainability. This separation also aids unit testing individual listener behaviours.

- **Clearer Variable Naming:**  
  - Rename variables like `cvdiv` and `cvscript` to reflect their purpose more clearly (e.g. `assistantContainer`, `assistantScript`).

- **Error Handling:**  
  Although not critical now, incorporating try/catch blocks around external script execution or event binding logic could prevent the entire extension from failing in case of rare runtime errors.

- **Documentation Comments:**  
  Embedding comments within the code itself to explain each step would be beneficial for future developers and maintainers.

- **Avoid Duplicate Binding:**  
  Should the extension potentially run more than once (e.g. on single-page applications), ensure proper cleanup or re-binding of event handlers if the DOM changes.

> Note: Do not use ES2015/ES6 features (e.g. arrow functions, let/const, template literals) as the current environment requires ES5 support.
