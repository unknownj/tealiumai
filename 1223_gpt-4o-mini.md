# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: Read NGA Constants

## 1. Extension Overview
- **Name**: Read NGA Constants
- **ID**: 1223
- **Type**: Advanced Javascript Code
- **Scope**: Before Load Rules
- **Execution Frequency**: Run Always

### Summary
The "Read NGA Constants" extension is designed to enhance data flow by checking for the presence of a `nga_constants` object in the global window. If found, it flags the traffic as originating from a webview and copies relevant data items, including hashed Personally Identifiable Information (PII), into the Tealium data layer. This extension ensures that critical information is available for further processing while adhering to privacy measures.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- `window.nga_constants`: Checks if the NGA constants object exists in the global `window` object.
- `b`: Represents the `eventPayload`, where processed data is stored and passed into Tealium.
- `n`: The `tealium` object inside `nga_constants`, which contains various key-value pairs.
- `gMail`: Constructed to hold the formatted email address if it matches specific criteria.

### Logic Flow
1. The extension first checks whether `window.nga_constants` exists:
   - If it does, it processes any tealium-specific data.
   - It hashes specific PII (`FirstPartyEmail`, `FirstPartyPhone`) using SHA-256 for privacy.
   - It uniquely formats email addresses originating from Gmail or Googlemail.
2. If `window.nga_constants` is not found, it tracks the time when the search for it started and sets a polling mechanism (checked every 200ms):
   - Upon finding `nga_constants`, it clears the interval and logs the time taken for its discovery.

### Dependencies
- **Global Objects**: Relies on `window.nga_constants` and its structure.
- **Libraries**: Utilizes `utag.ut.sha256.SHA256` for hashing PII.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Condition
- **Scenario**: The `nga_constants` object is found with the tealium data items populated.
  - The `FirstPartyEmail` and `FirstPartyPhone` values are hashed and stored in the `eventPayload`.
  - The email is checked for 'gmail.com' and formatted accordingly.

### Edge Condition
- **Scenario**: The `nga_constants` object is not initially present.
  - The extension will keep polling every 200ms until it either finds the object or the page is unloaded.
  - If `nga_constants` is eventually found, an analytics event logs the duration of the search.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas
- **Polling Interval**: If the `nga_constants` object is never loaded (due to network issues or script errors), the extension could continue running the interval indefinitely, which may lead to unnecessary resource consumption.
- **Potential Conflicts**: Other extensions that manipulate or rely on `window.nga_constants` could cause data overwrites or unexpected behaviours. Coordination with other scripts interacting with `nga_constants` is recommended.
- **Privacy Compliance**: Ensure that the presence and usage of personally identifiable information conforms to GDPR and other privacy regulations, especially if implementing this code across multiple regions.

---

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring
- **Defensive Checks**: Although no checks are needed for the availability of `eventType` and `eventPayload`, consider adding checks for `window.nga_constants` and its properties before accessing them.
- **Code Styles**: Organise the hashing function into a dedicated helper function to enhance readability and maintainability.
- **Modularisation**: If similar patterns are likely to arise, consider modularising the email formatting and hashing logic.
- **Performance Optimisations**: You could adjust the polling interval based on the expected response time for the `nga_constants` object.

```javascript
function hashPII(data) {
    // Hash PII implementation...
}
```

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes
- **Ongoing Maintenance**: Regularly review the extension for changes in how `nga_constants` may be provided by other scripts. Consider the addition of automated tests to validate behaviours.
- **Ownership**: Designate a team member to oversee this extension, with documented procedures for modifications and updates.
- **Testing Guidelines**: Always validate data integrity, especially ensuring that hashing is functioning correctly and that emails are formatted as intended. Include performance testing for scenarios with prolonged loading times.
