# Read NGA Constants Extension Documentation

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Read NGA Constants  
- **ID:** 1223  
- **Extension Type:** Advanced Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** Before Load Rules  
- **Occurrence:** Run Always  

**Summary:**  
This extension is designed to detect the presence of a global object (nga_constants) and, if found, process its properties to flag traffic as "Webview" and copy data items into the Tealium data layer. For key Personally Identifiable Information (PII) fields such as FirstPartyEmail and FirstPartyPhone, the extension applies SHA256 hashing before storing them. Additionally, if the email domain is recognised as Gmail or Googlemail, it removes any periods in the username part before hashing a secondary value (FirstPartyGmail). In cases where the nga_constants object is not immediately available, the extension initiates a periodic check (every 200ms) and then fires an analytical event once the object is found, indicating the latency.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables & Global Dependencies

- **window.nga_constants:**  
  The extension checks for the global object `nga_constants` that is expected to hold Tealium-related data items.  
- **window.ngaConstantsSearchTimestamp:**  
  A global timestamp used to record when the extension began waiting for the `nga_constants` object.  
- **window.ngaConstantsSearchInterval:**  
  A global interval ID for periodically checking the presence of the `nga_constants` object.
- **utag.ut.sha256.SHA256:**  
  The extension depends on Tealium’s SHA256 hashing library to hash PII fields.

### Logic Flow

1. **Initial Check for nga_constants:**  
   - The extension first checks if `window.nga_constants` is defined.
   - If available:
     - It verifies whether the `tealium` nested object exists.
     - If so, it flags the traffic by setting `eventPayload.PresentationFamily` to "Webview" (where `eventPayload` is the second parameter alias `b`).
     - It iterates through each property in `window.nga_constants.tealium`:
       - **For PII fields (FirstPartyEmail & FirstPartyPhone):**
         - Checks that the property value is neither empty nor null.
         - Applies a SHA256 hash to the value and stores the result in `eventPayload` under the same key.
         - If the key is for "FirstPartyEmail", additional processing occurs:
           - Splits the email address on the "@" character.
           - If the domain matches Gmail (either gmail.com or googlemail.com), all periods in the local part are removed.
           - A new string is built (gMail) from the modified local part and the original domain.
           - The hash of this processed email (gMail) is then stored in `eventPayload.FirstPartyGmail`.
       - **For non-PII fields:**  
         - Simply copies the value from `window.nga_constants.tealium` into `eventPayload`.
   
2. **Handling the Absence of nga_constants:**
   - If `nga_constants` is not found and a search timestamp has not yet been recorded:
     - Records a timestamp (`window.ngaConstantsSearchTimestamp`) marking when the search began.
     - Sets an interval timer (`window.ngaConstantsSearchInterval`) running every 200 milliseconds.
   - Within each interval:
     - Checks if `window.nga_constants` is present.
     - Once found:
       - Clears the interval to stop further checking.
       - Fires a Tealium analytics event using `utag.view()`.
         - The event logs details (JourneyEvent, EventAction, EventNarrative) about how long it took from the initial timestamp to locate the `nga_constants` object.

### Dependencies

- **Global Object Dependencies:**  
  The code depends on the presence of `window.nga_constants` and optionally uses global signalling variables (`window.ngaConstantsSearchTimestamp` and `window.ngaConstantsSearchInterval`).
- **Third-Party Libraries:**  
  The SHA256 method is accessed via `utag.ut.sha256.SHA256`, which is presumed to be available in the Tealium environment.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Scenario
1. A webpage or application loads, and `window.nga_constants` is already defined.
2. The extension copies the nested `tealium` data into the Tealium data layer, hashing PII values.
3. For an example email "john.doe@gmail.com":
   - The standard property `FirstPartyEmail` is hashed.
   - The domain is recognised as Gmail, so any periods in the local part are removed (e.g. "johndoe@gmail.com") and that value is also hashed and stored as `FirstPartyGmail`.
4. Data is then made immediately available for Tealium processing.

### Edge/Delayed Scenario
1. The webpage loads and `window.nga_constants` is not immediately defined.
2. The extension sets a search timestamp (`window.ngaConstantsSearchTimestamp`) and begins checking every 200ms.
3. Once the `nga_constants` object becomes available, the search interval is cleared.
4. An analytics event is fired indicating the time (in deciseconds) taken to find the API response.
5. Note: During this waiting period, data might not be available for the immediate processing of the Tealium data layer.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Timing Issues:**  
  If `nga_constants` is delayed significantly, there may be a gap in data availability which could affect subsequent Tealium load processing.
  
- **Duplicate Global Variables:**  
  The use of global variables (e.g. window.ngaConstantsSearchTimestamp) can potentially conflict with other scripts if similar variable names are used. Ensure naming consistency across your implementations.
  
- **Dependence on SHA256 Library:**  
  If the SHA256 functionality (utag.ut.sha256.SHA256) is not fully loaded or available, the PII hashing process will fail. Ensure proper load order.
  
- **Edge Cases in Email Parsing:**  
  The email parsing mechanism splits on "@". An email with irregular formatting might bypass intended handling.
  
- **No Fallback Behaviour:**  
  The extension does not provide fallback values if expected properties (like FirstPartyEmail or FirstPartyPhone) are completely missing or not in the expected format. Validate upstream data quality if issues arise.

- **ES5 Constraint:**  
  Being limited to ES5, the extension uses older syntax (e.g. function declarations and var instead of more modern commands). This could affect readability and modularity but ensures wide compatibility.

---

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Code Organisation & Modularisation:**  
  - Consider wrapping the email processing logic into a separate helper function to promote code reuse and clarity.
  - Modularise the logic for iterating over the properties, thereby reducing code repetition.
  
- **Error Handling:**  
  - Although defensive coding for eventType and eventPayload is not required by the current requirements, additional error handling might be considered for the SHA256 hashing process or if the structure of window.nga_constants changes.
  
- **Comments & Documentation:**  
  - Keep inline comments concise and up-to-date with any changes in the processing logic.
  - Document both the expected structure of window.nga_constants and any external dependencies (like SHA256) within the codebase.
  
- **Interval Handling Improvements:**  
  - The code currently polls every 200ms. Evaluate whether this frequency best balances responsiveness vs. resource usage, especially in high-load environments.
  
- **Maintain ES5 Standards:**  
  - Continue using ES5 syntax to ensure compatibility. Avoid modern methods such as arrow functions, template literals, let/const, etc.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  - Regularly verify that the global objects and libraries assumed by this extension haven’t been altered in subsequent Tealium releases.
  - Establish monitoring to ensure that the polling logic (retry for nga_constants) behaves as expected under different network or application load conditions.
  
- **Ownership:**  
  - Maintain a clear changelog and assign a team or individual reviewer for updates to the extension code.
  
- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Write unit tests for the helper functions (if refactored into separate modules) to simulate various input scenarios including edge cases.
  - Use both manual and automated testing environments to ensure that occasional delays in `nga_constants` availability are correctly handled and that analytics events fire as expected.
  - Continuously test the hashing functionality to confirm that sensitive PII information is never stored in plain text.

- **Documentation Updates:**  
  - Ensure that any future code changes are reflected in the documentation to keep stakeholders and developers in sync with the extension's functionality.
