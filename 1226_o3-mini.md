# In Flight Adobe Event Triggers Extension Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the "In Flight Adobe Event Triggers" extension for Tealium iQ. It covers the extension’s purpose, operation, usage examples, limitations, recommendations, and maintenance notes.

---

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** In Flight Adobe Event Triggers
- **ID:** 1226 (Extension internal) / 100040 (Extension instance)
- **Type:** Advanced JavaScript Code
- **Scope:** After Load Rules
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Always

**Summary:**  
This extension is designed to call various methods on the global LBGAnalytics.events object based on the contents of the event payload (eventPayload) and the event type (eventType). It processes different event actions and application states, triggering corresponding generic events. The extension primarily facilitates tracking and auditing of user interactions for Adobe Analytics integration, enabling conditional event triggers based on payload parameters such as EventAction, JourneyUniqueID, ApplicationState, and others.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables

- **a:** Represents the event type; used to differentiate contexts (e.g. "view").
- **b:** Represents the event payload; an object containing various properties such as EventAction, JourneyUniqueID, EventNarrative, etc.
- **e:** A shortcut reference to `window.LBGAnalytics.events`, a global object assumed to provide tracking methods.

### Logic Flow

1. **Field Update Event Handling:**  
   - Checks if `b.EventAction` equals "Field Update".
   - If true, calls `e.fieldUpdate` with `b.EventNarrative` and `b.EventDuration` as parameters.

2. **Journey Event Handling:**  
   - Validates that `b.JourneyUniqueID` exists.
   - Stores the journey identifier in the variable `jid`.
   - Calls a series of generic events (IDs: 26, 27, 28, 29, 31, 32) based on the value of `b.ApplicationState`.
   - For the "Fulfilled" state:
     - Calls generic event 30.
     - If `b.JourneyAmount` is provided, calls generic event 45 with that amount.
     - Checks if `b.JourneyAction` equals "Transaction Complete" and then triggers generic events 47 and 48 respectively (the latter again using `b.JourneyAmount`).

3. **Branch Locator Specific Events:**  
   - If the event type (`a`) equals "view" and the payload’s `JourneyName` equals "BranchFinder":
     - Calls generic event 79, setting the variable `SearchType` to "Branch Locator".
   - If `b.EventAction` is "Page Submit", `b.EventNarrative` is "Search", and `b.JourneyName` is "BranchFinder":
     - Calls generic event 80 with the same variable setting.
   - For service actions on the BranchFinder during a search (when on `/branch-locator/search.asp` page and `b.EventAction` equals "Service Action Complete"):
     - Calls generic event 83 with the variable `SearchType` set to "Branch Locator".

### Dependencies

- The code relies on the global object `window.LBGAnalytics.events` and its methods:
  - `fieldUpdate`
  - `genericEvent`
  - The `genericEvent` method appears to be chainable, allowing the subsequent call to `setVariables`.
- The event payload (b) must contain specific properties like `EventAction`, `JourneyUniqueID`, `ApplicationState`, `JourneyAmount`, `JourneyAction`, `JourneyName`, etc., to ensure proper triggering of events.
- Relies on the browser’s `window.location.pathname` to determine the current URL path for specific BranchFinder events.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Example 1: Field Update Event
- **Payload:**
  - EventAction: "Field Update"
  - EventNarrative: "User updated field X"
  - EventDuration: 5  
- **Behaviour:**
  - The code calls `e.fieldUpdate("User updated field X", 5)`.

### Example 2: Journey Event with Fulfilled State and Transaction
- **Payload:**
  - JourneyUniqueID: "JID12345"
  - ApplicationState: "Fulfilled"
  - JourneyAmount: 250.00
  - JourneyAction: "Transaction Complete"  
- **Behaviour:**
  - The code calls `e.genericEvent(26, 1, "JID12345")` for a valid journey.
  - It then calls `e.genericEvent(30, 1, "JID12345")` because ApplicationState is "Fulfilled".
  - Calls `e.genericEvent(45, 250.00, "JID12345")` for the JourneyAmount.
  - Upon checking JourneyAction, it calls `e.genericEvent(47, 1, "JID12345")` and `e.genericEvent(48, 250.00, "JID12345")`.

### Example 3: BranchLocator View and Search Actions
- **Payload Scenario for View Event:**
  - eventType (a): "view"
  - b.JourneyName: "BranchFinder"  
- **Behaviour:**
  - Triggers `e.genericEvent(79)` and attaches `{ SearchType: "Branch Locator" }` via `setVariables`.

- **Payload Scenario for Page Submit Search:**
  - EventAction: "Page Submit"
  - EventNarrative: "Search"
  - JourneyName: "BranchFinder"  
- **Behaviour:**
  - Triggers `e.genericEvent(80)` with the variable `{ SearchType: "Branch Locator" }`.

- **Payload Scenario for Service Action on a specific URL:**
  - EventAction: "Service Action Complete"
  - JourneyName: "BranchFinder"
  - Window location path equals: "/branch-locator/search.asp"  
- **Behaviour:**
  - Triggers `e.genericEvent(83)` with the variable `{ SearchType: "Branch Locator" }`.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Reliance on Global Object:**  
  The extension entirely depends on the existence and proper functioning of `window.LBGAnalytics.events`. If this object is absent or altered by other scripts, the extension will fail.

- **Strict Payload Requirements:**  
  The logic is heavily dependent on specific properties in the payload (b). Missing or incorrectly named properties could lead to no events being triggered.

- **Hardcoded URL Check:**  
  The check for `window.location.pathname` being exactly `"/branch-locator/search.asp"` is very specific. Changes in URL structure or deployment in different environments may require adjustments.

- **Sequential Condition Checks:**  
  Since conditions are nested and sequential (especially within Journey events), incorrect order of properties or unexpected values might cause unintentional behaviour.

- **Dependencies on External Methods:**  
  The methods such as `genericEvent` and `setVariables` are assumed to work correctly. Any breaking changes in their implementations could affect the extension’s functionality.

- **Potential Conflicts:**  
  If other Tealium iQ extensions or external scripts modify or override properties on the global LBGAnalytics object, conflicts might arise.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks (Where Applicable):**  
  Although the eventType and eventPayload (b) are guaranteed to be present, consider implementing further checks on critical properties (e.g. ensuring `window.LBGAnalytics` and `window.LBGAnalytics.events` exist) to avoid runtime errors if external dependencies fail.

- **Modularisation of Logic:**  
  Refactor the code into smaller functions for each event type (e.g. a function for handling journey events, another for BranchFinder events). This would improve readability and ease testing.  
  Example (in ES5 style):
  ```
  function handleJourneyEvent(payload) {
      // logic for JourneyUniqueID handling
  }
  ```
  And then simply call this function passing the payload.

- **Code Style Improvements:**  
  - Use clear and consistent indentation.
  - Comment sections of the code to indicate which block handles which events.
  - Consolidate repetitive checks where possible to simplify the code logic.

- **Enhance URL Handling:**  
  Consider abstracting the URL check into a helper function. This makes the code easier to update should the URL pattern change:
  ```
  function isBranchLocatorSearch() {
      return window.location.pathname === '/branch-locator/search.asp';
  }
  ```

- **Test Coverage:**  
  Write unit tests covering different payload scenarios to ensure each conditional branch behaves as expected, especially after refactoring changes.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**
  - Ensure that any changes to global objects (e.g. LBGAnalytics) or their methods are communicated clearly and that tests are updated accordingly.
  - Keep the extension documentation updated with any modifications or adjustments.
  - Maintain clear version control and change logs for modifications to the extension.

- **Ownership & Support:**
  - Assign a primary maintainer or team responsible for monitoring the integration between TealiumiQ and Adobe Analytics.
  - Schedule regular reviews to check for deprecations or conflicts with newer versions of external libraries or Tealium iQ itself.

- **Testing Guidelines:**
  - Use staging environments to test changes before deployment.
  - Validate new payload scenarios and edge cases with both standard and unexpected inputs.
  - Regularly verify that dependencies (such as `window.LBGAnalytics.events` and its methods) are functioning correctly.

- **Documentation:**
  - Include inline comments in the code to further explain complex logic.
  - Provide examples of expected payloads in the developer documentation.
  - Maintain a FAQ section to address common issues which might be encountered by future developers.
