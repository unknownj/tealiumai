# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the "Let's Kill Webtrends! (v8 tag)" extension. It covers the extension’s purpose, code walkthrough, usage examples, known limitations, and recommendations for future improvements.

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Let's Kill Webtrends! (v8 tag)
- **ID:** 1228
- **Extension Type:** Advanced Javascript Code
- **Scope:** Pre Loader
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Once

**Summary:**  
This extension is designed to prevent Webtrends tracking by setting an opt-out cookie. When executed, the extension creates a cookie named "WTLOPTOUT" with the value "X". The cookie is set to expire in 180 days and is available across the entire website (path set to "/"). This is typically used to disable Webtrends tracking on a user's journey on the site.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables & Logic Flow

- **IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression):**  
  The entire code is wrapped in a function that executes immediately upon loading. This pattern ensures that the code runs as soon as it is loaded within the Pre Loader scope.

- **Variable "d":**  
  A new Date object is created and stored in the variable `d`. This represents the current date and time.

- **Setting the Expiry Date:**  
  The code adds 180 days to the current time by using `d.setTime(d.getTime() + (180 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000));`.  
  - Calculation:  
    180 days × 24 hours/day × 60 minutes/hour × 60 seconds/minute × 1000 milliseconds/second.

- **Creating the "expires" String:**  
  The expiry date is converted to a UTC string and concatenated into a format suitable for the `document.cookie` property, resulting in a string like:  
  `"expires=<UTC Date String>"`.

- **Cookie Assignment:**  
  The cookie is set using the `document.cookie` property. The resulting string is:  
  `"WTLOPTOUT=X; <expiry>; path=/"`.

### Dependencies on Global Objects

- **window.document:**  
  The extension relies on the global `document` object (passed as an argument to the IIFE) to set the cookie.

- **Date Object:**  
  The built-in Date object is used to calculate the expiration date for the cookie.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Condition

**Scenario:**  
A user visits the website running the Tealium iQ implementation.

**Data Flow & Behaviour:**  
- Upon page load, the extension executes.
- The IIFE runs immediately, calculating a date 180 days in the future.
- The "WTLOPTOUT" cookie is set with the value "X" and an expiry date set in 180 days.
- The cookie is available across the entire website, potentially preventing tracking by Webtrends.

### Edge Conditions

**Scenario 1: Cookie Overwrite**  
- If the "WTLOPTOUT" cookie already exists, this extension will overwrite it with the new 180-day timeline.  
- Behaviour: The cookie's expiry is updated, ensuring the opt-out remains effective for the new duration.

**Scenario 2: Non-Standard Environments**  
- In environments where the `document.cookie` property might behave unexpectedly (due to browser policies or security restrictions), the cookie may not be set as expected.  
- Behaviour: The opt-out may not function correctly if cookies are disabled or manipulated by other scripts.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Cookie Overwriting:**  
  Since the cookie is set unconditionally, any pre-existing "WTLOPTOUT" value will be overwritten. Consider if multiple scripts intend to manage this cookie.

- **Dependency on document.cookie:**  
  The extension assumes that the `document` object and its `cookie` property will behave consistently across all environments. Unusual browser behaviours or strict cookie policies (e.g., SameSite restrictions) might affect functionality.

- **Execution Frequency:**  
  The extension is configured to run only once ("Run Once"). If conditions on the website later change or if there's a need to re-assess the cookie status, this extension will not automatically execute again.

- **Potential Conflicts:**  
  There may be conflicts with other Tealium extensions or external scripts that manipulate cookies, particularly those that also target Webtrends tracking settings.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Coding:**  
  While eventType and eventPayload availability is assured, consider adding defensive checks for the availability of the `document` object to enhance robustness in non-browser environments.

- **Code Comments and Readability:**  
  Enhancing inline comments to explain the purpose of key operations (e.g. the date computation and cookie string construction) can improve maintainability.

- **Modularisation:**  
  If future extensions require similar cookie management operations, consider abstracting the cookie setting logic into a helper function to avoid code duplication.

- **Standardisation:**  
  Ensure that cookie parameters (like path and expiration date format) remain standardised across other extensions managing similar tasks.

- **ES5 Compliance:**  
  Continue to ensure ES5 compatibility throughout the code. Avoid ES2015/ES6 syntax such as arrow functions, template literals, let/const, etc., to maintain compatibility with older environments.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Testing:**  
  Regularly test the extension across the major browsers and devices to ensure consistent behaviour, particularly after any updates to the website or third-party libraries that might impact cookie handling.

- **Code Ownership:**  
  Define clear ownership responsibilities for the extension. Ensure that any modifications are documented and reviewed by a team familiar with Tealium iQ and the website’s analytics setup.

- **Version Control:**  
  Maintain versioning within your Tealium iQ extension library. Clearly document changes, especially those that affect cookie handling or execution timing.

- **Future Enhancements:**  
  Monitor potential changes to browser cookie policies (such as updates to SameSite attributes) that may require modifications to the cookie string format.

- **Documentation Updates:**  
  Keep this documentation up-to-date with any changes or refactoring efforts to ensure all stakeholders are informed about the extension’s operation and status.
