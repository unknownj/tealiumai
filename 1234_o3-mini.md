# Downloads Extension Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive overview and explanation of the Downloads extension implemented in Tealium iQ. It covers the extension's purpose, code flow, usage, known limitations, recommendations, and maintenance guidelines.

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Downloads  
- **ID:** 1234  
- **Extension Type:** Advanced Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** DOM Ready  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Once  

**Summary:**  
This extension is designed to capture and process download events on the website for PDF and XLS files. When a user clicks on a link ending with ".pdf" or ".xls", the extension extracts information such as the filename, file type, and an optional label. It then sets these values into designated variables and triggers a generic event with a specific event ID (140). There is also mapping of Tealium variables (`eVar160`, `eVar161`, and `eVar162`) to the extracted data for downstream analytics.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables and Functions

- **LBGAnalytics.events.download:**  
  - This is the main function that encapsulates the logic for processing download events.
  - **Parameters:**
    - `filename`: URL of the resource.
    - `label`: Text to be used for the event narrative or description.
    - `context`: Description of the file context (defaults to "Supporting Material" if not provided).
    - `filetype`: Optionally provided file type. If omitted, it is inferred from the file extension.

- **setVariables():**  
  - Called on the current context (`this`) to set the following variables:
    - `ResourceFileName`: the provided filename.
    - `ResourceFileType`: the provided file type or, if not provided, a calculated file extension extracted from the filename.
    - `ResourceFileContext`: the provided context or default value ("Supporting Material").
    - `JourneyEvent`: hard-coded to "External Click".
    - `EventAction`: hard-coded to "Supporting Material".
    - `EventNarrative`: uses the provided label if its length is less than 64 characters; otherwise, falls back to using the filename.
  
- **genericEvent(140):**  
  - Returns the result of creating a generic event with event ID 140, which signals a download event has occurred.

### Logic Flow

1. The `LBGAnalytics.events.download` function is defined to encapsulate setting variables and sending the generic event.
2. The function uses a fallback mechanism for:
   - `filetype`: If not provided, it reverses the filename string, splits it at the period, retrieves the file extension, reverses it back.
   - `context`: Defaults to "Supporting Material" if not provided.
   - `EventNarrative`: Uses the label if its length is less than 64 characters, otherwise, falls back on the filename.
3. After setting the key variables using `this.setVariables`, the function triggers a generic event by returning the result of `this.genericEvent(140)`.
4. Tealium sender mapping:
   - The extension maps the variables to specific Tealium variables using assignments to `utag.sender[928].map`:
     - `ResourceFileName` → `eVar160`
     - `ResourceFileType` → `eVar161`
     - `ResourceFileContext` → `eVar162`
5. The code sets up two click event listeners using jQuery (through `clova2.$`):
   - One for anchor elements with `href` ending with ".pdf".
   - One for anchor elements with `href` ending with ".xls" (added on 2020-11-19).
6. When a link is clicked, the anonymous callback is invoked:
   - It retrieves the link element (`l`) and extracts its `href` and text.
   - It calls `LBGAnalytics.events.download` with the extracted attributes.
   - Finally, it calls `.send()` on the returned event object to dispatch the event.

### Dependencies

- **Global Object Dependencies:**
  - `LBGAnalytics`: Must contain the `events.download` function and methods `setVariables` and `genericEvent`.
  - `utag.sender`: Assumes that sender 928 exists and is properly configured for mapping.
  - `clova2.$`: A jQuery-like library used for handling DOM events and element selection.

- **Third-Party Libraries:**
  - The extension depends on a jQuery-like API (through `clova2.$`) to attach event listeners and query DOM elements.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Scenario

- **Scenario:** A user clicks on a PDF download link.
  - The link's `href` attribute is "document.pdf".
  - The link's visible text is "Download Document".
- **Flow:**
  1. Click event triggers the handler bound to "a[href$='.pdf']".
  2. `LBGAnalytics.events.download` is called with:
     - `filename`: "document.pdf"
     - `label`: "Download Document"
  3. Inside the function:
     - `ResourceFileName` is set to "document.pdf".
     - `ResourceFileType` is calculated as "pdf" (using the reverse string method).
     - `ResourceFileContext` defaults to "Supporting Material".
     - `JourneyEvent` is set to "External Click".
     - `EventAction` is set to "Supporting Material".
     - `EventNarrative` is set to "Download Document" (since it is shorter than 64 characters).
  4. The generic event is triggered with event ID 140 and sent via `.send()`.

### Edge Conditions

- **Missing Label:**
  - If the label parameter is an empty string or very long (i.e., 64 characters or more), `EventNarrative` will fall back to using the filename.
- **Missing Filetype:**
  - If the filetype is not explicitly provided, the code infers it by reversing and processing the filename. Incorrectly formatted filenames might lead to unexpected extraction behaviour.
- **Non-PDF/XLS Files:**
  - The listeners only pick up `.pdf` and `.xls` links. Downloads of other file types will not be tracked unless additional listeners are added.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **File Name Parsing:**
  - The filetype extraction method using reverse-string logic may be vulnerable to irregular filenames. Consider testing edge cases such as filenames with multiple periods or without an extension.

- **Event Listener Specificity:**
  - The extension only supports files ending in `.pdf` and `.xls`. Other file formats are not captured unless similar event handlers are implemented.
  
- **Dependency on Global Objects:**
  - The code assumes the existence and readiness of global objects (`LBGAnalytics`, `utag.sender`, and `clova2.$`). Their failure or misconfiguration could cause errors.
  
- **Conflict with Other Extensions:**
  - If multiple extensions modify the same Tealium variable mappings or attach similar DOM event listeners, there could be conflicts. Ensure proper sequencing and non-overlapping selectors in the Tealium environment.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks:**
  - Although there is a guarantee for the presence of required objects (eventType, eventPayload) as per the requirements, consider verifying that the global objects (`LBGAnalytics`, `utag.sender`, `clova2.$`) are available before running the main logic.

- **Code Modularity:**
  - Encapsulate the filetype extraction logic into a separate helper function to increase readability and ease testing.
  - Abstract the common code used in the event listener callbacks (selecting the element, extracting attributes, sending events) to reduce code duplication.

- **Error Handling:**
  - Introduce error logging or graceful degradation if the click event handling fails due to unexpected DOM changes or missing attributes.
  
- **Commenting and Documentation:**
  - Enhance inline comments explaining key steps, especially for the filetype extraction logic, to help future maintainers quickly understand the code.

- **Maintain ES5 Syntax:**
  - Ensure that all improvements adhere to ES5 to remain compatible with the required environment. Avoid any ES2015+ features such as arrow functions, let/const, template literals, etc.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**
  - Regularly review the event click selectors to ensure they still match the website's updated HTML structure.
  - Monitor the mapping of Tealium variables (`eVar160`, `eVar161`, and `eVar162`) to ensure they continue to align with analytics requirements.

- **Ownership:**
  - Assign a primary maintainer or team responsible for updates, testing, and troubleshooting of the Downloads extension.
  
- **Testing Guidelines:**
  - Include unit tests for the filetype extraction helper function to validate its behaviour with various filename formats.
  - Create integration tests to simulate click events on the supported file types and verify that the correct variables are set and events dispatched.
  - Regression tests should be run after any refactoring to ensure that the extension's functionality remains unchanged.

- **Documentation Updates:**
  - Keep this documentation in sync with any code changes. Version control (ideally within a repository with clear commit messages) is recommended to track evolution and changes over time.
