# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name**: GDC : Scottish Widows : Quote RA/WP : 4746333 - dummy step
- **ID**: 1257
- **Type**: Set Data Values
- **Scope**: After Load Rules
- **Execution Frequency**: Run Always

### Summary
This extension is designed to track specific user interactions on a webpage related to the Scottish Widows brand. It listens for click events on specified elements and sends a generic event to the LBG Analytics service. The primary purpose is to capture user actions for analysis, allowing for enhanced marketing insights and better understanding of user behaviour during their journey.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- `window.clova2.$`: This is expected to be a jQuery-like library attached to the `window.clova2` object, used for DOM manipulation and event handling.
- `#sca_Trust_now` and `#sca_not_my_device`: These are the IDs of the clickable elements that trigger the JavaScript events.

### Logic Flow
1. The code begins by setting up an event listener for click events on the element with ID `#sca_Trust_now`.
2. When this element is clicked, a generic event with ID `171` is sent to the `window.LBGAnalytics.events` service.
3. A similar click event listener is set up for the element with ID `#sca_not_my_device`, which sends a different event with ID `172` upon being clicked.
4. The extension is executed within an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) that takes `eventType` and `eventPayload` as parameters, ensuring it runs with the provided context.

### Dependencies
- **jQuery-like Library**: The extension relies on a jQuery-like library encapsulated within the `window.clova2` object for DOM manipulation.
- **LBG Analytics**: It relies on the LBG Analytics global object to send events when users click the specified elements.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Conditions
1. **User Clicks "Trust Now"**: 
   - When a user clicks on the element with ID `#sca_Trust_now`, the extension captures this event and sends a generic event (event ID: 171) to the analytics system. 

2. **User Clicks "Not My Device"**: 
   - Similarly, clicking the `#sca_not_my_device` element will result in sending another generic event (event ID: 172).

### Edge Conditions
- **Element Not Present**: 
   - If either `#sca_Trust_now` or `#sca_not_my_device` is not present on the page when the script executes, the corresponding click event handler will not be attached, and therefore those events will not be tracked.

- **Multiple Clicks**: 
   - If a user clicks the same element multiple times in quick succession, this may result in multiple events being sent, which could skew analytics data. The extension does not currently implement debouncing or throttling.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Element Availability**: If the elements are dynamically loaded after the script runs, listeners will not be activated unless the code is modified to account for dynamic loading.
  
- **Conflict with Other Scripts**: 
   - If other JavaScript code manipulates the same elements or interferes with event delegation in a way that removes the event handlers set by this extension, it could lead to missing data.
  
- **Dependency on Global Objects**: The global `window.LBGAnalytics` must be correctly set up prior to this extension running; otherwise, the events will fail to be sent.

---

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Modularization**: Consider wrapping the event listener functionality in its own function to improve readability and maintainability.

    ```javascript
    function setUpClickEvent(selector, eventID) {
        window.clova2.$(document).on("click", selector, function() {
            window.LBGAnalytics.events.genericEvent(eventID).send();
        });
    }
    setUpClickEvent("#sca_Trust_now", 171);
    setUpClickEvent("#sca_not_my_device", 172);
    ```

- **Defensive Checks**: Although it is guaranteed that `eventType` and `eventPayload` are present, it is a good practice to check if `$` from `window.clova2` and `LBGAnalytics` are defined before using them to avoid runtime errors.

- **Reduce Global Scope Pollution**: Wrap the entire code in an IIFE as shown, which is already done, but ensure all variables required are passed in to limit global scope pollution.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance**: 
   - Regularly check the functionality of the extension in various browsers and devices to ensure it behaves as expected.
   - Keep an eye on the logs in the LBG Analytics to ensure event data is being captured without anomalies.

- **Ownership**: Assign a dedicated owner for the extension, responsible for monitoring and updating the code as required.

- **Testing Guidelines**: After any changes, conduct thorough testing in a staging environment before deploying to production. Validate that events are being sent correctly and troubleshoot any failures in real-time analytics monitoring.
