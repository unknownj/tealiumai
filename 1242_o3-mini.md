# SCA Events Extension Documentation

This document provides an in-depth overview of the "SCA Events" extension used in Tealium iQ. It covers the extension’s functionality, code explanation, usage examples, known limitations, refactoring recommendations, and guidance for ongoing maintenance.

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** SCA Events  
- **ID:** 1242  
- **Type:** Advanced Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** DOM Ready  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Once

**Summary:**  
The SCA Events extension is designed to track user interactions on specific page elements. It listens for click events on two elements identified by the IDs `sca_Trust_now` and `sca_not_my_device`. On triggering a click on either element, the extension sends a generic event to the external analytics system (via `window.LBGAnalytics.events.genericEvent`) using event codes 171 and 172 respectively. This allows the site to capture and report these user interactions for further analysis.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Code Structure and Flow

- **Event Binding:**  
  The extension utilises delegated event binding through the global object `window.clova2.$` (assumed to be an alias for jQuery `$(…)`). The code attaches event listeners to the entire document which ensures that click events on dynamically added elements with the specified IDs are captured.

- **Logic per Event:**
  - **For element with ID `sca_Trust_now`:**  
    When the element is clicked, the code invokes:
    ```javascript
    window.LBGAnalytics.events.genericEvent(171).send();
    ```
    This sends a generic event with the predefined event code 171.
    
  - **For element with ID `sca_not_my_device`:**  
    Similarly, on click the following code is executed:
    ```javascript
    window.LBGAnalytics.events.genericEvent(172).send();
    ```
    This sends a generic event with event code 172.

### Dependencies

- **Global Objects:**
  - `window.clova2.$`: The extension depends on this object as a jQuery alias for DOM event handling.
  - `window.LBGAnalytics.events.genericEvent`: An externally provided library function utilised to dispatch the event data to the analytics system.
  
- **Execution Timing:**  
  Since the extension is set to run in the "DOM Ready" scope, all DOM elements should already have been rendered, ensuring the event binding is effective.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Scenario

- **User Action:**  
  A user accesses a page and clicks on the element with the ID `sca_Trust_now`.
  
- **Extension Behaviour:**  
  The event listener attached to the document detects the click event and executes the following:
  ```javascript
  window.LBGAnalytics.events.genericEvent(171).send();
  ```
  This sends event code 171 to the analytics platform.

- **Alternate User Action:**  
  If the user clicks on the element with the ID `sca_not_my_device`, the process is analogous, sending event code 172.

### Edge Conditions

- **Element Absence:**  
  If either of the specified elements (`sca_Trust_now` or `sca_not_my_device`) is not present in the DOM:
  - No click event is captured, and hence no event is triggered.
  - The extension does not produce any errors because the event delegation is bound to the document, but the intended functionality will not execute.
  
- **Dependency Unavailability:**  
  If either `window.clova2.$` or `window.LBGAnalytics` is not defined at runtime:
  - The event binding or the event sending will fail.
  - Developers should ensure that these dependencies are loaded before this extension executes.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Dependence on External Libraries:**  
  The extension relies on the presence of `window.clova2.$` and `window.LBGAnalytics`. Any changes in these external libraries or their loading order could cause the extension to fail.

- **Dynamic DOM Changes:**  
  Although event delegation via the document is used to capture events on dynamically added elements, if elements are removed and re-added in a way that interferes with the propagation of events, tracking might become unreliable.

- **Potential Conflicts:**  
  If multiple extensions or external scripts attempt to handle click events on the same elements, there may be unintended interactions or conflicts. Care should be taken to ensure that event handlers are not duplicated or overwritten by other scripts.

---

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks:**  
  Although it is assumed that all necessary global objects will be available, it might be beneficial (in environments where debugging is crucial) to add simple checks to confirm that `window.clova2` and `window.LBGAnalytics` are defined before binding events and sending analytics data.

- **Code Modularity:**  
  Consider encapsulating the event binding logic in a reusable function. This would improve readability and ease future modifications if additional events need to be tracked.

- **Commenting and Code Style:**  
  Ensure comments are updated to describe the purpose of each code block. Maintain consistency with British English spellings and standard ES5 practices.

- **Error Handling:**  
  While defensive coding for the presence of event type and payload is not required, consider logging errors gracefully if any of the external dependencies fail at runtime.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  - Regularly verify that the external dependencies (`window.clova2` and `window.LBGAnalytics`) maintain compatibility with the extension.
  - Monitor the usage of IDs (`sca_Trust_now` and `sca_not_my_device`) across the web pages. Any DOM structure changes could necessitate an update in the selectors.

- **Ownership:**  
  Assign a dedicated team or individual responsible for analytics tracking. This should include monitoring error logs and ensuring that the event tracking aligns with the current analytics strategy.

- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Create unit tests or manual test scripts that simulate click events on the specified elements and validate that the correct event codes (171 or 172) are dispatched.
  - Test the extension in different browsers to confirm that document delegation and event propagation work as expected given the reliance on legacy ES5 features.

- **Documentation Updates:**  
  Keep this documentation in sync with any code changes. Ensure that any refactoring or additional event binding implementations are well documented for future reference.
