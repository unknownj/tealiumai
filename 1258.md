# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: UTMs

## 1. Extension Overview
- **Name**: UTMs
- **ID**: 1258
- **Type**: Advanced JavaScript Code
- **Scope**: After Load Rules
- **Execution Frequency**: Run Always

### Summary
The UTMs extension is designed to extract UTM parameters from the query string of a URL and map them to specific keys in the Tealium data layer. This allows for enhanced tracking of campaign performance by capturing data such as source, medium, campaign name, term, content, and unique ID. The extension ensures that UTM parameters are consistently available for subsequent analytics and reporting within the Tealium system.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- **`eventType`**: Represents the type of the event triggered within the tracking system (passed as the first argument).
- **`eventPayload` (aliased as `b`)**: An object that holds various key-value pairs representing the data layer, including campaign data.

### Logic Flow
1. The extension defines a function, `getParameterCaseInsensitive`, which retrieves a parameter from the object (`b`) while ignoring case sensitivity.
   - This function uses `Object.keys()` to gather all keys from the object and then filters through them to find a match with the provided key, regardless of case.

2. The extension maps UTM parameters to respective properties in the `eventPayload` object (`b`):
   - **CampaignSource**: Extracted from `qp.utm_source`
   - **CampaignMedium**: Extracted from `qp.utm_medium`
   - **CampaignName**: Extracted from `qp.utm_campaign`
   - **CampaignTerm**: Extracted from `qp.utm_term`
   - **CampaignContent**: Extracted from `qp.utm_content`
   - **CampaignUniqueID**: Extracted from `qp.utm_id`

3. If a UTM parameter already exists in `b`, the existing value remains; otherwise, it is set to the value retrieved from the query parameters.

### Dependencies
- The code is designed to run within the Tealium iQ tag management environment and makes use of the event and payload objects provided by Tealium. There are no external libraries or additional global object dependencies.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Conditions
Assume the URL is:
```
https://example.com?qp.utm_source=google&qp.utm_medium=cpc&qp.utm_campaign=spring_sale
```
After the extension execution:
- `b.CampaignSource` will be set to `"google"`
- `b.CampaignMedium` will be set to `"cpc"`
- `b.CampaignName` will be set to `"spring_sale"`
- Other UTM fields will be undefined if not present in the URL.

### Edge Conditions
1. **No UTM Parameters**: If the URL does not contain any UTM parameters:
   ```
   https://example.com
   ```
   - All the campaign fields in `b` will remain undefined.

2. **Mixed Case Parameters**:
   ```
   https://example.com?QP.UTM_SOURCE=bing&QP.UTM_Medium=email
   ```
   - The parameters are still correctly set, due to the case-insensitivity in the key retrieval.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas
- **Potential Overwrites**: If the UTM parameters are already defined in the `eventPayload` object (`b`), they will not be overwritten. This could lead to inconsistencies if expected values are not updated.
- **Dependency on Query String**: This extension relies solely on the query string format (`qp.utm_*`). If the naming convention changes or if parameters are passed differently, the extension will fail to retrieve those values.
- **Conflict with Other Extensions**: Other extensions may inadvertently overwrite the mapped UTM fields or modify the `eventPayload` object, possibly leading to data loss or inaccuracies.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring
- **Modularisation**: Consider separating the logic of parameter retrieval into a standalone function to improve readability and reusability.
- **Variable Naming**: Use more descriptive variable names to clarify the purpose of each parameter for future developers.
- **Documentation**: Expand inline comments to explain the purpose and expected input/output of functions. For example, document what the `eventPayload` is expected to contain.
- **Use of `hasOwnProperty`**: When setting campaign fields, it may be beneficial to verify that the source exists in the `eventPayload` before reading from it, even though the assumptions state those variables are always present.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes
- **Ownership**: Assign ownership to a specific team or individual to ensure accountability for future updates and maintenance.
- **Testing Guidelines**: Regularly test the extension under various conditions, especially when changes are made to tracking parameters or when new campaigns are launched.
- **Documentation Updates**: Revisit this documentation after major updates or enhancements to ensure it reflects current functionality and usage.
