# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: UTMs

## 1. Extension Overview
- **Name**: UTMs
- **ID**: 1258
- **Type**: Advanced Javascript Code
- **Scope**: After Load Rules
- **Execution Frequency**: Run Always

### Summary
This extension retrieves UTM (Urchin Tracking Module) parameters from the URL's query string, enabling the capture of campaign-related information. It populates specific variables within the `eventPayload` object, facilitating structured tracking of marketing campaigns in analytics tools. By doing so, it provides insights on the effectiveness of different marketing channels, allowing for more informed decision-making.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- `a`: Represents the event type (string) that triggers the extension.
- `b`: Represents the event payload (object), which will hold the UTM parameters.

### Logic Flow
1. The function is immediately invoked with `eventType` and `eventPayload` upon execution.
2. The inner function `getParameterCaseInsensitive` is defined to fetch query parameters from the `eventPayload` object regardless of case sensitivity.
3. The UTM parameters (`utm_source`, `utm_medium`, `utm_campaign`, `utm_term`, `utm_content`, and `utm_id`) are extracted from the `eventPayload` object and assigned to corresponding properties on `b`:
   - `b.CampaignSource`
   - `b.CampaignMedium`
   - `b.CampaignName`
   - `b.CampaignTerm`
   - `b.CampaignContent`
   - `b.CampaignUniqueID`
4. If any UTM parameter is missing, it defaults to an undefined state.

### Dependencies
- The code relies on the `eventPayload` object structure, which is an integral part of the Tealium framework. No external libraries are utilized, and there are no dependencies on global objects.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Condition
Assuming the URL is:
```
http://example.com?qp.utm_source=email&qp.utm_medium=campaign&qp.utm_campaign=spring_sale
```
Upon execution, the `eventPayload` object will be populated as follows:
```javascript
b.CampaignSource = 'email';
b.CampaignMedium = 'campaign';
b.CampaignName = 'spring_sale';
b.CampaignTerm = undefined; // not provided in URL
b.CampaignContent = undefined; // not provided in URL
b.CampaignUniqueID = undefined; // not provided in URL
```

### Edge Condition
If the URL is:
```
http://example.com?utm_source=website&qp.utm_Medium=paid
```
The code will fetch the parameters case-insensitively, resulting in:
```javascript
b.CampaignSource = 'website';
b.CampaignMedium = 'paid';
b.CampaignName = undefined; // not provided in URL
b.CampaignTerm = undefined; // not provided in URL
b.CampaignContent = undefined; // not provided in URL
b.CampaignUniqueID = undefined; // not provided in URL
```

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Missing Parameters**: The extension does not handle scenarios where required parameters are missing; they will simply be set to `undefined`, which might not be ideal for tracking completeness.
- **Case Sensitivity**: While the code handles case insensitivity for UTM parameters, it does not cater to parameters that might have unexpected naming conventions.
- **Performance**: Filtering the keys of an object multiple times might lead to performance issues within extensive event payloads. However, this is unlikely under normal usage conditions.
- **Global Object Dependency**: Though this extension does not specifically depend on any global objects or libraries, modifications or integrations with other extensions could potentially introduce conflicts.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Modularization**: Consider structuring the code to separate the logic for fetching parameters and setting them into a dedicated function. This would enhance readability and maintainability.
  
  Example:
  ```javascript
  function setUTMParameters(sourceObject, targetObject) {
      // set parameters
  }
  ```

- **Parameter Validation**: Introduce validation checks before setting parameters to ensure that they adhere to desired standards (e.g., sanitization).

- **Comments and Documentation**: Expand comments to provide a clearer understanding of the code's intention, particularly for future developers who may inherit or modify this extension.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance**: Regularly review and test this extension as part of broader testing cycles, particularly after changes to URL structures or tagging methodologies.
- **Ownership**: Assign an owner for tracking modifications and updates needed over time.
- **Testing Guidelines**: Conduct rigorous testing for various URL scenarios to ensure robustness, especially focusing on how missing parameters impact data capture.
