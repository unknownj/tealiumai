# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: UTMs

This document provides a comprehensive overview and explanation of the UTMs extension for Tealium iQ. It covers the extension's purpose, code breakdown, usage examples, known limitations, and recommendations for refactoring, along with maintenance guidelines.

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** UTMs  
- **ID:** 1258 (with extension library ID 100040 in metadata)  
- **Type:** Advanced Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** After Load Rules  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Always  

**Summary:**  
The UTMs extension extracts UTM parameters from an incoming object (typically provided as the eventPayload) by performing a case-insensitive search for keys with the format "qp.utm_*". It then populates corresponding properties (e.g. CampaignSource, CampaignMedium) onto the payload if they are not already set. This allows for standardised tracking of campaign-related data regardless of the letter casing used in the source keys.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- **Parameters `a` and `b`:**  
  - `a` represents the event type (e.g. a string identifier).
  - `b` represents the event payload (an object containing various properties, including query parameters that may include UTM information).

- **Function: getParameterCaseInsensitive(object, key)**  
  - **Purpose:** Searches through the keys of the given object in a case-insensitive manner to find a key that matches the provided key.  
  - **Implementation Details:**  
    - Uses `Object.keys(object)` to retrieve an array of the object's keys.
    - Applies `.filter()` with a callback to convert each key to lowercase for comparison with the lowercase version of the provided key.
    - Returns the value associated with the first matching key.
  - **Note:** There is a commented-out variant using `.find()`, but the active code uses `.filter()`, ensuring ES5 compatibility.

### Logic Flow
1. **Retrieving UTM Parameters:**  
   For each UTM parameter (utm_source, utm_medium, utm_campaign, utm_term, utm_content, utm_id), the code checks if the corresponding property exists in the event payload.  
   - If not, it assigns the value returned from `getParameterCaseInsensitive(b, "qp.utm_*")` to the respective property.
   
2. **Campaign Property Assignment:**  
   - **b.CampaignSource:** Populated from "qp.utm_source".
   - **b.CampaignMedium:** Populated from "qp.utm_medium".
   - **b.CampaignName:** Populated from "qp.utm_campaign".
   - **b.CampaignTerm:** Populated from "qp.utm_term".
   - **b.CampaignContent:** Populated from "qp.utm_content".
   - **b.CampaignUniqueID:** Populated from "qp.utm_id".
   
3. **Global Dependencies:**  
   - Relies on the global objects/variables `eventType` and `eventPayload`, which are passed as parameters to the immediately-invoked function expression (IIFE).
   - No third-party libraries are used; only built-in JavaScript functionality is employed.

4. **Developer Comments:**  
   - Includes humorous comments referencing Stackoverflow and the now obsolete Internet Explorer.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Standard UTM Parameters in Lowercase
- **Input Event Payload (b):**
  {
    "qp.utm_source": "google",
    "qp.utm_medium": "cpc",
    "qp.utm_campaign": "summer_sale",
    "qp.utm_term": "sunglasses",
    "qp.utm_content": "ad1",
    "qp.utm_id": "123"
  }
- **Behaviour:**  
  The function will populate `b.CampaignSource` as "google", `b.CampaignMedium` as "cpc", and so on with the respective values.  
- **Outcome:**  
  Each campaign property is set accordingly allowing downstream processes to utilise standardised campaign identifiers.

### Scenario 2: UTM Parameters with Mixed Case Keys
- **Input Event Payload (b):**
  {
    "QP.UTM_Source": "bing",
    "qP.utm_Medium": "organic",
    "qp.UTM_Campaign": "winter_sale"
  }
- **Behaviour:**  
  The case-insensitive search in `getParameterCaseInsensitive` will correctly match these keys regardless of their casing.  
- **Outcome:**  
  - `b.CampaignSource` is set to "bing".
  - `b.CampaignMedium` is set to "organic".
  - `b.CampaignName` is set to "winter_sale".

### Scenario 3: Edge Condition – Missing UTM Parameters
- **Input Event Payload (b):**
  {
    "some_other_key": "value"
  }
- **Behaviour:**  
  Since there are no keys matching the names "qp.utm_source" etc., the helper function returns `undefined` for each missing key.
- **Outcome:**  
  The campaign properties remain either unchanged if already set or end up as `undefined`.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Missing or Undefined Keys:**  
  - If no matching key is found in the event payload object, the respective campaign property will be set to `undefined`. This might require special handling downstream if undefined values are not acceptable.

- **First-Match Only:**  
  - The function will only pick the first key found after filtering. If the payload erroneously contains multiple variants of the same UTM parameter with different casings, only the first one (in the order returned by Object.keys) gets used.

- **Potential Conflicts:**  
  - Other Tealium extensions or scripts that manipulate the same campaign properties (CampaignSource, CampaignMedium, etc.) need to be carefully managed to avoid overwriting values or unexpected side effects.
  
- **IE-Specific Considerations:**  
  - The code includes tongue-in-cheek commentary regarding Internet Explorer. While the code is ES5 compliant, testing in older environments should be performed if IE support is critical.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks (Within ES5 Constraints):**  
  - Although it is assumed that `eventType` and `eventPayload` will always be provided, consider adding checks to validate that the `object` parameter for `getParameterCaseInsensitive` is indeed an object to prevent runtime errors in unexpected situations.

- **Code Modularity:**  
  - If similar logic for case-insensitive parameter retrieval is required elsewhere, consider extracting `getParameterCaseInsensitive` into a shared utility module within your Tealium implementations.

- **Comments and Documentation:**  
  - While the current comments provide some context, additional in-line documentation explaining the purpose of key operations and the decision behind the filtering logic would make the code easier to maintain.

- **Handling Multiple Matches:**  
  - In situations where multiple similarly named keys might exist, consider strategies for resolving conflicts or logging a warning to indicate ambiguous data.

- **Consistent Naming Conventions:**  
  - Ensure that all keys and variables follow a consistent naming style to help future developers quickly understand their purpose.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Create unit tests to simulate various payload inputs (e.g. correct parameters, mixed-case keys, missing parameters) to ensure the function behaves as expected.
  - Consider regression testing whenever changes are made to ensure backward compatibility.

- **Ownership and Versioning:**  
  - Document the version history of this extension so that changes and improvements are clearly tracked over time.
  - Designate a responsible developer or team for monitoring and updating the extension code according to evolving requirements or bug reports.

- **Future Enhancements:**  
  - As Tealium and other data management requirements evolve, keep an eye on opportunities to integrate robust error logging and potentially more versatile parsing logic.
  - Regularly review dependencies and the broader ecosystem of your analytics implementations to determine if improvements can be made.
