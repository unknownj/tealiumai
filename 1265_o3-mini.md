# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: OBK Fixes (OLD JS)

This document provides a comprehensive overview, code explanation, usage examples, known limitations, recommendations for refactoring, and maintenance notes for the OBK Fixes (OLD JS) extension.

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** OBK Fixes (OLD JS)
- **ID:** 1265 (Extension Identifier) / 100036 (Library/Extension group Id)
- **Type:** Javascript Code
- **Scope:** After Load Rules
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Always

### Summary
This extension is designed to normalise the value of the "ProductGroup" property within the event payload. It inspects the "ProductGroup" property within the event data (passed as the object "b", representing eventPayload) and converts specific lower-case strings to a standardised format:
- If the value is "car finance", it is changed to "CarFinance".
- If the value is "credit cards" or "creditcard", it is changed to "CreditCards".

The primary objective is to ensure that product group values follow a consistent naming convention before any further processing or data mapping occurs downstream.

---

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- **a (eventType):** Represents the event type. Though passed into the function, it is not utilised within the logic.
- **b (eventPayload):** An object that contains the event data, including the "ProductGroup" property.

### Logic Flow
1. **Check Existence of ProductGroup:**  
   The code first determines if the "ProductGroup" property exists on the eventPayload (object "b").

2. **Normalise "ProductGroup" Value:**  
   If "ProductGroup" is present, it is converted to lower case for comparison.
   - If it matches "car finance", the value is reassigned to "CarFinance".
   - If it matches "credit cards", it is reassigned to "CreditCards".
   - If it matches "creditcard", it is also reassigned to "CreditCards".

### Dependencies on Global Objects or Libraries
- The extension relies on two global variables/objects:
  - **eventType:** Passed as the first parameter (although it is not used in the logic).
  - **eventPayload:** Passed as the second parameter, containing the event data structure.
- There are no additional external libraries or dependencies required by this code.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Example 1 – Normal Condition: ProductGroup is "car finance"
- **Input eventPayload:**  
  {  
  ProductGroup: "car finance",  
  otherProperty: "data"  
  }
- **Processing:**  
  The code converts "car finance" (after converting to lower case) to "CarFinance".
- **Output eventPayload:**  
  {  
  ProductGroup: "CarFinance",
  otherProperty: "data"  
  }

### Example 2 – Normal Condition: ProductGroup is "credit cards"
- **Input eventPayload:**  
  {  
  ProductGroup: "credit cards",  
  otherProperty: "data"  
  }
- **Processing:**  
  After evaluating the condition, "credit cards" becomes "CreditCards".
- **Output eventPayload:**  
  {  
  ProductGroup: "CreditCards",
  otherProperty: "data"  
  }

### Example 3 – Edge Condition: ProductGroup already standardised
- **Input eventPayload:**  
  {  
  ProductGroup: "CarFinance",  
  otherProperty: "data"  
  }
- **Processing:**  
  Since the condition only triggers when matching lower-case variations, no change is made.
- **Output eventPayload:**  
  {  
  ProductGroup: "CarFinance",
  otherProperty: "data"  
  }

### Example 4 – Edge Condition: ProductGroup is missing
- **Input eventPayload:**  
  {  
  anotherProperty: "data"  
  }
- **Processing:**  
  The function checks for the existence of "ProductGroup". If absent, no processing occurs.
- **Output eventPayload:**  
  {  
  anotherProperty: "data"  
  }

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Case Sensitivity Prior Conversion:**  
  The logic converts the "ProductGroup" value to lower case for comparison. However, any input already in the correct case (e.g., "CarFinance" or "CreditCards") will not be re-evaluated. Users must ensure that data arriving in unexpected formats is handled appropriately.
  
- **Limited to Specific Strings:**  
  The extension only normalises three specific cases:
  - "car finance"
  - "credit cards"
  - "creditcard"  
  Other potential values (e.g., "CAR FINANCE" without spacing considerations) may not be standardised if not strictly matching these conditions after lower casing.
  
- **No Fallback Mechanism:**  
  For any "ProductGroup" that does not match the predetermined set of conditions, the property remains unaltered. There is no logging, error handling, or feedback to indicate mismatch or transformation issues.

- **Interaction with Other Extensions:**  
  If another extension later modifies the "ProductGroup", this extension’s changes (or lack thereof) might be overwritten or compounded. The order of execution relative to other extensions must be carefully managed.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Modularise the Conversion Logic:**  
  Consider encapsulating the product group normalisation logic in a separate helper function. This allows for easier updates and potential reuse across multiple Tealium extensions.

- **Improve Readability:**  
  Use clearly named temporary variables for the lower cased value of "ProductGroup" to avoid multiple conversions and improve clarity. For example, store the lower cased value in a variable and then perform comparisons.

- **Include Comments for Clarity:**  
  Add inline comments to clarify each conditional check. This will help future maintainers understand the intent behind each transformation.

- **Defensive Checks on Data Types:**  
  While the availability of eventType and eventPayload is guaranteed, and defensive coding on those is not required, consider verifying that "ProductGroup" is a string before invoking toLowerCase() to further safeguard the code in case of unexpected type changes.

- **Consistent Formatting:**  
  Ensure consistent formatting and indentation across the code, especially if additional logic is added in the future.

*Note: Maintain ES5 compatibility by avoiding modern ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) features such as arrow functions, let/const, and template literals.*

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Testing:**  
  Regularly test the extension with a varied set of "ProductGroup" values to ensure that all edge cases are handled as expected. Automated tests using a staging environment can help catch issues early.

- **Ownership & Documentation:**  
  Clearly label this extension’s owner or contact person for future queries. Maintain this documentation in a shared repository (such as GitHub) to allow collaborative improvements.

- **Version Control:**  
  Maintain version histories for the extension, especially if refactoring or additional transformation logic is introduced in future updates.

- **Integration with Other Extensions:**  
  Document how this extension interacts with others in the Tealium ecosystem. Ensure that execution order is explicitly managed to avoid unintended conflicts if multiple extensions modify the same fields.

- **Code Reviews and Audits:**  
  Incorporate this extension into regular code audits and reviews. Peer reviews can help identify opportunities for optimisation and adherence to best practices.
