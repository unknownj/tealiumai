# Sensitive Query Strings Extension Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive overview, code explanation, usage examples, known limitations, recommendations for refactoring, and maintenance notes for the Tealium iQ "Sensitive Query Strings" extension.

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Sensitive Query Strings  
- **ID:** 1266 (Internal Extension ID: 100040)  
- **Type:** Advanced Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** After Load Rules  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Always  

### Summary

The Sensitive Query Strings extension is designed to cleanse the page URL of sensitive query string parameters before any analytics or tracking data is processed. It sanitises the operating parameters by:
- Removing potentially sensitive parameters such as "account", "cardn", "code", "fixedFilter", and "fixedfilter".
- Standardising parameter names to a simple alphabetic string (removing underscores, hyphens, and spaces, and converting to lowercase) for reliable matching.
- Logging the redactions to the console for audit purposes.
- Appending an extra query parameter ("jwr") to the URL that indicates how many parameters were redacted.

This approach helps ensure that sensitive information is not inadvertently passed on to analytics systems.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables and Functions

- **toAlpha(str)**
  - Purpose: Transforms the supplied string by removing underscores, hyphens, and spaces, then converts it to lowercase.
  - Use: Standardises parameter names to facilitate consistent redaction matching.

- **stripSensitive(qry)**
  - Purpose: Processes the query string to remove any query parameters whose "sanitised" names contain any of the designated sensitive substrings.
  - Process:
    1. Verifies that the query string exists and removes the leading '?' if present.
    2. Splits the query string into individual components separated by "&".
    3. For each parameter:
       - Extracts the parameter name (everything before the "=").
       - Uses the toAlpha() function to standardise the parameter name.
       - Compares the cleaned parameter name against an array (redactedParams) containing substrings for sensitive keys.
       - If a match is found, the parameter is not added to the output and a console log is issued.
    4. If one or more parameters are removed, appends an additional parameter ("jwr") that holds the count of redacted parameters.
    5. Reconstructs and returns the cleaned query string with a prepended '?'.

- **s.pageURL**
  - Purpose: Constructs the final URL by concatenating:
    - The protocol from window.location.
    - The canonical domain (if provided, via eventPayload/CentralDomainProd; otherwise, window.location.hostname).
    - The canonical path (if provided, via eventPayload/CanonicalPath; otherwise, window.location.pathname).
    - The redacted query string provided by the stripSensitive function.

### Overall Logic Flow

1. The extension is encapsulated within an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) that accepts two parameters (eventType and eventPayload).
2. The helper function toAlpha is defined for sanitisation purposes.
3. The function stripSensitive is then defined to process and cleanse the query string.
4. The script reconstructs the final URL by combining protocol, domain, path, and the modified query string.
5. The sensitive parameters are redacted, and a console log entry is made whenever a redaction occurs.
6. The final URL is assigned to the variable s.pageURL, ready for downstream analytics usage.

### Dependencies and Global Objects

- **window.location:** Utilised for extracting the current protocol, hostname, pathname, and search/query components.
- **console:** Used for logging actions related to parameter redaction.
- **eventType & eventPayload:** Assumed to be available and passed into the extension; these provide additional context and optional canonical properties (e.g. b.CanonicalDomainProd, b.CanonicalPath).
- **s:** Assumes a global context where s.pageURL can be assigned and later used for further processing.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Example 1: Standard URL with Mixed Parameters

- **Original URL:**  
  https://example.com/page?account=12345&user=joe&cardn=9876543210

- **Processing Details:**
  - "account=12345" and "cardn=9876543210" are identified as sensitive after being normalised.
  - "user=joe" does not match any sensitive criteria and remains.
  - Since two parameters were removed, "jwr=2" is appended to indicate this action.

- **Resulting URL:**  
  https://example.com/page?user=joe&jwr=2

---

### Example 2: URL Without Query Parameters

- **Original URL:**  
  https://example.com/page

- **Processing Details:**
  - No query string is present; the function simply returns an empty query string.
  
- **Resulting URL:**  
  https://example.com/page

---

### Example 3: URL with Only Sensitive Parameters

- **Original URL:**  
  https://example.com/page?code=abc123&fixedFilter=on

- **Processing Details:**
  - Both parameters are recognised as sensitive and redacted.
  - "jwr=2" is appended to reflect that two parameters have been removed.

- **Resulting URL:**  
  https://example.com/page?jwr=2

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- The sanitisation method uses a substring match (indexOf) on the normalised parameter names. This could inadvertently redact parameters that merely contain a sensitive substring but are not sensitive in context.
- The sensitive parameter list (redactedParams) is hardcoded. Any updates to what is considered sensitive require manual modification of this list.
- Only the parameter names are checked; the values are not assessed. In some cases, sensitive data might also lie in the values.
- The code does not include error handling for unexpected or malformed query strings beyond a simple check for an empty string.
- Extensive use of console.log for redaction events may not be ideal in a production environment, especially if logging verbosity is a concern.
- Potential conflicts may occur if other extensions or scripts also modify the URL or handle similar parameter sanitisation, leading to unexpected behaviour.

---

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- Modularise the functions (e.g. place toAlpha and stripSensitive into separate modules or easily testable units) for clarity and easier maintenance.
- Consider improving the matching algorithm to ensure that only full parameter names (or validated keys) are excluded rather than any parameter containing sensitive substrings.
- Cache intermediate results where possible to reduce computational overhead, especially in environments with high page load frequencies.
- Replace or conditionally disable console logging in production environments by introducing a logger utility that can be switched off.
- Externalise the redacted parameter list to a configuration object that could potentially be updated without altering the core extension code.
- Ensure that comprehensive inline comments are present to explain non-obvious logic for future maintainers without introducing any ES6 features (stick with ES5 syntax).

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

### Ongoing Maintenance

- **Testing:**  
  Develop unit tests that include various scenarios (normal, edge cases, and malformed query strings) to verify the sanitisation works as intended.
  
- **Code Reviews:**  
  Regular reviews should be scheduled with the development team to ensure that the list of sensitive parameters remains relevant and that the logic complies with new security or analytics requirements.
  
- **Documentation Updates:**  
  Keep this documentation up-to-date with any changes made to the code. Include changes in sensitive parameter handling or modifications to the URL rebuilding process.

### Ownership

- The extension should have a designated maintainer or team responsible for its oversight. Maintain a changelog documenting all modifications for traceability.
  
### Further Considerations

- Monitor for potential conflicts with other Tealium extensions that manipulate URLs or query strings. Coordination with other teams may be necessary if multiple components interact with the URL.
- Consider periodic security reviews to ensure that no sensitive data is inadvertently captured, especially if new sensitive parameter types are introduced in business requirements.
