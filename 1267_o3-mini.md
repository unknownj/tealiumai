# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: SCEP 404

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the "SCEP 404" Tealium iQ extension, detailing its purpose, code explanation, usage examples, known limitations, recommendations for future refactoring, and maintenance considerations.

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** SCEP 404  
- **ID:** 1267  
- **Extension Type:** Advanced Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** After Load Rules  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Always  

**Summary:**  
The SCEP 404 extension is designed to detect when a webpage indicates a "Page Not Found" (404 error) by inspecting its canonical link. If the canonical link's URL contains the substring “/404.”, the extension triggers a generic error event through the LBGAnalytics system. This facilitates proper tracking and reporting of 404 error pages in analytics systems.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Code Structure & Key Variables

- **Self-Invoking Function:**  
  The extension is wrapped within an immediately-invoked function expression (IIFE) that accepts two parameters (a, b). These represent the global variables `eventType` and `eventPayload` provided by Tealium iQ. Although they are not used within this specific extension, they adhere to a standard template.

- **Global Dependencies:**  
  - **jQuery:** The code uses jQuery to select the `<link rel="canonical">` element.  
  - **LBGAnalytics:** This global object is utilised to log an error event when a 404 page is detected.

### Logical Flow

1. **Select Canonical Link:**  
   The code selects the HTML element using:  
   `$("link[rel=canonical]")`.  
   It then retrieves the `href` attribute of that element.

2. **Error Page Detection:**  
   A conditional check is performed to see if the canonical URL contains the substring "/404.":
   - If `indexOf("/404.")` returns a position greater than 0, it implies that the current page is a 404 error page.
   - Note: The check assumes that the canonical URL always contains some characters before “/404.”; if “/404.” appears at the very start (position 0), this condition would not trigger.

3. **Triggering an Event:**  
   When the check is satisfied, the following call is made:
   `LBGAnalytics.events.genericEvent(180).errorPage("Page Not Found");`  
   This line sends an event (using event code 180) to signal that a 404 error page has been encountered, with the message "Page Not Found".

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Conditions

- **Scenario: Valid Page with 404**  
  - *Input:* A page with a `<link rel="canonical" href="https://www.example.com/404.page.html">`.  
  - *Process:* The extension finds “/404.” in the canonical URL and triggers the analytics event.
  - *Output:* LBGAnalytics records the error event with code 180 and message "Page Not Found".

- **Scenario: Non-404 Page**  
  - *Input:* A page with `<link rel="canonical" href="https://www.example.com/products/page.html">`.  
  - *Process:* The substring “/404.” is not found in the URL.
  - *Output:* No event is triggered, behaviour remains passive.

### Edge Conditions

- **Missing or Modified Canonical Link:**  
  - *Input:* A page where the `<link rel="canonical">` element is missing or the URL is malformed.
  - *Process:* jQuery will return an empty selection, and calling `attr("href")` might return `undefined`.  
  - *Output:* Since the code directly calls `.indexOf("/404.")` without an explicit null-check, execution may result in a runtime error or unexpected behaviour. (Note: Defensive coding for this scenario is not implemented as per current requirements.)

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Dependence on jQuery:**  
  The code relies on jQuery being available on the page. If jQuery is not loaded or is overridden by other scripts, the extension may fail.

- **Assumption on Canonical Link:**  
  The logic assumes that the canonical link is present and that its `href` attribute contains a valid string on all pages.  
  - If the canonical element is missing or malformed, the use of `.indexOf` without verifying the existence of the attribute could lead to errors or unintended behaviour.

- **Substring Matching:**  
  The check searches for “/404.” with the assumption that this pattern unambiguously represents a 404 error page.  
  - Edge cases where the URL structure might vary (e.g. the error code appearing at the start, or different variations like “404error”) may not be detected.

- **Conflict Possibility:**  
  If other Tealium iQ extensions or external scripts also manipulate the canonical link or similar event triggers, there could be unexpected conflicts or duplicate event logging.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks:**  
  Although defensive coding for `eventType` and `eventPayload` is not required, it is advised to verify the presence and validity of the canonical link’s `href` attribute before calling `.indexOf`. Example, adding a check such as:
  ```javascript
  var canonicalUrl = $("link[rel=canonical]").attr("href");
  if (typeof canonicalUrl === "string" && canonicalUrl.indexOf("/404.") > 0) {
      LBGAnalytics.events.genericEvent(180).errorPage("Page Not Found");
  }
  ```
  This enhances robustness without compromising ES5 compatibility.

- **Code Readability:**  
  Consider extracting the error event trigger into a separate function for better modularity, which can ease unit testing and future modifications.

- **Comments and Documentation:**  
  Adding inline comments detailing the logic and expected outcomes will aid future developers in understanding the flow and purpose of the code.

- **Consistent Use of Variables:**  
  Since `a` and `b` are not used in the extension’s core logic, consider renaming them to more meaningful parameter names (if possible within the constraints) to reflect their role.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  - It is recommended to periodically verify that the assumptions made about the canonical URL structure (specifically the “/404.” substring) remain valid as site URL structures evolve.
  - Ensure that global dependencies (jQuery and LBGAnalytics) remain available and are not subject to conflicting updates.

- **Ownership:**  
  - Assign a team member or a group responsible for tracking error handling and analytics events.  
  - Maintain a revision log to record any changes made to the extension code.

- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Implement unit tests or manual tests on pages with both valid and missing canonical links.  
  - Monitor analytics to ensure that error events are correctly logged during each version update.

- **Future Extensions:**  
  - If site navigation or URL patterns change, additional conditions or variation in the pattern matching logic might be required.  
  - If new analytics services or event triggers are introduced, consider abstracting the analytics event trigger to support multiple backends.
