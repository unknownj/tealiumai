# Pegasus Tag Title Extension Documentation

This document covers the details of the Tealium iQ extension named “Pegasus Tag Title”. It explains the extension’s functionality, the code logic, usage examples, limitations, and recommendations for future refactoring and maintenance.

---

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Pegasus Tag Title  
- **Extension ID:** 1270  
- **Library Extension ID:** 100040  
- **Type:** Advanced Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** Before Load Rules  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Always  

**Summary:**  
This extension builds a custom tag string by aggregating and mapping various data layer variables. It handles brand, product group, page role, and application state information, applying specific mapping rules to correct and standardise incoming values. The extension also implements special considerations for certain journey names to construct a "friendly" tag name. This processing ensures consistency in reported tag values for analytics and reporting purposes.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables and Global Dependencies

- **Input Variables:**  
  - `b`: Represents the event payload (data layer object) used for reading and setting values.
  - `utag.data`: Global Tealium object to store data layer values.
  - `clova3.datalayer`: External global object used for retrieving and setting data variables.
  - `eventType`: Unused parameter but guaranteed to be present.
  - `eventPayload`: Unused parameter in the immediate code, but passed in as part of the Tealium extension context.
  
- **Local Variables:**  
  - `tag_structure`: An array that defines the order and allowed values (with mapping rules) for constructing the final tag string.
  - `op`: An array that collects individual tag components which will then be concatenated with a " | " delimiter.
  - `dl`: Local reference to the current data layer object (alias for `b`).

### Logic Flow

1. **Brand Processing:**
   - Tests the `Brand` property (converted to uppercase) with a regular expression against "LLOYDS", "HALIFAX", "BOS", and "MBNA".
   - For matching brands:  
     - Checks if the `Division` equals "Commercial". If true, concatenates the trimmed brand with the division (e.g. "Lloyds Commercial"), setting both `b["PegasusBrand"]` and `utag.data.PegasusBrand`.
   - Otherwise, the brand is simply trimmed and set (e.g. for Scottish Widows).

2. **Default Variable Assignment:**  
   - For each of the three variables (`PegasusProductGroup`, `PegasusPageRole`, and `PegasusApplicationState`):
     - Checks whether the value is undefined or empty.
     - If so, it assigns their respective fallback values from `ProductGroup`, `PageRole`, or `ApplicationState`.
     - *Note:* There is a potential flaw in the assignment for `PegasusApplicationState` where instead of setting `b["PegasusApplicationState"]` directly, it mistakenly sets `b["PegasusPageRole"]` to `b["ApplicationState"]` after the check.

3. **Tag Structure Construction:**  
   - An array `tag_structure` defines the composition of the final tag with elements:
     - A fixed string ("Pegasus"),
     - Variables for brand, product group, page role, and application state.
   - Each object in the array may contain:  
     - A `string` property – directly added to the output.
     - A `variable` property – references a property from the data layer.
     - An `allowable` list – an array of permitted values.
     - A `map` – an object mapping non-standard values to standard ones.
   - The loop processes each element in this structure:
     - If the element is a string, it is directly added to the output array.
     - If it is a variable, the corresponding value is checked against the allowable list.
       - If the value is valid (or if no allowable list is defined), it is mapped if needed.
       - If not allowed, the placeholder "NA" is inserted.
   
4. **Friendly Name Specialisation:**  
   - For certain `JourneyName` values (e.g. "CreditWorthiness", "ApplyOverdraft", etc.), constructs a friendly tag name with a different combination of tag components.
   - For all others, constructs a friendly name using a default component order.

5. **Final Tag Name Assignment:**
   - Combines all tag components from the `op` array using the delimiter " | " to form `PegasusTagName`.
   - Writes this final tag name back to the data layer using:
     - `b["PegasusTagName"]`
     - `utag.data.PegasusTagName`
     - `clova3.datalayer.set("PegasusTagName", <value>, true)`

### Global Dependencies

- The extension relies on:
  - The global `utag.data` object.
  - The `clova3.datalayer` object (assumed to be part of another integrated library).
  - External variables `eventType` and `eventPayload`, though only `eventPayload` is indirectly referenced through `b`.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Example 1: Standard Brand with Commercial Division

- **Input Data:**
  - Brand: "Lloyds"
  - Division: "Commercial"
  - ProductGroup: "Current Accounts"
  - PageRole: "Homepage"
  - ApplicationState: "Pre-Application"

- **Processing:**
  - `PegasusBrand` becomes "Lloyds Commercial" (brand concatenated with the division).
  - `PegasusProductGroup` remains "Current Accounts" (if valid in allowable, or mapped if required).
  - `PegasusPageRole` is passed through if valid (or mapped as per rules).
  - `PegasusApplicationState` is processed (despite the noted bug, the expected behaviour is to copy "Pre-Application"; note: mapping will convert it to "App Start" based on the map).

- **Output Tag Structure:**  
  For example, the final tag string might be:  
  "Pegasus | Lloyds Commercial | Current Accounts | Homepage | App Start"

### Example 2: Non-Matching Brand (Scottish Widows)

- **Input Data:**
  - Brand: "Scottish Widows"
  - Division: Not applicable (or empty)
  - ProductGroup: "Savings"
  - PageRole: "Brochureware" (which will be mapped to "Landing Page")
  - ApplicationState: "Application" (which, according to the mapping, may be transformed)

- **Processing:**
  - `PegasusBrand` is simply "Scottish Widows" (no division appended).
  - Variables for the product group and page role are set from default values.
  - `PegasusPageRole` ("Brochureware") is mapped to "Landing Page".
  
- **Output Tag Structure:**  
  Expected tag string could be:  
  "Pegasus | Scottish Widows | Savings | Landing Page | App Start"  
  (subject to the mapping of "Application" via the application state map, if applicable)

### Example 3: Edge Case – Missing Values

- **Input Data with Missing Pegasus Variables:**
  - `PegasusProductGroup`, `PegasusPageRole`, or `PegasusApplicationState` are not defined or are empty.
  - Fallbacks will assign values from `ProductGroup`, `PageRole`, and `ApplicationState`.

- **Processing:**
  - The code checks for undefined or empty string values and assigns the fallback.
  - If a value does not appear in the allowable list, it adds "NA" in its place.

- **Output Tag Structure:**
  - The final tag may include "NA" for any component that did not pass the allowable validation.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Potential Bug in Application State Assignment:**  
  - In the condition that checks `PegasusApplicationState`, the code mistakenly assigns the value to `b["PegasusPageRole"]` instead of `b["PegasusApplicationState"]` after checking for undefined or empty. This might lead to unexpected overwriting of the page role.

- **Case Sensitivity and Allowable List Issues:**
  - The allowable lists are case sensitive in most cases. While mapping handles some variations (e.g. "Lloyds" vs "lloyds"), inconsistent casing may still cause disallowed values and result in "NA" being inserted.

- **Dependence on Global Objects:**
  - The code relies on external objects (`utag.data` and `clova3.datalayer`). Any changes or removal of these objects in the broader Tealium setup could break the extension.

- **Mapping Overhead:**
  - The extension uses repeated logic for reading data from the data layer and writing back mapped values, which could lead to maintenance challenges if the data model changes.

- **JourneyName Special Case:**
  - The friendly name construction logic is hard-coded for specific journey names. Future changes to journey names require updating the code.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Improve Variable Assignment Logic:**
  - Correct the bug in the assignment for `PegasusApplicationState` so that `b["PegasusApplicationState"]` is set properly rather than overwriting `b["PegasusPageRole"]`.

- **Modularise Code Segments:**
  - Extract mapping logic into separate helper functions to reduce redundancy and improve readability.
  - Consider a function for:
    - Validating and mapping data layer variables.
    - Constructing the final tag structure from an array.

- **Defensive Checks:**
  - Although the availability of `eventType` and `eventPayload` is guaranteed, ensure that related global objects (e.g. `utag.data` and `clova3.datalayer`) exist before usage to further encapsulate the extension’s reliability.

- **Code Style and Commenting:**
  - Add inline comments explaining the rationale behind each major block of logic.
  - Maintain consistent formatting and spacing for better readability.

- **Data-Driven Configuration:**
  - Consider externalising the allowable lists and mapping objects. This makes future updates easier without modifying the code.

- **ES5 Compatibility:**
  - All refactoring should adhere to ES5 syntax. Avoid modern ES2015/ES6 syntax elements such as arrow functions, template literals, or block-scoped variables (`let`/`const`). Use `var` for variable declarations.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Testing:**
  - Create unit tests based on sample input/output scenarios. Validate that each field gets mapped correctly and that edge cases (e.g. missing or disallowed values) are handled as expected.

- **Ownership:**
  - Clearly define team members responsible for this extension so that any required modifications or updates can be coordinated efficiently.

- **Documentation Updates:**
  - Keep this documentation in sync with any changes in data layer schema or mapping rules.
  
- **Monitoring & Logging:**
  - Consider adding logging (if permitted) for debugging purposes, particularly to capture when unrecognised values are encountered.

- **Impact Assessment:**
  - Any modifications should be tested in a development environment and validated across all dependent systems (Tealium tags, integrated reporting, etc.) before deploying to production.

- **Version Control:**
  - Tag and version the extension within the Tealium iQ environment. Maintain a changelog for future troubleshooting and audits.
