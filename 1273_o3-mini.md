# Tealium iQ Extension: ADA : Config and DoPlugins Documentation

This documentation provides an in-depth overview of the "ADA : Config and DoPlugins" extension, including its purpose, code breakdown, usage scenarios, known limitations, refactoring recommendations, and maintenance guidelines.

---

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** ADA : Config and DoPlugins  
- **ID:** 1273  
- **Extension Type:** Advanced Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** 928  
- **Execution Frequency:** Executed per event (via the IIFE wrapper at runtime)

**Summary:**  
This extension configures key settings for an Adobe Analytics (AppMeasurement) implementation via Tealium iQ. It sets up parameters such as the cookie domain, cookie domain periods, and first party cookie domain periods based on the current hostname. Additionally, it initialises the use of plugins by defining a designated function (s_doPlugins) which can be extended with additional logic. Some configuration aspects (like AppMeasurement initialisation, Visitor ID Service, and Tracking Server settings) are dynamically set in Tealium Tag Configuration rather than within this code.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Structure & Flow

- **IIFE Wrapper:**  
  The entire code is encapsulated within an Immediately Invoked Function Expression that accepts three parameters:
  - `a` (likely representing the event type),
  - `b` (likely representing the event payload), and
  - `u` (likely representing the tag object).

- **Sectioned Comments:**  
  The code is divided into logical sections marked by comments:
  - **AppMeasurement Initialise:** (Configured externally via Tealium Tag Configuration)
  - **Visitor ID Service Config:** (Configured externally via Tealium Tag Configuration)
  - **AppMeasurement Config:**  
    - Sets the cookie domain to the current hostname.
    - Defines the default cookie domain periods as "2".
    - For hostnames containing “.co.uk”, upgrades the cookie domain periods to "3".
    - Repeats a similar process for the first party cookie (fpCookieDomainPeriods).
  - **DoPlugins:**  
    - Enables plugin usage (`s.usePlugins = true`)
    - Defines the `s_doPlugins` function that can be utilised to modify events (e.g. appending events or performing other operations).
    - Assigns `s.doPlugins` to reference the newly defined function.
  - **Tracking Server and Plugins Section:**  
    - These sections note that further configuration is done externally or via other Tealium extensions (e.g. "ADA : Plugins and Modules").

### Key Variables & Logic Details

- **Global Variables & Dependencies:**  
  - The script relies on a global object `s` (commonly used in Adobe Analytics implementations) to hold the configuration variables.
  - The values for `window.location.hostname` are used to determine which cookie settings to apply.

- **Cookie Domain Settings:**  
  - `s.cookieDomain` is set to the current hostname (window.location.hostname).
  - `s.cookieDomainPeriods` is set based on whether the hostname contains ".co.uk":
    - Defaults to "2"
    - Changes to "3" if ".co.uk" is detected.
  - Similar logic is applied for `s.fpCookieDomainPeriods`.

- **Plugin Code Execution:**  
  - `s.usePlugins` ensures that any defined plugins are active.
  - The `s_doPlugins` function is defined as a shell for future plugin operations (e.g. appending to the event list). This function is then assigned to `s.doPlugins` to be executed during the tracking process.

- **External Dependencies:**  
  - The extension expects configuration settings (for AppMeasurement initialise, Visitor ID Service, and Tracking Server) to be injected via Tealium Tag Configuration.
  - It is dependent on the global `s` object provided by Adobe Analytics or by Tealium’s integration libraries.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Example Scenario 1: Standard Domain

- **Input:**  
  - Hostname: www.example.com  
  - An event triggers the extension (e.g. page view or click).

- **Behaviour:**  
  - The script sets `s.cookieDomain` to "www.example.com".
  - Since the hostname does not contain ".co.uk", `s.cookieDomainPeriods` and `s.fpCookieDomainPeriods` remain as "2".
  - `s.usePlugins` is set to true and the `s_doPlugins` function is ready for any additional plugin logic.

### Example Scenario 2: .co.uk Domain

- **Input:**  
  - Hostname: www.example.co.uk  
  - An event triggers the extension.

- **Behaviour:**  
  - The script sets `s.cookieDomain` to "www.example.co.uk".
  - The condition `if(d.indexOf(".co.uk") > 0)` returns true, so:
    - `s.cookieDomainPeriods` is set to "3".
    - Similarly, `s.fpCookieDomainPeriods` is adjusted to "3".
  - The plugin initialisation remains unchanged.

### Edge Conditions

- **Incorrect Hostname Format:**  
  - If the hostname does not follow expected patterns, the cookie domain and the period settings could default incorrectly.
- **Interference from Other Extensions:**  
  - If another extension modifies the global `s` object or the same properties concurrently, there may be unintended side effects.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Reliance on External Configuration:**  
  - The extension depends on external Tealium Tag Configuration for initialising certain parameters (e.g. AppMeasurement initialise and Tracking Server). Misconfiguration externally can affect overall behaviour.
  
- **Multiple Extensions Accessing Global `s`:**  
  - Since the extension modifies global variables (`s`), conflicts might occur if other extensions or scripts attempt to override the same properties.
  
- **Limited Error Handling:**  
  - The code does not handle error conditions for accessing `window.location.hostname` or potential undefined objects.
  
- **Repetitive Code:**  
  - The logic for setting cookie domain periods is repeated for both cookie types, making future modifications susceptible to errors if the logic needs updating.

---

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Consolidate Repeated Logic:**  
  - Abstract the repeated code for setting cookie domain periods (for both the primary and first party cookies) into a helper function. This improves maintainability and reduces duplication.
  
  Example (in ES5):
  
  /*  
  function setCookieDomainPeriods(host, defaultPeriods) {  
      return host.indexOf(".co.uk") > 0 ? "3" : defaultPeriods;  
  }  
  s.cookieDomainPeriods = setCookieDomainPeriods(window.location.hostname, "2");  
  s.fpCookieDomainPeriods = setCookieDomainPeriods(window.location.hostname, "2");  
  */
  
- **Defensive Checks for Global `s`:**  
  - Although `eventType` and `eventPayload` are guaranteed, it would be beneficial to include a defensive check for the global `s` object before modifying its properties.
  
- **Code Comments and Documentation:**  
  - Increase inline comments to ensure developers understand the reasons for specific logic, such as why ".co.uk" domains require a different cookie domain period.
  
- **Modularisation:**  
  - Consider modularising portions of the code if multiple similar extensions exist. This helps to standardise cookie settings across different implementations.
  
- **Maintain ES5 Compatibility:**  
  - Continue using `var` for variable declarations and avoid ES6 constructs as required.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  - Ensure that any changes in the external configuration (via Tealium Tag Configuration) are reflected in the extension documentation.
  - Keep track of changes to the global Adobe Analytics (or `s` object) specifications that might influence this code.

- **Ownership and Versioning:**  
  - Assign an owner or maintenance team responsible for the extension.  
  - Maintain a version history or changelog within the documentation.

- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Develop unit tests that simulate various hostname inputs (e.g. standard domains vs. `.co.uk` domains) to verify cookie domain and period settings.
  - Include tests to ensure that the `s_doPlugins` function executes without errors and integrates well with any additional plug-in code.

- **Collaboration and Code Reviews:**  
  - Regular code reviews are recommended to ensure the extension adheres to the latest best practices and organisational coding standards.
  - Collaborate with stakeholders (e.g. analytics teams) to ensure the configurations align with broader digital strategy requirements.
