# Tealium iQ Extension: ADA : Technical Debt Cleanup

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** ADA : Technical Debt Cleanup  
- **ID:** 1275  
- **Extension ID:** 100040  
- **Type:** Advanced Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** 928  
- **Execution Frequency:** Executes on every data layer event page load based on Tealium iQ rules (typically once per page load unless configured differently)

**Summary:**  
This extension consolidates several Adobe Analytics extensions into one centralised piece. Its main purpose is to perform a series of technical debt cleanups and data validations by processing data layer variables, firing events via LBGAnalytics, validating and normalising variable formats, handling journey and campaign mappings, and ensuring sensitive data (PII) is redacted where needed. It also dynamically adjusts the Adobe Analytics account and reporting suite based on the current environment (production vs. test).

## 2. Code Explanation

### Global Variables & Dependencies

- **a, b, u:**  
  - `a` (eventType): A string describing the event type.
  - `b` (eventPayload): An object containing data layer variables.
  - `u` (tagObject): An object used for utilities such as adding events.
  
- **Other Global Objects:**  
  - `s`: Typically represents the Adobe Analytics object for setting the account.
  - `utag`: The Tealium universal tag object.
  - `LBGAnalytics`: Custom global object used for firing generic events and storing event data.
  - `window.LBGAnalytics.data.validationList`: A list containing validation rules for various data layer variables.

### Logic Flow & Key Processing Blocks

1. **Firing Generic Events:**  
   - The code starts by firing a generic event (e.g. event 651) using `LBGAnalytics.events.genericEvent` within a try-catch. Additional similar calls are placed throughout the code to capture actions like mapping question/answer pairs or redacting PII (e.g. events 652, 653, 654).

2. **RetailCustomerID Length Check:**  
   - Checks if `RetailCustomerID` exists as a string and exceeds 100 characters. If so, it deletes this variable from the payload to prevent unwanted data.

3. **Environment & Domain Detection:**  
   - A list of development and test domains is examined (e.g. "localhost", ".test.", "staging.service.group").
   - Flags the execution context as test if the hostname matches any of those domains or if the `b.Platform` or `b["ut.env"]` is not production.
   - For non-test contexts, the Adobe Analytics `s.account` (and optionally `u.o.account`) is set to the production account value, “lloydsbankinggroupprod”.
  
4. **Adobe Analytics ReportSuite Override:**  
   - If the `ReportSuiteOverride` is defined and starts with “lloydsbankinggroup”, then it overrides the account value in `s.account`.

5. **Core Data Layer Validations:**  
   - A helper function `simplify` is defined to lower-case strings and remove non-alphanumeric characters.
   - The code iterates over a `validationList` (from `window.LBGAnalytics.data.validationList`) to validate or reformat variables. Validation rules can be provided as arrays, objects, or functions.
   - Any failures are stored in a `failedRules` array which is then joined and appended to the `CustomList` variable.

6. **Aries Error Pages Handling:**  
   - Checks for error-related variables (`ErrorMessageSystem`, `ErrorMessage`, `ErrorMessageID`), and if found, modifies journey-related variables to note an error state.

7. **CLOVA Events & Variable Mapping:**  
   - Iterates over `LBGAnalytics.events.eventQueue` and maps events to Adobe event codes using a prefix “aa.”.
   - Similar logic is applied for related variables stored in `LBGAnalytics.events.relatedVariables`.

8. **Link Events & QA Mapping:**  
   - Maps values from `LinkValue`, `WTP:WT.ac`, `QAQuestion`, and `QAAnswer`.
   - Additionally, if both `EventValue` and `EventNarrative` are provided, they are mirrored to `QAQuestion` and `QAAnswer`.

9. **Authentication & Journey Fixes:**  
   - If `RetailCustomerID` and `SessionID` are present, the extension maps the session as “Internet Banking” and fires an authentication event.
   - The code identifies and reformats page names, canonical paths, and journey names and products based on preset rules and URL queries.
   - It includes special handling for mortgage journeys, including appending a “PT” suffix if a specific query parameter is detected.

10. **Privacy Manager, Cookie, and Version Fixes:**  
    - Ensures that canonical domain and presentation family values are set.
    - Computes a shortened session ID based on a special cookie (`cp.TBMCookie`) using a SHA256 hash function.
    - Constructs a full Tealium version string from several version components.
    - Updates cookie consent values (e.g. `CookiesFunctional`) from boolean flags to strings (“Allowed” or “No Consent”).

11. **Marketing Tracking & Campaign Mapping:**  
    - Parses URL query strings for specific parameters (e.g. `wt.srch`, `wt.ac=`) and maps these values to marketing variables such as `CampaignMedium`, `CampaignSource`, and `LegacyCampaignCode`.
    - Adjusts tracking information depending on campaign names (e.g. Email Marketing, DirectMail, Aggregators).

12. **Link & Impression Event Logic:**  
    - Checks certain conditions on `LinkValue` and `ConsolidatedImpressions` and fires Adobe events (event71 or event72) as required.

13. **Journey Cleanup & Form Input Mapping:**  
    - Tidies up values by removing redundant text (e.g. “step” from `JourneyStep` values) and creating a graduated naming convention for journey steps.
    - When form inputs (EventValue/ EventNarrative) are detected, and all preconditions are met, the extension mirrors these into QA variables.
    - Implements a final line of defence for Personal Identifiable Information (PII) by redacting answers based on a list of sensitive phrases.

### Dependencies & Global Objects

- Relies on the existence of:
  - Global objects: `LBGAnalytics`, `s` (Adobe Analytics), `utag`, and `window`.
  - Data structure: `window.LBGAnalytics.data.validationList` which should be pre-defined.
  - Utility functions: e.g. SHA256 method from `utag.ut.sha256`.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Production Environment without Test Flags

- If the website hostname does not match any development or test domains,
- And if the `b.Platform` is not “test” and `b["ut.env"]` equals “prod”:
  - The code sets `s.account` to “lloydsbankinggroupprod”.
  - Any Adobe Analytics related overrides are enforced.
  - Validations are applied to core data layer variables.
  - Marketing campaign variables are mapped correctly based on URL parameters.

### Scenario 2: RetailCustomerID Validation

- If a data layer variable `RetailCustomerID` exists as a string longer than 100 characters:
  - The extension will delete the variable from the payload.
  - This prevents potentially invalid or malicious data being sent downstream.

### Scenario 3: Journey and Campaign Mapping

- If the data layer provides journey variables (e.g. `JourneyName`, `JourneyProduct`, etc.) and URL contains specific query strings (e.g. "at=pt"):
  - The extension amends the journey name (appending “PT”) and maps the journey product to a recognisable value such as "First Time Buyer" or "Home Mover".
  
### Scenario 4: PII Handling on Form Input

- When both `EventValue` and `EventNarrative` are present:
  - They are mirrored into QA variables.
  - A list of problematic keywords is employed to inspect the question.
  - If a sensitive keyword (e.g., “creditcard” or “password”) is found, the corresponding answer is replaced with “(Redacted)” to protect PII.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- Many operations are enclosed in try-catch blocks that silently fail. This makes debugging more complex if some functionality does not work as expected.
- The extension depends heavily on the structure and existence of several global objects (`LBGAnalytics`, `utag`, `s`). If these objects are not fully initialised or configured, certain functionalities might not run.
- The validation process in the core data layer may overwrite values in a way that might be unexpected if the input data format deviates from the assumed standards.
- Overlapping conditions in journey or campaign mapping could result in unintended data layer modifications, especially when similar keywords or URL query parameters are present.
- Some variables (e.g. `CustomList`) are constructed cumulatively and might grow over time if not reset between page loads.
- There is an assumed order of execution—dependent data layer variables must be initialised before this extension runs.

---

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- Modularise the code by separating different processing blocks (e.g. environment detection, data layer validations, journey mapping) into individual functions. This would improve readability and maintainability.
- Extract common helper functions such as the `simplify` function and the SHA256 call into a shared utility module.
- Consider additional logging or error reporting (while adhering to privacy standards) to capture when try-catch blocks intercept failures.
- Consolidate repeated try-catch blocks where sensible, or employ a wrapper function to execute blocks of code and log any errors.
- Maintain existing ES5 coding style, but adopt consistent indentation and comment styles to ensure that future developers can readily follow the logic and dependencies.
- Review the merge/concatenation logic for `CustomList` to ensure duplicate errors or unwanted growing lists do not occur.
- Validate and document assumptions about global data structures such as `LBGAnalytics.data.validationList` for easier future enhancements.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**
  - Regularly check the list of test domains and environment conditions to ensure they remain current with the infrastructure.
  - Monitor the output of data layer validations and campaign mappings as website content and marketing strategies evolve.
  - Add unit tests for critical helper functions (like `simplify`) and for key processing paths to quickly identify any regression or issues after changes.
  
- **Ownership & Testing Guidelines:**
  - Assign a dedicated owner (or team) for the extension who is responsible for validating its accuracy after each Tealium platform update.
  - Use a staging environment to test any modifications before deploying to production.
  - Document any changes to global data structures and validate that downstream systems (Adobe Analytics, privacy tools, etc.) receive the correct variable mappings.
  - Consider adding inline documentation for complex logic or potential gotchas in the code to assist future developers.

- **Further Notes:**
  - Since the extension uses multiple global objects and silently fails on errors, ensure monitoring tools are in place that can alert developers to unexpected behavior.
  - Verify that any third-party libraries (such as SHA256) are up-to-date and compatible with the ES5 standard.
