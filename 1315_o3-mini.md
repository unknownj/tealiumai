# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: "Misc Bits for other places"

This document provides an in-depth explanation of the "Misc Bits for other places" extension developed for Tealium iQ. It covers an overview of the extension’s purpose, a detailed code explanation, usage examples, known limitations, refactoring recommendations, and maintenance guidelines.

---

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Misc Bits for other places  
- **Extension ID:** 100040 (extension) / 1315 (instance)  
- **Extension Type:** Advanced Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** After Load Rules  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Always

**Summary:**  
This extension is designed to augment the event payload with additional properties. Specifically, it adds two timestamp properties (one as a standard millisecond value and the other in a base36 string format) and extracts a cookie value (referred to as "FirstPartyCookie") from the browser’s cookie string, based on specific key patterns ("MCMID%7C" or "MCMID|"). This functionality can be used for subsequent tracking or processing steps in Tealium iQ.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables and Parameters

- **a (eventType):**  
  A parameter representing the type of event; declared as the first argument. Although present as an identifier, it is not manipulated within the code.

- **b (eventPayload):**  
  A parameter representing the event payload object. The extension adds or modifies properties on this object.

- **b.Timestamp:**  
  This property is set to the current time in milliseconds since the Unix epoch using the `Date` object.

- **b.Timestamp36:**  
  This property stores the base36 string representation of the current time, derived by converting the millisecond timestamp via `toString(36)`.

- **b.FirstPartyCookie:**  
  This property is conditionally set by examining the browser’s document cookies. It is only modified if not already set. The extraction uses two key patterns:
  - "MCMID%7C" when URL-encoded delimiters are present
  - "MCMID|" when the cookies are in a straight pipe-delimited format

### Logic Flow

1. **Timestamp Assignment:**  
   - The extension immediately assigns two timestamp values to the eventPayload:
     - `b.Timestamp`: A direct millisecond count.
     - `b.Timestamp36`: The base36 representation of the millisecond count.

2. **Cookie Processing (Inside a try-catch block):**  
   - The code converts `document.cookie` to a string (`cookieString`).
   - It then checks if the eventPayload (`b`) already contains a `FirstPartyCookie` property:
     - **If present:** No further processing is done.
   - If `FirstPartyCookie` is not already present:
     - **First Condition:**  
       - If `cookieString` contains `"MCMID%7C"`, the code:
         - Splits the string based on `"MCMID%7C"`, takes the second segment, and then splits it again at `"%7C"` to extract the cookie value.
     - **Second Condition:**  
       - If the first condition fails but `cookieString` contains `"MCMID|"`, a similar split is performed using `"MCMID|"` and `"|"` as delimiters.
     - **Else Block:**  
       - If none of the expected cookie markers are present, no action is taken.
   - **Error Handling:**  
     - Any exceptions encountered in processing the cookie are caught silently, ensuring that a failure to retrieve or parse the cookie does not disrupt the extension workflow.

### Dependencies

- **Global Objects and Methods:**  
  - `Date`: For retrieving the current time.
  - `document.cookie`: For accessing the cookie string from the browser.
  - Standard JavaScript string manipulation methods (`indexOf`, `split`, `toString`).

- **Tealium iQ Provided Variables:**  
  - `eventType` and `eventPayload` are assumed to be global to the extension and are passed as function arguments.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Scenario

1. **Event Trigger:**  
   A tracking event is fired, and the extension is executed with `eventType` (as a string) and `eventPayload` (an object).

2. **Timestamp Assignment:**  
   - The extension attaches a millisecond timestamp to `eventPayload.Timestamp`.
   - It also adds the base36 representation as `eventPayload.Timestamp36`.

3. **Cookie Extraction:**  
   - Assume the browser cookie is:
     
     "somevalue=123; MCMID%7Cabc123%7Cotherinfo"
     
   - The code looks for "MCMID%7C" in the cookie string, extracts "abc123", and sets `eventPayload.FirstPartyCookie` to that value.

### Edge Conditions

- **FirstPartyCookie Already Set:**  
  If `eventPayload.FirstPartyCookie` already exists, the cookie extraction logic is bypassed, and no further processing of cookies occurs.

- **Cookie Format Variation:**  
  - If the cookie exists in the alternate format:  
    "somevalue=123; MCMID|xyz789|otherinfo"  
    the extension detects the "MCMID|" pattern, extracts "xyz789", and sets `eventPayload.FirstPartyCookie`.
    
- **Cookie Not Found:**  
  If neither "MCMID%7C" nor "MCMID|" patterns are detected in the cookie string, then `eventPayload.FirstPartyCookie` remains unchanged.

- **Error in Cookie Processing:**  
  If any error occurs (for example, a malformed cookie string), the try-catch block prevents the error from interrupting the event flow.

---

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Cookie Pattern Reliance:**  
  - The logic specifically searches for "MCMID%7C" and "MCMID|". If the cookie format changes or if there are additional encodings, the extraction method may fail, leaving `FirstPartyCookie` unset.
  
- **Silent Error Handling:**  
  - Errors encountered during cookie processing are caught silently. This may make debugging more difficult if cookies are not being set as expected.
  
- **Global Impact:**  
  - As the extension operates on a global `eventPayload` object, there is a potential risk of conflicts if another extension also manipulates the `FirstPartyCookie` property.

- **Duplicate Date Object Creation:**  
  - The current implementation creates two separate `Date` objects for the timestamp, which could be optimised by reusing a single instance.

---

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Optimise Date Instantiation:**  
  - Create a single `Date` object instance and reuse it for both `Timestamp` and `Timestamp36` to reduce redundancy.
  
  Example:
  // Defining a variable for date might help:
  // var currentDate = new Date();
  // b.Timestamp = currentDate.getTime();
  // b.Timestamp36 = currentDate.getTime().toString(36);

- **Enhance Cookie Extraction Logic:**  
  - Consider refactoring the cookie parsing into a separate helper function. This would not only improve readability but also facilitate unit testing on the cookie extraction logic.

- **Logging and Debugging:**  
  - Although error handling is important, consider logging errors (or at least a notification in a debug environment) to assist in troubleshooting cookie extraction issues without affecting production performance.

- **Modularisation for Readability:**  
  - Breaking the code into smaller functions or clearly commented blocks can enhance maintainability, especially as new criteria for cookie extraction might be added in the future.

- **Code Comments and Documentation:**  
  - Ensure inline comments are present to clearly explain each major step, especially within the try-catch block and conditional logic.

Note: All suggestions should maintain ES5 compatibility. Avoid using modern syntax enhancements such as arrow functions, template literals, or block-scoped variables (let/const).

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  - Regularly review browser cookie formats and update the cookie parsing logic if required.
  - Monitor the performance effect on event processing, particularly if additional cookie patterns or new data extraction requirements are introduced.

- **Ownership and Versioning:**  
  - Assign clear ownership for the extension. Include version numbers in the documentation and maintain a change log with details of updates or bugfixes.

- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Develop unit tests for the cookie extraction logic using various cookie formats.
  - Validate that timestamps are correctly calculated and formatted.
  - Test the extension within the Tealium environment to ensure that it does not conflict with other extensions or external scripts.

- **Collaboration and Peer Reviews:**  
  - Encourage code reviews and collaborative tests with other developers to catch any edge cases that might not be immediately apparent.
