# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation

## 1. Extension Overview 
- **Name**: LivePerson Section ID  
- **ID**: 1320  
- **Type**: Advanced Javascript Code  
- **Scope**: Before Load Rules  
- **Execution Frequency**: Run Always  

**Summary**:  
This extension processes the web page's canonical path and various brand-related attributes to construct a unique `SectionID`. The `SectionID` serves as an identifier for different sections within the website, helping to customise user experiences or collect analytics data. The primary objective is to ensure that the `SectionID` captures relevant contextual information based on the user's journey through the website.

## 2. Code Explanation 

### Key Variables:
- **currentSectionID**: Stores the existing `SectionID` value from the `eventPayload`.
- **trimmedPath**: Contains the canonical path of the current page after removing the leading slash.
- **props**: An array of properties used to build the final `SectionID`.
- **mapReplace**: An object mapping characters or strings to be replaced in the final `SectionID` generation.

### Logic Flow:
1. **Trim Canonical Path**: The code first extracts and normalises the canonical path from the input payload, ensuring no trailing slashes are present.
  
2. **Determine Division**: If the canonical path starts with `/business`, it updates the `Division` property and trims the path accordingly.

3. **Initial SectionID Calculation**: 
   - If the trimmed path is empty or points to the homepage, it creates a default `SectionID` using known brand attributes.
   - If a specific page is accessed, it constructs the `SectionID` by concatenating various attributes (like Brand, Division, and Journey details).

4. **String Manipulation**: The constructed `SectionID` undergoes character replacements as defined in `mapReplace` to ensure the final format is consistent.

5. **Unique and Alarm Handling**: 
   - The code gathers additional properties to append to the `SectionID`, ensuring uniqueness with the help of a filtering function.
   - If the path indicates a login error, it appends an error code for tracking.

6. **Update Data Layer**: Finally, it checks if the generated `SectionID` has changed from the existing one; if so, it updates the data layer accordingly.

### Dependencies:
This code relies on the external `clova3` object and its method `datalayer` for managing data. The code checks properties from the `eventPayload`, making certain assumptions about their presence.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Conditions:
- When a user navigates to a product page, the `CanonicalPath` might be `/business/products/item123`. The extension would parse this to generate an appropriate `SectionID`, such as `brand:business:platform:journey_name:product_subgroup:item123`.

### Edge Conditions:
- If the user accesses the URL `/business/`, the code constructs a default `SectionID` like `brand:business:platform:home`.
- On a login error page (`login.jsp?messageKey=error123`), the resulting `SectionID` would include the error code, e.g., `brand:division:logon:error123`.

---

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas
- The extension does not account for malformed URLs and may fail to generate a `SectionID` if the `CanonicalPath` is not in the expected format.
- Heavy reliance on specific `eventPayload` properties means that any change in upstream data may cause issues.
- If integration with other extensions manipulates the same properties, unexpected behaviours may occur, particularly if they change the state of `b`.

---

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring
- **Defensive Checks**: Implement checks to ensure that all expected properties exist before accessing them, preventing runtime errors.
- **Modularisation**: Consider breaking down large logic blocks into smaller functions to improve readability and maintainability.
- **Consistent Formatting**: Standardise the naming conventions used throughout, especially in the `mapReplace` logic.
- **Documentation**: Add inline comments to clarify the purpose of key sections of code, enhancing long-term maintainability.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes
- **Ownership**: Assign a specific team or individual for ongoing maintenance of this extension.
- **Updating**: Regular audits should be conducted to check the extension's functionality, particularly after any updates to data structure or website changes.
- **Testing Guidelines**: Implement comprehensive unit tests that cover normal and edge cases, particularly focusing on validating `SectionID` generation under varied scenarios.
