# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: LivePerson Section ID

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name**: LivePerson Section ID  
- **ID**: 1320 (extension instance), 100040 (extension reference to Advanced Javascript Code)  
- **Type**: Advanced Javascript Code  
- **Scope**: Before Load Rules  
- **Execution Frequency**: Run Always

**Summary**:  
This extension determines and sets the value of a custom property called SectionID in the data layer. It starts by checking if an existing SectionID is different from the newly computed one, and if so, it updates the data layer accordingly. The code conditions the SectionID based on the URL path (using the CanonicalPath variable), brand-specific logic (e.g. handling when the path starts with “/business”), and other context values from the data layer. In addition, the section extends its logic to include other context properties for richer segmentation, which in some cases incorporates custom values (like CustomWebchatSection) and error codes from the login page.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables and Globals

- **Global Variables / Objects**:  
  - `eventType` (passed as parameter "a"): Although not directly used in the code.  
  - `eventPayload` (passed as parameter "b"): Contains properties such as SectionID, CanonicalPath, Brand, Division, Platform, and others.  
  - `clova3.datalayer`: An external data layer object used to retrieve (via .get()) and update (via .set()) values.
  - `window.location`: Used to check the current URL for login page scenarios.

- **Local Variables**:  
  - `currentSectionID`: Stores the current value of b.SectionID before processing.  
  - `trimmedPath`: Derived from b.CanonicalPath after stripping the first character ("/").  
  - `trimmedStepName`: Derived from trimmedPath and modified conditionally if the URL contains the string "cwa".  
  - `dl`: Holds the current data layer values from clova3.datalayer.get().  
  - `pageContext`: String created by concatenating values from a series of context properties obtained from eventPayload and the external data layer.  
  - `mapReplace`: An object mapping strings like "/", "-", ".asp", ".html", " " etc. to replacement strings for sanitisation.

- **Additional Variables**:  
  - `props`: An array of property names that are considered relevant for forming a list of sections for further concatenation.
  - `section`: An array derived from the values of the properties in props, converted to lowercase, and stripped of spaces and commas.
  - `unique`: A helper function that removes duplicate values from the section array.

### Logic Flow

1. **Initial Setup & CanonicalPath Processing**:  
   - The extension obtains the currentSectionID from eventPayload.
   - It creates a trimmedPath variable by removing the leading "/" in the CanonicalPath.
   - If the CanonicalPath begins with “/business”, it sets the Division property to “Business” and further adjusts trimmedPath.

2. **Handling Trailing Slash**:  
   - If the trimmedPath ends with a slash, it is trimmed from the end.

3. **SectionID Generation Logic**:  
   - **Homepage or Personal Page Condition**:  
     If the trimmedPath is empty or equals "personal.asp", the SectionID is generated by concatenating the Brand, Division, Platform and “home” values (after filtering non-string values), separated by colons and converted to lowercase.
   - **General Case (non-homepage)**:  
     - It retrieves additional data from the external data layer (dl).  
     - The code determines a trimmed step name by extracting the substring after the last “/”. If the URL contains "cwa", it uses the JourneyStepName from the data layer.
     - Constructs a pageContext string by joining a series of context properties (including Brand, Division, Platform/domain, JourneyName, JourneyProduct, and step name) with colons.
     - The pageContext string then goes through a series of replacements as defined in mapReplace, sanitising the string.
     - Lastly, if the resulting pageContext ends with an underscore, it is removed.  
     - The newly built pageContext string is then assigned as the new SectionID.

4. **Update of Data Layer if Changed**:  
   - If the computed SectionID is different from the currentSectionID in the data layer, the extension updates the SectionID using clova3.datalayer.set.

5. **Extended SectionID Construction** (Commented "NEW"):

   - **Property Array & Section Array Preparation**:  
     - A fixed array (`props`) is defined listing additional context properties relevant for further segmentation.
     - The code maps over this array to get corresponding values from eventPayload, filtering out any falsey or non-string values, and processes the strings (lowercase conversion, removal of spaces, commas).
   - **Inclusion of Custom Section Values**:  
     - If b.SectionID exists, it is pushed into the section array.
     - If a CustomWebchatSection property exists and is a string, it is also added.
   - **Login Page Special Handling**:  
     - The code checks if the current URL is a login page (login.jsp) and contains an error message parameter ("messageKey"). If so, it pushes an identifier in the format "Logon:ERRORCODE" into the section array.
   - **Final SectionID Assignment**:  
     - The helper function unique is used to remove duplicate values from the section array.
     - The unique values are then joined with commas and assigned as the new SectionID.

### Dependencies

- The extension relies on the existence of the global object `clova3.datalayer` with methods:
  - `.get()` to retrieve the data layer object.
  - `.set(property, value, persistFlag)` to update the data layer with the new SectionID.
- The extension makes use of standard browser globals like `window.location` to determine context for specific pages (e.g. login pages).
- The code assumes `eventType` and `eventPayload` are provided by Tealium iQ and adheres to ES5 standards.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Example 1: Homepage or Personal Page
- **Input Conditions**:
  - b.CanonicalPath is "/" or "personal.asp".
  - b.Brand = "brandname", b.Division (if available), b.Platform = "web".
- **Outcome**:
  - The SectionID is generated as "brandname:division:web:home".
  - The data layer is updated with the new SectionID if it differs from the previous value.

### Example 2: Business Section Page
- **Input Conditions**:
  - b.CanonicalPath starts with "/business" (e.g. "/business/somepage").
- **Outcome**:
  - b.Division is explicitly set to "Business".
  - The trimmedPath is adjusted accordingly (removing "/business" from the beginning).
  - The SectionID is computed based on sanitized values from Brand, Division, Platform, JourneyName, JourneyProduct, and a trimmed step name.

### Example 3: Generic Page with Custom Journey Information
- **Input Conditions**:
  - b.CanonicalPath is "/some/complex/path/".
  - The external data layer (dl) provides additional context such as JourneyStepName …
- **Outcome**:
  - The pageContext string is constructed by combining several properties and then sanitised (replacing forbidden characters as defined in mapReplace).
  - If a CustomWebchatSection is present, it is also included.
  - The final SectionID could look like:
    "brand:division:platform:journeyname:journeyproduct:stepspecificdetail"  
  - The computed SectionID is updated into the data layer if it is different from the original.

### Example 4: Login Page Error Handling
- **Input Conditions**:
  - The current URL contains "login.jsp" and a search string with "messageKey=ERRORCODE".
- **Outcome**:
  - In addition to the other context values, the string "Logon:ERRORCODE" is appended to the section array.
  - This helps in identifying error states on the login page.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Reliance on External Data**:  
  If the global object `clova3.datalayer` is not present or its methods are misbehaving, the extension will fail to retrieve or set the SectionID correctly.

- **URL Path Assumptions**:  
  The script assumes that the CanonicalPath always starts with a “/” and is well-formed. Edge cases where this is not followed could lead to an invalid SectionID.

- **Hard-coded String Replacements**:  
  The mapReplace object uses literal string keys for sanitisation. Unanticipated characters might be introduced if new URL structures or data fields include additional special characters.

- **Multiple Updates**:  
  The extension updates the data layer only if the computed SectionID differs from the current value. Any subtle differences (e.g. trailing underscores before removal) depend heavily on the sanitisation flow, which might lead to unintended updates.

- **Potential Conflicts with Other Extensions**:  
  Since the extension works in the "Before Load Rules" scope and could be altering shared properties (like Division or SectionID), there might be conflicts if other Tealium extensions attempt to update these properties.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Code and Logging**:  
  Even though eventType and eventPayload are guaranteed, consider adding logging (or error handling) in a production environment to capture unexpected property values on b (eventPayload).  
  - For example, logging when a expected property is missing could help debugging.
  
- **Improved Readability Through Modularisation**:  
  Break the code into smaller helper functions for:
  - URL path trimming and sanitisation.
  - Building the pageContext string.
  - Processing the props list and merging the final section array.
  
- **Centralise the Character Replacement Mapping**:  
  Consider abstracting the loop that applies replacements (using the mapReplace object) into a dedicated function, improving readability and maintainability.

- **Clarify Condition Handling for Special Cases**:  
  Comment and separate the login page handling code in its own block/function to improve maintainability.

- **Consistent String Manipulation**:  
  Ensure that string operations (e.g. trimming spaces or underscores) are consistent across all parts of the code. This might involve creating utility functions that standardise the sanitisation process.

*Note*: Maintain ES5 standards by continuing to use function expressions and avoiding ES6 features like arrow functions, let/const, or template literals.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance**:  
  - Keep the extension documentation updated as new rules or properties are added to the eventPayload or business logic changes.
  - Regularly test the extension against different types of URL paths and data conditions.
  
- **Ownership**:  
  - Assign a maintainer or team responsible for the Tealium iQ configuration so that changes in business logic or data requirements are promptly reflected in the extension.
  
- **Testing Guidelines**:  
  - Develop a suite of tests or manual test cases covering all the scenarios detailed in the Usage Examples section.
  - Monitor the data layer updates via browser console logs (or a dedicated logging solution) after deployment to ensure that the correct SectionID is recorded.
  - Ensure compatibility with other extensions running in the same lifecycle context and confirm that no unintended overwrites occur.

- **Code Reviews and Versioning**:  
  - Use version control and peer reviews to validate and document any changes to the extension code.
  - Maintain change logs to track alterations and rationale behind updates.
