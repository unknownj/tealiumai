# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation

## 1. Extension Overview
- **Name**: LBG : BLR : SET : CANONICALDOMAINPROD
- **ID**: 1322
- **Type**: Advanced Javascript Code
- **Scope**: Before Load Rules
- **Execution Frequency**: Run Always

### Summary
This extension is designed to determine and set the appropriate canonical domain for various brands under Lloyds Banking Group. It inspects the current domain or hostname, matching it against specific patterns to appropriately map it to a production domain. The primary output is stored in the data layer as `CanonicalDomainProd`, which can then be used by other extensions or tags within the Tealium environment.

## 2. Code Explanation
### Key Variables
- `datalayer`: Refers to the global Clova3 data layer from which existing values can be retrieved and updated.
- `CanonicalDomain`: Fetches the current canonical domain from the data layer or defaults to the hostname of the current window.

### Logic Flow
1. **Retrieve Canonical Domain**: The code first fetches the `CanonicalDomain` value from the Clova3 data layer or falls back to the current window's hostname.
2. **Determine Matching Group**: 
   - It checks if the domain contains `.intranet.test.group`. If true, it uses the `returnStringMatcherPublic` function; otherwise, it uses `returnStingMatcher`.
3. **Map to Production Domain**: Based on the extracted matching string, the code determines the corresponding production domain using the `returnProductionDomain` function.
4. **Set Data Layer Value**: Finally, it stores the resulting production domain in the data layer under the key `CanonicalDomainProd`.
5. **Error Handling**: If any error occurs during execution, it logs an error message to the console.

### Dependencies
- **Global Variables**: The extension relies on the global object `clova3.datalayer` for its operations. This is essential for both retrieving and setting values.
- **Regular Expressions**: Utilizes regex patterns to match the domain against specific cases.

## 3. Usage Examples
### Normal Scenario
1. **Input**: The user is on `www.lloydsbank.co.uk`.
2. **Behavior**: The extension matches 'wwwlloydsbankcom' and sets `CanonicalDomainProd` to `www.lloydsbank.com`.

### Edge Conditions
1. **Input**: The user is on an internal test domain, e.g. `www-bankofscotland-co-uk.intranet.test.group`.
2. **Behavior**: The regex match will trigger `returnStringMatcherPublic`, providing a valid production domain of `www.bankofscotland.co.uk`.

3. **Input**: An unrecognised string like `unknown-domain.com`.
4. **Behavior**: This will fall back to the existing `CanonicalDomain` without any change or error.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas
- **Non-Matching Domains**: If the domain does not match any of the specified patterns in the `returnProductionDomain` function, the output will default to the original `CanonicalDomain`, which may not be desirable.
- **Conflicts with Other Extensions**: Other extensions that manipulate the `CanonicalDomain` value in the data layer might override the results of this extension if they execute later in the processing flow.
- **Global Dependencies**: The reliance on `clova3.datalayer` makes the extension susceptible to changes in the data layer structure or availability.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring
- **Code Structure**: Consider modularising the regex matching functions to improve readability and future maintainability. This would separate concerns, making the core logic easier to follow.
- **Documentation**: Add inline comments to clarify complex sections, particularly around the regex patterns and their significance, to aid future developers in understanding the mappings more easily.
- **Performance Optimization**: Evaluate the performance impacts of frequent regex evaluations, especially for high-traffic scenarios. Pre-compiling regex patterns could save processing time in a runtime context.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes
- **Ownership**: Assign a specific developer or team to oversee the extension, ensuring they are familiar with the existing logic and its implications across the Tealium ecosystem.
- **Testing Guidelines**: Establish a testing regimen that includes unit tests for the regex patterns and edge cases, alongside integration tests to validate interaction with the data layer.
- **Change Management**: Document any changes made to the extension methodically, including rationale and outcomes, to facilitate easier updates in the future. 

This documentation is designed to provide clear guidelines for understanding and maintaining the `CanonicalDomainProd` extension in Tealium iQ, ensuring it meets ongoing business requirements efficiently.
