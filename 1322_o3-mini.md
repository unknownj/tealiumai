# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** LBG : BLR : SET : CANONICALDOMAINPROD  
- **ID:** 1322  
- **Extension Type:** Advanced Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** Before Load Rules  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Always  

**Summary:**  
This extension is designed to determine and set a production canonical domain value based on the existing canonical domain value from the data layer. It performs pattern matching on the canonical domain using regular expressions, extracts pertinent sub-string components, and then maps these to a corresponding production domain. The result is stored in the data layer as a new variable – "CanonicalDomainProd" – which is later used by other tags or extensions to ensure consistency across domains.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables and Functions

- **datalayer:**  
  - The extension relies on a globally available object (in this example referenced as `clova3.datalayer`) which provides getter and setter methods.
  - The value for `"CanonicalDomain"` is retrieved from the data layer. If undefined, it defaults to using `window.location.hostname`.

- **CanonicalDomain:**  
  - The original domain value (or the host name) against which matching is performed.

- **arrayToString(array):**  
  - A helper function which converts an array of matching groups into a single string.
  - If the array is undefined or null, it returns `undefined`.  
  - The first element of the array is removed (using `shift()`) as it represents the whole match, and then the remaining parts are concatenated together.

- **returnStingMatcher(actualCanonicalDomain):**  
  - Uses a regular expression tailored for domains that are not public.
  - The regex `/.*[dm]([lhbm])([bp])-(secure|apio|apis|apply|online).*\.digital\.lloydsbank\.co\.uk/g` is used to extract parts of the domain.
  - Calls `arrayToString` to convert the matching groups to a string.

- **returnStringMatcherPublic(actualCanonicalDomain):**  
  - Uses a different regular expression for public domains.
  - The regex `/.*(wwwlloydsbankcom|wwwbankofscotlandcouk|wwwhalifaxcouk).*.intranet.test.group/g` is applied.
  - Similarly, the matching groups are passed to `arrayToString`.

- **returnProductionDomain(matchedString, defaultValue):**  
  - A switch-case structure maps the concatenated string (from either matching function) to a fully qualified production domain.
  - It covers multiple scenarios covering Lloyds, Halifax, BOS, MBNA, AMS and a sandbox environment.
  - If none of the cases match, the function returns the original canonical domain provided as `defaultValue`.

### Logic Flow

1. **Retrieve the Canonical Domain:**  
   - The code retrieves the `"CanonicalDomain"` variable from the data layer.  
   - If `CanonicalDomain` is not defined, `window.location.hostname` is used.

2. **Matching Process:**  
   - The code then decides which regular expression to use based on whether the canonical domain contains `'.intranet.test.group'`.
     - If it does, `returnStringMatcherPublic` is used.
     - Otherwise, `returnStingMatcher` is applied.
   - The result is a concatenated string which represents a combination of subdomains or identifiers.

3. **Mapping to Production Domain:**  
   - The `returnProductionDomain` function accepts the matched string and maps it to a production domain using a series of explicit cases.
   - If no match is found, the default (original) canonical domain is retained.

4. **Setting the Production Domain:**  
   - Finally, the computed production domain value is assigned back into the data layer under the variable `"CanonicalDomainProd"`.

5. **Error Handling:**  
   - Any errors encountered during the execution of the code are caught and logged to the console.

### Dependencies

- The code assumes the existence of the global object `clova3.datalayer` which exposes the `get` and `set` methods to work with the data layer.
- It relies on basic browser globals such as `window.location.hostname`.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Standard Domain Matching

- **Input:**  
  - Assume the data layer has `"CanonicalDomain": "https://mponline.digital.lloydsbank.co.uk"`.
  - The regex in `returnStingMatcher` would match the respective groups from the domain.
- **Behaviour:**  
  - The helper function concatenates the captured groups (after removing the full match element).
  - The switch-case in `returnProductionDomain` maps the string (e.g. `'mponline'`) to a production domain such as `"online.mbna.co.uk"`.
  - The data layer is then updated with `"CanonicalDomainProd": "online.mbna.co.uk"`.

### Scenario 2: Public Domain Conversion

- **Input:**  
  - A canonical domain value from a public domain, e.g. `"https://wwwhalifaxcouk.intranet.test.group"`.
- **Behaviour:**  
  - The extension checks for `'.intranet.test.group'` and uses `returnStringMatcherPublic` to match the public domain identifier.
  - After processing, it maps (using switch-case) the concatenated result (e.g. `'wwwhalifaxcouk'`) to its corresponding production domain, such as `"www.halifax.co.uk"`.
  - The resulting production canonical domain is then set in the data layer.

### Scenario 3: Edge Condition with Non-matching Domain

- **Input:**  
  - If the canonical domain does not match any of the regular expressions or cases; for instance, a misconfigured or unexpected domain structure.
- **Behaviour:**  
  - The helper functions return `undefined` or a non-definitive match.
  - The `returnProductionDomain` function then falls back to its default clause and returns the original `"CanonicalDomain"`.
  - The data layer variable `"CanonicalDomainProd"` is set to the unmodified original value.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Regular Expression Fragility:**  
  - The regular expressions are hard-coded. Any change in domain naming conventions or additional domain patterns may require corresponding updates to these regex patterns.

- **Hard-Coded Mapping:**  
  - The switch-case in `returnProductionDomain` explicitly maps known strings to production domains. New domains or changes in brand conventions will necessitate updates to this function.

- **Global Object Dependency:**  
  - The usage of `clova3.datalayer` assumes that this global object is always available. If this object is not initialised or available, the extension might throw errors or fail silently (after logging the error to the console).

- **Execution Context:**  
  - Being a “Before Load Rules” extension that runs always, any error in this code might affect subsequent load rules if not handled properly.
  
- **Domain Name Edge Cases:**  
  - Domains with unexpected structures may not match either of the regex expressions; hence the default value is used, which might not be ideal in all cases.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Modularise the Code:**  
  - Consider separating helper functions (e.g. `arrayToString`, `returnStingMatcher`, `returnStringMatcherPublic`, `returnProductionDomain`) into a modular structure (as much as possible within the ES5 constraints). This will simplify testing and further maintenance.

- **Improve Readability:**  
  - Add more inline comments explaining the purpose of critical code sections; this could aid future developers with understanding the logic quickly.
  
- **Error Handling Enhancements:**  
  - Whilst the current try-catch block logs to the console, consider logging critical errors to an external logging service if supported by your project.
  
- **Testing Expandability:**  
  - Write unit tests for the helper functions so that updates in regular expressions or domain mappings can be verified in isolation.
  
- **Consistent Naming Conventions:**  
  - Some function names (e.g. `returnStingMatcher`) appear to have typographical errors. A consistent naming convention can reduce confusion.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  - Designate an owner or a team to update the regular expressions and switch-case mappings as domain naming conventions evolve.
  - Establish guidelines for updating the extension whenever new brands or domains are introduced.

- **Version Control and Documentation:**  
  - Keep track of changes in a version control system, and update this documentation accordingly when changes are made.
  - Ensure that any modifications are fully tested within a staging or sandbox environment before being released to production.

- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Consider automated testing with both unit tests (for individual functions) and integration tests (ensuring the value is correctly set in the data layer).
  - Regularly conduct peer reviews of changes to ensure consistency and to catch any potential issues early.

- **Interference With Other Scripts:**  
  - Verify that this extension does not conflict with any other Tealium iQ extensions or external scripts. Perform regression testing especially after updates to any interconnected code modules.

This documentation should serve as a comprehensive guide for developers and stakeholders, ensuring the expected functionality of the extension is well understood, maintained, and extended where necessary.
