# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: AppNexus Universal ID Lookup

## 1. Extension Overview
- **Name**: AppNexus Universal ID Lookup
- **ID**: 1448
- **Type**: Lookup Table
- **Scope**: Before Load Rules
- **Execution Frequency**: Run Always

### Summary
The "AppNexus Universal ID Lookup" extension is designed to enhance the user interaction tracking by integrating with the LBGAnalytics library. It captures click events on tooltips and sends relevant data as events to the LBGAnalytics system. This functionality is crucial for understanding user engagement with tooltips, which can provide insights into content effectiveness and user interest.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- **window.LBGAnalytics**: A global object representing the LBG Analytics library, used for tracking events.
- **ttid**: The ID of the tooltip being interacted with, extracted from the HTML element.
- **tttext**: The text content of the tooltip, also extracted from the HTML element.

### Logic Flow
1. The code checks if the `LBGAnalytics` library is available and if it contains an `events` object with a `tooltip` property.
2. If the conditions are met, an event listener is set up on the document to listen for click events on elements with the role of `tooltip`.
3. When a tooltip is clicked, the ID and text of the tooltip are collected.
4. An event is then sent to the LBGAnalytics system, passing the collected data as parameters.

### Dependencies
- The extension relies on the LBGAnalytics library being loaded and available in the global scope.
- It expects the tooltips to follow a specific structure in the HTML, with a `.tooltip-container` to contain the ID and text.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Condition
When a user clicks on a tooltip with the ID `tooltip-123` and the text `Information about feature X`, the extension captures these details and fires an event to the analytics platform as follows:
- Event Type: `tooltip`
- Tooltip ID: `tooltip-123`
- Tooltip Text: `Information about feature X`

### Edge Condition
If a tooltip is clicked but does not contain any `.tooltip-container`, the data captured may be incomplete:
- Tooltip ID: `undefined`
- Tooltip Text: `undefined`
In this case, the event would still be sent to LBGAnalytics, but it may not carry meaningful information, which can hinder the analysis.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas
- The extension is dependent on the structure of the tooltipâ€™s DOM. If the `.tooltip-container` class is missing or altered, the event data may be incomplete.
- There is potential for event conflicts if multiple tooltips are clicked in quick succession, which may lead to race conditions in the analytics tracking.
- Ensure that the LBGAnalytics script is loaded before the extension runs to avoid any null reference errors.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring
- Consider encapsulating the tooltip click event logic within a function to improve readability and maintainability. For example:
  ```javascript
  function handleTooltipClick(event) {
      var ttid = event.target.querySelector(".tooltip-container").id;
      var tttext = event.target.querySelector(".tooltip-container").textContent;
      L.events.tooltip(undefined, ttid, tttext).send();
  }
  ```
- This will allow easier testing and reusability of the click handler.
- Implement logging for debugging purposes to catch scenarios when the `tooltip-container` is missing or if an unexpected error occurs during execution.
- Regularly update documentation as the HTML structure or LBGAnalytics library evolves.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes
- Regularly check for updates to the LBGAnalytics library and assess its compatibility with this extension.
- Ensure continuous testing across different browsers and interaction scenarios to mitigate the risk of issues arising from DOM changes.
- Assign a dedicated owner for this extension, responsible for monitoring its performance and functionality in production.
- Schedule routine reviews of the extension to identify any areas for improvement or to implement additional features based on analytics insights.
