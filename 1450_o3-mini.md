# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** OVA : TAG : Set : Halifax : Event Listeners : Mortgage  
- **ID:** 1450  
- **Extension Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** 1214  
- **Execution Frequency:**  
  - The extension code is loaded on page load (with a 3-second delay) if the user agent is not Internet Explorer. It then sets up event listeners and a virtual assistant interface.

**Summary:**  
This extension creates and manages a virtual assistant (VA) on the webpage. Its primary role is to handle user interactions by:
- Creating a container DIV for the VA interface.
- Setting up click event listeners on trigger elements (e.g. the VA toggle, submit button, and FAQ links) to capture user engagement.
- Tracking specific journey events using the Tealium utag.link mechanism.
- Loading additional VA functionality (scripts, CSS, and additional event handling code) after a slight delay to improve page load and performance.
  
The extension is used to enhance the customer experience by guiding users via an interactive virtual assistant tailored for mortgage-related queries, particularly for Halifax customers.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables & Objects
- **c$**  
  - Reference to a jQuery-like object (assumed to be provided by `window.clova2.$`).
- **window.clova3.log**  
  - Custom logging function used for debugging throughout the code.
- **window.utag.link**  
  - Tealium’s tracking mechanism used to fire link tracking calls with specified event data.
- **eventType, eventPayload, tagObject**  
  - Variables passed to the closure as parameters. They hold global data available to the extension.
  
### High-Level Logic Flow
1. **Initial Setup**  
   - The main function is executed immediately on load (if the browser is not MSIE) with a 3-second delay.
   - Three core functions are called:
     - `createCVEventHandlers()`: Defines event listeners for VA triggers and interactions.
     - `createCVContainer()`: Creates the main container `<div>` with the id "virtual-assistant" and appends it to the DOM body.
     - `loadCV()`: Loads the Virtual Assistant (VA) logic including script resources, event handling, and VA interface initialisation.
     
2. **Event Handlers**  
   - **VA Trigger Click:**  
     - Listens for clicks on elements with the class `va-trigger`. When clicked, it fires a Tealium link event indicating the VA overlay is being shown.
   - **VA Submit Click:**  
     - Monitors clicks on an input button with class `va-inp-btn` that has a value of "Submit". Upon click, it captures the text input from a field with the class `va-inp-txt` and sends it as part of a tracking call.
   - **FAQ Link Clicks:**  
     - Fires events when FAQ items (found in list items within `.va-faq-ul` or `.va-faqs`) are clicked. It captures the link text, indicating the user’s interest in additional information.
     
3. **Virtual Assistant (VA) Loading and Initialisation**
   - **loadCV Function:**  
     - Defines helper functions (e.g. `ask_question`, `bot_nav`) and attaches these as global functions.
     - Initialises the VA module (`VAMD`) which handles:
       - Loading required JavaScript and CSS resources.
       - Dynamically inserting the VA HTML template into the container.
       - Configuring various options for the VA such as business context, autocomplete settings, mobile channel options, templates, etc.
   - **Dependency on External Resources:**  
     - The VA module requires additional resources (e.g. `jquery.min.js`, `main.min.js`, `main.min.css`) loaded from a remote resource URI.
     - Interacts with global objects like `va` for engine initialisation, and uses jQuery (or a similar API via `c$`) to manage DOM events and AJAX calls.
     
4. **Advanced Functionality**
   - **Autocomplete Feature:**  
     - Listens to keyup and keydown events in the input field to trigger an AJAX call for autocomplete suggestions.
   - **Modal & Survey Management:**  
     - Contains helper functions within `VAMD.helper` to create and remove modals, including surveys for feedback after using the Virtual Assistant.
   - **ICS (Interactive Call Scoring) Module:**  
     - Provides event handlers for survey submission and vote collection. Sends data via AJAX to a remote endpoint.
     
### Dependencies on Global Objects/Libraries
- **jQuery (or a similar API through c$):**  
  - Utilised for DOM manipulation, event handling, and AJAX calls.
- **window.clova2.$ / window.clova3:**  
  - Used to access the jQuery instance and custom logging functions.
- **Tealium utag.link:**  
  - Used to track various user interactions and journey events.
- **Global Variables:**  
  - The code creates global functions (e.g., `ask_question`, `bot_nav`) and attaches the `VAMD` module to both `window` and as a return value.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Flow
- **User Opens Virtual Assistant:**  
  - After a 3-second delay on page load, the container for the Virtual Assistant is created and event handlers are bound.
  - When the user clicks on any element with the class `va-trigger`, a Tealium tracking call is fired (indicating the start of a VA journey), and the VA interface is made visible.
  
- **User Submits a Question:**  
  - The user inputs a question in the text field and clicks the "Submit" button.
  - The value from the text field is captured and a tracking call is sent with the event details (JourneyStep 2: Field Update, EventAction "Filter", EventValue corresponding to the question).

- **User Clicks an FAQ Link:**  
  - If the user clicks on any FAQ link, the text of the clicked element is extracted and a tracking call (JourneyStep 3: Internal Link) is sent to record user interest.

### Edge or Unusual Conditions
- **Empty Input on Submit:**  
  - If a user clicks the submit button without entering any text, the code still triggers a tracking call with (potentially empty) text. No additional validation is performed within the extension itself.
  
- **Autocomplete Usage:**  
  - When typing in the input field, if the input length is less than or equal to 1, the autocomplete dropdown is removed. If a network issue occurs during the AJAX call for autocomplete suggestions, the error callback logs the error in the console.
  
- **Survey Cancellation or Failure:**  
  - If a survey modal is opened and the user cancels or closing it triggers a "cancelled" event, the VA engine is notified with a special entry value (`_ics_user_cancelled_`).

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Dependency on External Libraries and Global Objects:**  
  - The extension heavily relies on the presence of a jQuery-like object via `window.clova2.$` and the logging functionality from `window.clova3.log`. If these are not present or are overridden by other scripts, errors may occur.
  
- **External Resource Failures:**  
  - The Virtual Assistant module loads additional resources from remote URIs. Network latency or failures might delay or prevent the full functionality of the VA interface.
  
- **Browser Compatibility Notice:**  
  - The code explicitly checks that the browser user agent is not Internet Explorer (MSIE) before executing the delayed functions. IE users will not see the Virtual Assistant loaded.
  
- **Event Handling Conflicts:**  
  - If other Tealium extensions or external scripts are also attaching event listeners to the same DOM elements (e.g. `.va-trigger`), conflicts or unexpected behaviours might occur.
  
- **Global Namespace Pollution:**  
  - Several global functions (e.g. `ask_question`, `bot_nav`, and the `VAMD` object) are exposed, which could lead to naming collisions if other scripts define the same names.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

### Code Organisation & Modularisation
- Consider refactoring the code into smaller, self-contained modules to improve readability and maintainability.
- Encapsulate related functionalities (event handling, resource loading, autocomplete, survey management) into separate files or functions.

### Defensive Coding Enhancements
- Although defensive coding for the guarantee of `eventType` and `eventPayload` is not required, additional null/undefined checks could be added for other global objects (e.g. verifying the existence of `window.clova2.$` or `window.clova3.log`) to reduce runtime errors.
- Validate external resource loading (e.g. script and stylesheet loads) and provide fallback logic or error reporting if resources fail to load.

### Code Style & Consistency (ES5)
- Ensure that all loops and conditionals use clear ES5 syntax. For example, use traditional function declarations and avoid newer ES6+ features.
- Replace inline anonymous functions with named functions where possible for improved stack trace readability.
- Maintain consistent indentation and code comments throughout the file for clarity.

### Potential Refactoring Areas
- **Resource Loader:**  
  - The script loader function could be abstracted into a generic utility for all asynchronous resource loads.
- **UI Initialisation:**  
  - The virtual assistant interface HTML template generation could be separated into a static HTML file (or a templating mechanism) to decouple logic from content.
- **Event Binding:**  
  - Consolidate similar event bindings and potentially use delegation more exclusively to optimise performance.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

### Ongoing Maintenance
- **Ownership:**  
  - Assign a specific developer or team to maintain the Virtual Assistant functionality and the associated tracking code.
- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Create unit tests for core functions (e.g. resource loading, event firing, and DOM manipulations) using your existing ES5-compatible testing framework.
  - Regenerate user journey maps to ensure that utag.link calls fire correctly and that data tracking remains accurate after any modifications.
- **Documentation Updates:**  
  - Keep this documentation up-to-date as new features or refactoring changes are introduced.
- **Monitoring Dependencies:**  
  - Regularly verify that external resource URIs remain valid and that any third-party libraries being used (e.g. jQuery) remain compatible with the extension.
- **Performance Reviews:**  
  - Analyse the impact of delayed loading and event binding on overall page performance; consider adjustments if the virtual assistant significantly affects page responsiveness.
- **Cross-Browser Testing:**  
  - Although IE is excluded, monitor the extension’s performance on all supported browsers to ensure compatibility with various user environments.
