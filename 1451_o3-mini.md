# LivePerson Site ID Tealium Extension Documentation

This document provides an in-depth guide on the LivePerson Site ID extension. It covers an overview of the extension, its code logic, usage examples, limitations, refactoring suggestions, and maintenance notes. This documentation is intended for developers and stakeholders who need to understand, maintain, or extend this functionality.

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** LivePerson Site ID
- **Extension ID:** 1451 (Tealium iQ Extension ID: 100040)
- **Type:** Advanced Javascript Code
- **Scope:** Before Load Rules
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Always

**Summary:**  
This extension is responsible for determining the appropriate LivePerson configuration for the current page context. It does so by iterating through an ordered array of configuration objects, each defined with its own criteria function. The first configuration that meets its criteria will be selected. Upon selection, the extension sets the corresponding LivePerson Site ID and Site Name into the data layer. This ensures that subsequent analytics or web chat scripts reference the correct configuration. The main goal is to automate the selection of LivePerson accounts based on the environment (e.g. dev, qa, production) and page-specific conditions, ensuring consistency and reducing manual errors in setting the LivePerson configuration.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables and Structures

- **livePersonAccountConfigs:**  
  An array containing configuration objects for different environments and page types. Each object has:
  - A `name` property for identification.
  - A `criteria` property which is a function that specifies conditions under which that configuration should be selected. The criteria can use the `window.location` properties and optionally a provided data layer object (`dl`).
  - An `id` property representing the LivePerson Site ID to be applied.

- **getLivePersonConfig(dl):**  
  A helper function that loops through the `livePersonAccountConfigs` array and returns the first configuration object whose `criteria` function returns true.

- **Data Layer Objects:**  
  The code makes use of an injected data layer (provided as parameter `b` and referenced in several functions as `dl`). It also sets values into a secondary analytics-dedicated data layer via `LBGAnalytics.datalayer.set`.

### Logic Flow

1. **Initial Check:**  
   - The code first checks whether `b.LP_SiteID` is already defined. If found, it returns early to avoid redundant processing.

2. **Configuration Selection:**  
   - Using `getLivePersonConfig` with the current data layer (`b`), it iterates through the list of configurations. Each configuration’s `criteria` function is executed.
   - As soon as a configuration object returns true, it is selected for use.

3. **Assigning LivePerson Config:**  
   - The selected configuration’s `id` and `name` are then assigned to the data layer properties: `LP_SiteID` and `LP_SiteName`.
   - These values are also set into `LBGAnalytics.datalayer` (with parameters to allow persistence for subsequent events).

4. **Error Handling:**  
   - The bulk of the code execution is wrapped in a try/catch block. This ensures that, if any error occurs (for example, due to an unexpected state in the data layer or window object properties), the error is silently handled without breaking subsequent scripts.

### Dependencies

- **Global Objects:**  
  - `window.location` is used extensively to determine the current hostname and path.
  - `sessionStorage` is utilised in some configurations (specifically for CBO environments) to persist state across page loads.
  - `document.createElement` and DOM manipulation methods are used for dynamically inserting and removing style elements.

- **External Libraries:**  
  - `LBGAnalytics.datalayer` is assumed to be a globally available object used for setting data layer variables.
  - The code assumes the presence of the event parameters `eventType` and `eventPayload` (passed in as `a` and `b` respectively) which are guaranteed by the Tealium environment.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Example 1: Embark Test Domains

- **Scenario:**  
  A user is visiting a test environment domain containing "-secure.digital.wealth.lloydsbank.co.uk".  
- **Criteria Logic:**  
  The `criteria` function for "Embark Test" checks if the `window.location.hostname` contains the specified substring.
- **Outcome:**  
  If true, the extension sets `b.LP_SiteID` to "89460435" and `b.LP_SiteName` to "Embark Test".

### Example 2: CBO Production Environment

- **Scenario:**  
  A user is on a CBO production domain (verified by hostname starting with "cbsecure").  
- **Criteria Logic:**  
  The criteria function for the "CBO" configuration:
  - Checks if the hostname starts with "cbsecure".
  - Checks if the customer has a CBO context (using the `dl.CustomerSegment` or previously stored session value).
  - Temporarily hides the webchat button if context is not found, then polls for a change.
- **Outcome:**  
  Once the customer is validated as being in a CBO context, the session storage is updated, and the style element hiding the button is removed.

### Example 3: Dev Environment

- **Scenario:**  
  The Tealium data layer property `ut.env` is set to "dev".  
- **Criteria Logic:**  
  The "Dev environment" configuration directly checks the data layer for `dl["ut.env"] === "dev"`.
- **Outcome:**  
  The extension sets the `LP_SiteID` and `LP_SiteName` for the dev instance (with an ID of "21463023").

### Example 4: Default Behavior (Edge Case)

- **Scenario:**  
  None of the specific conditions apply.  
- **Criteria Logic:**  
  The “Default” configuration’s criteria always returns true.
- **Outcome:**  
  The extension falls back to setting a default LivePerson configuration with the ID "49955747".

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Global Object Assumptions:**  
  The code relies on global objects such as `window.location` and `document`. If these are manipulated by other scripts or are not available (e.g. in non-browser environments), the extension may fail.

- **Repeated or Duplicate Conditions:**  
  Some hostnames and conditions appear more than once within different configuration objects. This may lead to confusion and maintenance challenges. For example, similar hostname checks for various environments (O4B, CBO, etc.) exist in multiple places.

- **Timing and Asynchronous Behaviour:**  
  The polling mechanism used in the CBO configurations (setting timeouts and checking for customer context) may lead to temporary UI artefacts (button hiding) if the customer context is not updated promptly.

- **Data Layer Dependency:**  
  The extension assumes that data layer keys such as `ut.env` and `CustomerSegment` exist. If these keys are missing or misconfigured, the criteria may fail silently.

- **Potential Conflicts:**  
  If another Tealium extension or script modifies `b.LP_SiteID` or `LBGAnalytics.datalayer` concurrently, there might be race conditions or conflicting configurations.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Modularise the Criteria Functions:**  
  Consider extracting repeated or similar hostname checks into helper functions. This could reduce duplication and make the criteria functions easier to maintain.

- **Improve Logging and Error Handling:**  
  Although error handling is implemented via try/catch blocks, adding more descriptive logging (perhaps conditionally enabled) might help in diagnosing issues in production.

- **Code Comments and Documentation:**  
  Expand inline comments for complex sections (especially the CBO configurations) to ensure that developers understand the purpose of each block.

- **Encapsulate DOM Manipulation:**  
  The creation and removal of style elements for temporarily hiding the webchat button could be refactored into a dedicated utility function.

- **Consistency in Criteria Syntax:**  
  Ensure that similar conditions (e.g. hostname checks for both dev and production) follow a consistent pattern to improve readability and maintainability.

- **ES5 Compliance Considerations:**  
  While adhering to ES5, ensure that legacy syntax is consistently applied. Do not migrate to ES6 features such as arrow functions or template literals, as required for compatibility.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Testing:**  
  Develop a test plan that includes unit tests for the criteria functions (where possible) and integration tests ensuring that `LP_SiteID` and `LP_SiteName` are set correctly given various simulated environments.

- **Ownership and Versioning:**  
  Clearly document which team or developer owns this extension. Maintain version control via GitHub with proper commit messages to track changes over time.

- **Configuration Updates:**  
  As new environments or pages are added, update the `livePersonAccountConfigs` array accordingly. Review the order of configurations to ensure that more specific rules are evaluated before generic ones (such as the default).

- **Documentation Updates:**  
  Update this documentation whenever significant changes are made to the extension logic. Consider linking this documentation to the related project’s repository and changelog.

- **Monitoring:**  
  Implement additional logging (if feasible) to capture when a configuration is selected. This can help in future debugging and in assessing the usage patterns of the extension.

- **Future Reviews:**  
  Schedule periodic reviews of the code to remove deprecated configurations, handle browser updates, and check for any interactions with new Tealium or analytics features.
