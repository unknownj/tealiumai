# CommCode Fix Extension Documentation

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** CommCode Fix  
- **Extension ID:** 1461  
- **Tealium Extension ID:** 100040  
- **Type:** Advanced Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** DOM Ready  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Once

**Summary:**  
This extension processes and handles the "CommCode" parameter found in the URL for specific domains (Lloyds Bank and Halifax). It extracts the CommCode value (if present), sets a cookie with this value, and then updates specific link elements on the page so that the CommCode is appended to their target URLs. This ensures that communications codes are consistently passed through to subsequent pages, supporting accurate tracking and specialised routing for marketing or user journeys.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables & Functions

- **Global Objects:**  
  - `window.location`, `document.cookie`, and `document.querySelectorAll` are used extensively.
  - No external libraries are used; only standard browser globals and ES5 features.

- **Functions:**

  - **getParameterByName(name, url):**  
    Retrieves the value of a URL parameter (in this case, "CommCode") regardless of case.  
    - Splits the URL at the question mark to isolate query parameters.
    - Uses a regular expression to search for the parameter name and returns its value or `null` if missing.
    - A secondary check (lowercase conversion) ensures case insensitivity.

  - **setCookie(cname, cvalue, exdays):**  
    Sets a cookie with the given name and value that expires after the specified number of days.
    - Constructs the expiry date and writes the cookie to `document.cookie`.

  - **getCookie(cname):**  
    Retrieves the value of a cookie by name by parsing `document.cookie`.
    - Iterates over each cookie and returns the matching value if found.

  - **replaceLink(link):**  
    Processes an anchor (`<a>`) element’s `href` attribute.
    - Extracts the base URL value after an equal sign (`=`) and decodes any encoded colons.
    - Appends the CommCode from the cookie as a query parameter to the link if the cookie exists.

  - **replaceInLink(link, url, defaultval):**  
    Substitutes a placeholder (`%1`) in a URL with the CommCode (or a default value if the CommCode is absent).
    - Sets the processed URL to the link’s `href`.

### Logical Flow

1. **Domain-Specific Execution:**  
   The script first checks the window’s hostname:
   - For Lloyds Bank (including staging and preview URLs).
   - For Halifax (including staging and preview URLs).
   Only when the current hostname matches the conditions does the corresponding block execute.

2. **CommCode Extraction & Cookie Handling:**  
   - The CommCode value is extracted from the URL using `getParameterByName("CommCode")`.
   - If present, `setCookie` is called to store the CommCode with a one-day expiry.

3. **Link Processing:**  
   - The script finds specific link elements using `document.querySelectorAll` for different URL patterns:
     - Links containing `/tools/apply_now_commcode.asp?url=`
     - For Lloyds, additional checks are done for links that redirect for car and van insurance.
   - For each found element, either `replaceLink` or `replaceInLink` is executed:
     - `replaceLink` is used to simply append the CommCode.
     - `replaceInLink` is used when the CommCode must replace a placeholder (`%1`) in a specific insurance URL with a fallback default value if the CommCode is empty.

4. **Error Handling:**  
   - Try/catch is used when processing the URL in `getParameterByName` to ensure that any manipulation errors do not halt execution.

### Dependencies

- The extension relies on global browser objects (e.g. `window`, `document`).
- It uses standard ES5 features (functions, string manipulation, and arrays) with no dependencies on external libraries.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Operation

- **Scenario:** A user visits `https://www.lloydsbank.com` with the URL parameter `?CommCode=ABC123`.
  - The script finds the "CommCode" value (`ABC123`).
  - Sets a cookie named "CommCode" with value `ABC123`.
  - Finds any matching anchor tags and updates their `href` attribute so that the CommCode is appended to the target URL.
  - For insurance URLs (e.g. `https://lloydsbankcarinsurance.insure-systems.co.uk/Car/%1/NLE`), `%1` is replaced with `ABC123`.

### Edge Conditions

- **Missing CommCode Parameter:**  
  If the URL does not contain a CommCode parameter:
  - No CommCode cookie is set.
  - The replacement functions still update links to remove or ignore the placeholder, using the default value where applicable (e.g. `"LY01"` for car insurance if the cookie is empty).

- **URL with Multiple Question Marks or Ampersands:**  
  The script makes a best effort to correctly join query string fragments. This prevents errors when encountering URLs with multiple `?` or unusual parameter formats.

- **Invalid or Malformed URL:**  
  The try/catch block in `getParameterByName` ensures that if URL parsing fails, the script will simply ignore the error, leaving URLs unmodified rather than breaking execution.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Repetitive Code Blocks:**  
  There are two nearly identical blocks for handling Lloyds Bank and Halifax domains. This duplication increases maintenance effort if changes are required.

- **Query String Manipulation:**  
  The method used to reassemble the URL query string is somewhat error-prone in very complex URLs (e.g. multiple `?` symbols or unexpected parameter formats).

- **Selector Robustness:**  
  Some selectors are commented out (e.g. the one for `asp_includes/appendURL.asp?linkID=`). Should these be needed, they must be thoroughly tested.

- **Cookie Dependency:**  
  The extension heavily relies on the existence of proper cookies. Any issues with cookie writing or reading could result in broken link redirections.

- **Potential Conflicts:**  
  Since the extension runs on DOM Ready and modifies URLs directly, there is a possibility of conflicts with other Tealium extensions or external scripts that also manipulate links or cookies on the same page.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Modularisation:**  
  Consider creating a single shared utility module for common functions (such as `getParameterByName`, `setCookie`, and `getCookie`) to eliminate code duplication between the Lloyds and Halifax blocks.

- **Code Style & Organisation:**  
  - Consolidate repetitive code segments into separate functions that accept domain-specific parameters (e.g. default insurance codes).
  - Use clear comments above each function to delineate responsibilities and expected input/outputs.

- **Robust URL Handling:**  
  - Review and refactor the URL manipulation logic to handle edge cases more gracefully.
  - Validate that the URL splitting and joining logic works as intended for a variety of URL formats.

- **Commenting & Documentation:**  
  Ensure that each function includes inline comments explaining its purpose, arguments, return values, and any potential pitfalls.

- **Testing:**  
  - Write unit tests for individual utility functions.
  - Perform testing on multiple domains and URL scenarios to ensure that cookie setting and URL replacements are reliable.
  
> Note: Remember that ES5 support is a requirement. Avoid using ES2015+ features such as arrow functions, template literals, or let/const. All refactoring suggestions should maintain compatibility with ES5 standards.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ownership:**  
  Clearly assign a maintainer or team responsible for the extension. Document the owner’s contact details for any future issues or queries.

- **Version Control:**  
  Track changes in a version control system (e.g. Git) and maintain clear change logs. This helps in tracing modifications and understanding the evolution of the codebase.

- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Integrate regular testing on new deployments, particularly after changes affecting cookie handling or URL manipulation.
  - Ensure comprehensive testing across all supported domains (Lloyds and Halifax, including staging and preview environments).

- **Future Enhancements:**  
  - Monitor usage to see if additional domains need to be supported.
  - Consider creating more granular configurations to allow non-developers to update default values (like the insurance code defaults) without modifying the JavaScript.

- **Documentation Updates:**  
  Keep this documentation in sync with any refactoring or additional features introduced in the extension.
