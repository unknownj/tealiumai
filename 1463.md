# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: LivePerson

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** LivePerson
- **ID:** 100040
- **Type:** Advanced Javascript Code
- **Scope:** 1072
- **Execution Frequency:** Continuous every 250ms (for as long as necessary until the event handlers are attached)

### Summary
This extension is designed to integrate with LivePerson's chat functionality by establishing event listeners for conversation information and state changes. Upon binding these events, it enables the tracking of chat interactions within LBG Analytics, enhancing the understanding of user engagement during live chats. 

---

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- `window.webchateventinterval`: A global variable that stores the interval ID to ensure event handlers are only attached once.
- `lpTag`: An object from LivePerson's library that manages chat interactions.
- `LBGAnalytics`: An object responsible for user engagement tracking.

### Logic Flow
1. The code first checks if `window.webchateventinterval` is undefined. If it is, it sets an interval every 250 milliseconds.
2. Within the interval function:
   - It checks if the `lpTag` object and its associated event handling capabilities are available.
   - If so, it clears the interval (ensuring that no further calls to this interval function are made) and logs a message indicating the event handlers are being attached.
   - It defines a handler function (`handlerFunction`) that interacts with the `LBGAnalytics` object to set the web chat context whenever chat events are triggered.
   - It binds the event handlers for the "conversationInfo" and "state" events to the `handlerFunction`.
3. An empty identities array is assigned to `lpTag.identities`, and a callback function pushing a `null` value is added to it.

### Dependencies
This extension relies on:
- `lpTag`: A global object provided by LivePerson's library.
- `LBGAnalytics`: Another global object used for tracking user interactions.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Normal Operation
When a user interacts with the web chat, the extension will successfully bind handlers to:
- the conversation information updates,
- the state of the chat (e.g., user typing, connected).

Upon any of these events, `handlerFunction` will execute and transmit relevant data to `LBGAnalytics`, allowing real-time tracking of user engagement.

### Scenario 2: Edge Case
If the `lpTag` or `LBGAnalytics` objects are not present:
- The extension will continue to loop every 250ms, checking for their existence until the event handlers are finally bound.
- This may lead to unnecessary processing requests and can be optimised to prevent excessive checks.

---

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Signal Delays**: The extension relies on set intervals, which may lead to minor delays in binding events. Under heavy load or poor network conditions, this might affect responsiveness.
- **Resource Heavy**: Continuous checking can affect performance, especially if `lpTag` and `LBGAnalytics` take longer to load than expected.
- **Conflicts**: This extension can conflict with other Tealium extensions that modify global objects, particularly those affecting `lpTag` or event-handling mechanisms.

---

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Avoiding Global State Pollution**: Encapsulate code within a local namespace to prevent conflicts with other scripts or extensions.
- **Interval Management**: Implement a mechanism to verify that the event listeners have been successfully attached before invoking a set interval. This will help avoid unnecessary performance costs.
- **Error Handling**: Alongside logging error messages, consider providing fallback behaviours or notifications to the user if critical components fail to load.
- **Code Modularity**: Break down the code into smaller functions for clearer structure and easier maintenance, while respecting ES5 syntax.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- Regularly test the extension after updates to the platform or related libraries to ensure no critical functionality is broken.
- Maintain ownership documentation to track changes made over time, who implemented them, and the reasons for changes.
- Conduct evaluations of the extensionâ€™s performance and responsiveness under various conditions, adapting as needed based on user feedback or analytics data.
