# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: LivePerson

This document provides a comprehensive guide for the Tealium iQ extension used for integrating LivePerson webchat events with LBGAnalytics. It covers an overview of the extension, detailed code explanations, usage scenarios, known limitations, refactoring recommendations, and maintenance notes.

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** LivePerson  
- **Extension ID:** 100040  
- **Type:** Advanced Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** 1072  
- **Execution Frequency:** Runs once on tag execution, with a repeated check (every 250ms) until certain global objects become available, then stops

**Summary:**  
This extension is designed to integrate LivePerson’s webchat events with the LBGAnalytics system. It continuously monitors for the availability of critical global objects (e.g. lpTag and LBGAnalytics) at runtime. Once these objects are detected, it clears the interval polling and attaches event handlers for webchat events. These event handlers, when triggered, pass webchat-related data to the LBGAnalytics context-setting functionality. Additionally, it pushes an identity callback onto lpTag.identities, ensuring that the identity chain is maintained even if no identifier is provided.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables and Global Objects
- **window.webchateventinterval:**  
  A globally defined variable that holds the reference to a setInterval timer. It is used to poll for the availability of required LivePerson and LBGAnalytics objects.

- **lpTag:**  
  Assumed to be a global object provided by the LivePerson integration library. It is used here to bind event handlers to webchat events.

- **LBGAnalytics:**  
  A global object referenced for setting the webchat context when a LivePerson event is received.

### Logic Flow
1. **Initialisation:**  
   The code is wrapped in an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) that takes three parameters which are expected to be provided by Tealium (eventType, eventPayload, tagObject).

2. **Polling for Dependency Availability:**  
   - The code first checks if the global `window.webchateventinterval` is undefined.  
   - If undefined, it creates an interval using `setInterval` set to run every 250 milliseconds.  
   - Within the interval function, it checks for the availability of `lpTag`, specifically:  
     - `lpTag.events` should exist,  
     - `lpTag.events.bind` should be a function, and  
     - `LBGAnalytics` should also be available.

3. **Clearing the Polling and Attaching Handlers:**  
   - Once all required objects are available, the interval is cleared using `clearInterval`.
   - A console message ("Attaching Webchat Event Handlers") is logged.
   - A handler function (`handlerFunction`) is defined. This function takes parameters `response` and `info` and calls `window.LBGAnalytics.data.setWebchatContext` with those values.
   - The event handler is bound to two events on the LivePerson unified chat window: `"conversationInfo"` and `"state"` using `lpTag.events.bind`.

4. **Identity Callback:**  
   - Post event binding, the code ensures the `lpTag.identities` array exists (initialises it to an empty array if necessary).
   - It then pushes a new function onto this array that simply calls its callback with `null` as the parameter, indicating that no additional identity is provided.

5. **Error Handling:**  
   - Try-catch blocks are used to handle exceptions both in the outer code (covering the whole function) and within the interval’s callback.  
   - Caught errors are logged to the console.

### Dependencies
- Relies on global availability and proper initialisation of:  
  - `lpTag` and its members (`events`, `bind`).  
  - `LBGAnalytics` and its member (`data.setWebchatContext`).

## 3. Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Normal Operation
- **Setup:**  
  The web page loads and the required global objects (`lpTag` and `LBGAnalytics`) initialise as expected.
  
- **Data Flow:**  
  - The extension starts and sets an interval to check for the availability of the required globals.
  - Once detected, it attaches event handlers for `"conversationInfo"` and `"state"`.
  - When a chat event occurs, LivePerson triggers an event; the corresponding handler receives a `response` and `info`.
  - The handler passes these parameters to `LBGAnalytics.data.setWebchatContext` to update the analytics context.
  
- **Result:**  
  The analytics system receives detailed updates based on the webchat events.

### Scenario 2: Delayed Dependency Loading
- **Setup:**  
  The globals `lpTag` and/or `LBGAnalytics` load with a delay.

- **Data Flow:**  
  - The extension continually polls (every 250ms) until the objects become available.
  - Once available, it clears the interval and attaches the event handlers.
  
- **Result:**  
  Event handlers are attached even though there was a delay, ensuring deferred processing of webchat events.

### Scenario 3: Edge Case – Dependency Never Loads
- **Setup:**  
  In an unusual situation, if `lpTag` or `LBGAnalytics` fails to load at all.

- **Data Flow:**  
  - The extension continues to poll indefinitely, logging errors if exceptions occur.
  - The event handlers are never attached.
  
- **Result:**  
  The analytics context is never updated, and the system should implement additional monitoring or fallback logic as necessary.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Indefinite Polling:**  
  If the required global objects never initialise, the interval will continue running indefinitely, which may cause performance issues over prolonged time periods.

- **Dependency on Global Objects:**  
  The extension strictly depends on the external libraries (`lpTag` and `LBGAnalytics`). Any changes or updates to these libraries could break the extension.

- **Error Handling is Basic:**  
  Errors are simply logged to the console. In a production environment, more robust error reporting might be necessary.

- **Potential Conflict with Other Extensions:**  
  Since multiple Tealium extensions might create or manipulate `lpTag` or `LBGAnalytics`, ensure that the order of execution does not affect the intended behaviour, and that no other extension inadvertently clears or overwrites these globals.

---

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Avoid Indefinite Polling:**  
  Consider implementing a maximum number of retries or a timeout mechanism to prevent endless polling in cases where required globals never load.

- **Modularise Code:**  
  Refactor the code into smaller, clearly defined functions. This could help with testing and readability. For example, create separate functions for:  
  - Polling for dependencies  
  - Attaching event handlers  
  - Handling identity callbacks

- **Enhanced Error Handling:**  
  Consider creating a utility function for error logging to uniformly handle errors and possibly alert the system if critical functionalities are not working as expected.

- **Commenting & Documentation:**  
  Add in-line comments describing each significant part of the code. This will assist future developers in understanding the logic flow and debugging issues.

- **Maintain ES5 Compliance:**  
  Ensure that all syntax remains compliant with ES5 standards. Avoid using ES2015+ features such as arrow functions, template literals, let/const, etc., to remain in line with project requirements.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Testing:**  
  Regularly test the extension in various environments, especially when updates are made to external dependencies like LivePerson or LBGAnalytics libraries.

- **Ownership:**  
  Clearly define who is responsible for the maintenance of this extension. Consider adding documentation comments within the code that indicate the last update and maintainer contact information.

- **Monitoring:**  
  Implement monitoring mechanisms in production to alert when the extension fails to attach handlers due to missing dependencies. This could be tied into existing analytics or log monitoring statements.

- **Version Control:**  
  Keep this documentation up to date with any changes made to the extension code. Use version control comments within the code base to link changes with updates in this documentation.

- **Integration Testing:**  
  Whenever integration points (such as global objects or external libraries) are updated, include this extension in full regression testing to ensure compatibility.
