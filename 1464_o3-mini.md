# GForms Override Extension Documentation

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** GForms Override  
- **ID:** 1464  
- **Extension Type:** Advanced Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** 928  
- **Execution Frequency:** The code is executed on page load when the specific conditions (i.e. certain URL paths) are met.

**Summary:**  
The GForms Override extension is designed to intercept page loads matching specific URL patterns (related to GForms) and capture form-related analytics data. It extracts data such as the form ID, the associated journey name, journey product, journey step number, and step name. The extension utilises local storage to persist and update these data values, then exposes them on the global object for other scripts to read. Its primary purpose is to standardise analytics capture for Google Forms-like interactions that occur on different URL paths.

------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Code Explanation

### Global Variables and Parameters:
- **a, b, u:** The parameters passed into the immediately-invoked function expression (IIFE). Typically:
  - `a` represents `eventType`
  - `b` represents `eventPayload` (and also carries additional page data such as `CanonicalPath`)
  - `u` is likely to correspond to `tagObject` but is unused in the current code.

### URL Path Conditions:
- The code first checks if the global `CanonicalPath` property (part of the eventPayload object `b`) contains either `/a/gforms` or `/a/common/gforms`.
- It then exits early (`return;`) if `CanonicalPath` also contains `"gformscwm.jsp"`. This prevents further execution for that specific page.

### Determining the Journey Step:
- A mapping object, `formToJourney`, maps known form IDs (e.g. `"F065"`) to human-readable names (e.g. `"Loan Repayment Holiday"`).
- The variable `journeyStep` is initialised to 1 and then conditionally updated:
  - If `"multi"` is found in the URL, `journeyStep` is set to 2.
  - If `"outcome"` is found in the URL, it is set to 3.
  - If `"review"` or `"hub"` are present, `journeyStep` is set to 0.
  
### The GFormsData Object:
- This object is used as a temporary store for analytics values. It contains:
  - A `save` method: Serialises and persists the current state in local storage under the key `"GFormsAnalytics"`.
  - A `load` method: Retrieves and applies stored values from local storage, while avoiding overwriting the methods (`save`, `load`, and `set`).
  - A `set` method: Updates a property and then calls `save` to persist the change. It also honours an optional flag (`o`) to decide whether to overwrite an existing value.

### Data Loading and Error Handling:
- For journeys where the step is greater than 1, the code attempts to load previous data from local storage. Any errors during parsing are silently caught.

### Extracting Form Data:
1. **Form ID Extraction:**
   - It searches through `<script>` tags for a string containing `"formId="`.
   - The form ID is extracted by splitting the text after `"formId="` until the ampersand (`&`) is found.
2. **Form Name Extraction:**
   - It attempts to extract the text from the first `<h1>` element as the form name.

### Setting Analytics Data:
- The extension uses the `GFormsData.set` method to store:
  - `JourneyName`: Either a mapped journey name from `formToJourney` or the extracted form name, prepended with `"GForm "`.
  - `JourneyProduct`: The extracted form ID.
  - `JourneyStep`: The calculated journey step (with forced update).
  - `JourneyStepName`: Again derived from the `<h1>` contents, with forced update.
  
### Exposing Data Globaly:
- Finally, the extension iterates over properties in `GFormsData` (ignoring any functions) and applies each value to the global event payload object `b`. This makes the data available for further processing by other extensions or scripts.

### Dependencies:
- **jQuery:** The script relies on jQuery (`$`) to select elements and traverse the DOM.
- **Local Storage API:** It requires the browser’s `localStorage` for data persistence.
- **Global Objects:** It accesses `CanonicalPath` from `eventPayload` (passed as `b`).

------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Usage Examples

### Example 1: Standard GForm Page Load
- **Scenario:** A user loads a page with URL `/a/gforms/page1`.
- **Data Flow:**
  - The extension verifies the URL contains `/a/gforms` so it will run.
  - It extracts the form ID from any `<script>` tag containing `"formId="`.
  - The journey step is left at 1 unless URL contains keywords that change the value.
  - The journey name is set to either the mapped name from `formToJourney` (if applicable) or the `<h1>` text.
  - Analytics data are saved to local storage and merged into the event payload.
  
### Example 2: Multi-Step Journey
- **Scenario:** A user continues on a page with URL including `"multi"`.
- **Data Flow:**
  - The extension starts by loading any previously saved analytics data.
  - It then updates the journey step to 2.
  - The rest of the data (form id, name, etc.) is processed similarly.
  
### Example 3: Early Exit on Specific Page
- **Scenario:** A user loads a page with URL containing `"gformscwm.jsp"`.
- **Data Flow:**
  - Although the URL might contain `/a/gforms`, the extension immediately returns without processing any analytics, due to the early exit condition.

------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **URL Dependency:**  
  The code relies heavily on the URL (via `CanonicalPath`) for determining form context and journey steps. If URL structures change, the extension’s logic might need adjustments.

- **Missing or Incorrect Data:**  
  If the expected elements (such as `<script>` tags with `"formId="` or `<h1>` elements) are absent, the extraction logic will silently fail, potentially resulting in incorrect or missing analytics data.

- **Local Storage Parsing:**  
  Any corruption in local storage data (e.g. manually altered, or cross-domain storage conflicts) might cause JSON parsing errors, though errors are caught and ignored.

- **Dependency on jQuery:**  
  This extension assumes that jQuery is available. If other scripts remove or modify jQuery, it could lead to failures.

- **Global Namespace Pollution:**  
  The final loop copies properties from `GFormsData` into the main event payload object `b`, which might potentially conflict with other variables or extensions if not carefully coordinated.

------------------------------------------------------------

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks:**  
  While existence of `eventType` and `eventPayload` is guaranteed, consider adding defensive checks on:
  - The presence of the `CanonicalPath` property.
  - Validity of jQuery selectors (e.g. checking if `$("h1")` returns an element).

- **Modularisation:**  
  Consider breaking the code into smaller, reusable functions. For example:
  - A dedicated function for extracting the form ID.
  - A separate function for determining the journey step.
  - A module for handling local storage interactions.

- **Error Logging:**  
  Instead of silently catching errors (with empty catch blocks), log errors to the console (or another error reporting tool) during development. This practice will help track unexpected failures.

- **Code Style Improvements:**  
  Although ES5 is required, ensure code style consistency through:
  - Proper indentation.
  - Consistent use of semicolons.
  - Adding inline comments on critical sections to aid readability.

------------------------------------------------------------

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  - Document any changes to the URL structure or form elements to ensure the extension’s logic remains valid.
  - Regularly review dependency updates, especially related to jQuery and browser APIs.
  - Consider writing unit tests or integration tests that simulate different URL conditions and local storage scenarios.

- **Ownership:**  
  - Assign a dedicated team or individual to maintain this extension’s code, ensuring that there is clarity on the update cycle and change management.
  
- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Test across major browsers to confirm consistent behaviour, particularly with respect to local storage handling.
  - Verify functionality both in the absence and presence of expected DOM elements.
  - Use the browser’s developer tools to inspect and verify that the analytics data (e.g. JourneyName, JourneyProduct, etc.) are correctly being attached to the global event payload.

- **Documentation Updates:**  
  Ensure that any refactoring or changes to the URL schema, storage keys, or extraction logic are promptly documented in this document.
