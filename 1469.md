# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation - Lead Catch-Up

## 1. Extension Overview
- **Name**: Lead Catch-Up
- **ID**: 1469
- **Type**: Advanced Javascript Code
- **Scope**: 928
- **Execution Frequency**: On Event Trigger

### Summary
The Lead Catch-Up extension is designed to gather and consolidate specific lead impressions from web page elements and append them to a consolidated list of impressions. It filters and processes the impressions to prevent duplicates, ensuring accurate tracking of user engagements with leads.

---

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- **latestImpressions**: An array containing unique lead impressions extracted from specific classes assigned to DOM elements loaded by the LBGAnalytics library.

### Logic Flow
1. **Selection of Elements**: The code begins by selecting all elements with the class "webTrends".
2. **Class Extraction**: It retrieves the class attributes of these elements and filters them to find classes that contain both "WTData:" and "WT.ac=".
3. **Value Extraction**: The code splits these class strings to extract the actual lead impression values associated with "WT.ac=" and ignores any duplicates already listed in the `LeadImpressions` data layer.
4. **Consolidation**: If new lead impressions are found, they are printed to the console, and then these values are appended to an existing consolidated impressions string, separating each value with a semicolon.

### Dependencies
- This code relies on the **LBGAnalytics** object, which appears to be a jQuery-like library for DOM manipulation.
- The extension also makes use of the **window.clova3.datalayer** object to access and manipulate the current lead impressions stored in the data layer.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Condition
When a user navigates to a page with elements tagged with "webTrends" that contain valid lead impression classes, the extension will successfully extract these classes, append new lead impressions, and log the count of new impressions acquired.

### Edge Conditions
1. **No New Impressions**: If the page contains elements with classes that do not match the required format or if all matched impressions are already recorded in `LeadImpressions`, no new impressions will be added, and no console log will be generated.
2. **Data Layer Unavailability**: If the `LeadImpressions` entry does not exist or is malformed, the filter will still function correctly, and new impressions will be appended without duplicates from the existing values.

---

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- If there are a significant number of matching impressions, the performance may degrade due to extensive DOM manipulation and string operations.
- The extension assumes that impressions are represented as strings that can be denoted by "WT.ac=" and handles only one delimiter (";"). Multiple delimiters could break functionality.
- Conflicts may arise if other extensions manipulate the same `window.clova3.datalayer` or if multiple elements share similar class naming but are not intended to represent lead impressions.

---

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Modularisation**: Consider breaking down the logic into smaller, reusable functions. For instance, a dedicated function for extracting lead impressions could make the code clearer.
- **Variable Naming**: Enhance clarity by using more descriptive variable names to indicate the content or purpose of the data being handled.
- **Defensive Checks**: Implement checks to ensure that the expected class formats are adhered to before string manipulation to prevent runtime errors.
- **Documentation Comments**: Add inline comments throughout the code to explain complex sections or important decisions for future reference.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

### Ongoing Maintenance
- Regular reviews should be scheduled to ensure the extension remains compatible with updates to the LBGAnalytics library or the website's class structures.
- Monitor for changes in the data layer's format to guarantee consistent lead impression consolidation.

### Ownership
- Designate a team or individual responsible for maintaining this extension. They should ensure that any necessary updates are made promptly and that performance metrics are regularly reviewed.

### Testing Guidelines
- Integrate unit tests to cover various scenarios, especially for edge conditions.
- Conduct performance profiling to measure impacts on load times and rendering, especially under heavy traffic conditions.
