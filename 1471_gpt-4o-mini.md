# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: OCIS ID

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name**: OCIS ID
- **ID**: 100040
- **Type**: Advanced JavaScript Code
- **Scope**: After Load Rules
- **Execution Frequency**: Run Always

### Summary
The OCIS ID extension retrieves and processes the “OCIS ID” value from specific input fields in the DOM. It primarily captures customer identifiers to ensure consistency across various tracking mechanisms. The extension addresses a common issue where the OCIS ID may be presented in varying capitalisations and standardises it by storing it in a consistent format. Additionally, it sets up a fallback mechanism to populate the `OtherCustomerID` if it is not already defined.

---

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- `b.OCISID`: This variable stores the OCIS ID value retrieved from the DOM.
- `b.OtherCustomerID`: This variable is used to store a fallback identifier based on the OCIS ID.
- `b.OtherCustomerIDType`: This variable defines the type of the customer ID, which is set to "OCIS".

### Logic Flow
1. The extension begins by attempting to retrieve the value of OCIS ID from:
   - An input field using `clova2.$("input[name=ocisId]").val()`.
   - An attribute from another element using `clova2.$("#o4bPartyEntityId").attr("value")`.
   
2. It then performs a loop over the properties of the object `b` to check for the lowercase equivalent of the key "ocisid". If such a key exists and does not correspond to the standard capitalisation while `b.OCISID` remains undefined, it assigns that value to `b.OCISID`.

3. Next, there is a check to see if `b.OtherCustomerID` is not defined. If `b.OCISID` is present, it assigns the value of `b.OCISID` to `b.OtherCustomerID` and sets `b.OtherCustomerIDType` to "OCIS".

### Dependencies
- **clova2**: This extension relies on the presence of the `clova2` library or object for DOM manipulations and queries.
- **eventType** and **eventPayload**: These global variables are guaranteed to be present and are passed into the IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression).

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Conditions
When an OCIS ID is correctly filled in the specified input field:
1. The input `$("input[name=ocisId]")` has a value of “12345”.
2. The extension runs, and `b.OCISID` becomes “12345”.
3. If `b.OtherCustomerID` is not defined, it will be set to “12345” with `b.OtherCustomerIDType` as “OCIS”.

### Edge Conditions
1. If both DOM queries return null or undefined, and `b.OCISID` remains undefined, no actions occur, and `b.OtherCustomerID` will not be set.
2. If the OCIS ID is in a different case, for example, “ocisid” (lowercase), the loop will correct it, ensuring `b.OCISID` is set correctly.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- The extension depends heavily on the availability of `clova2`. If this library is not loaded or available, the extension will fail silently and may not execute as intended.
- The loop that checks for the existence of a lowercase “ocisid” can cause conflicts if there are multiple properties on `b` whose names are similar, creating confusion about which value should be captured.
- There may be performance concerns if the `b` object has a high number of properties, although this is generally unlikely.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Code Style**: Consider adding comments to clarify the purpose of each significant section and ensure consistency in naming conventions.
  
- **Modularisation**: Although the code is meant to support ES5, consider splitting out the logic into reusable functions if the extension grows more complex in the future.
  
- **Defensive Checks**: While it’s stated that eventType and eventPayload are guaranteed to be present, further validation could be useful if requirements change or in future versions.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ownership**: Assign a dedicated owner for this extension to monitor its performance and address any issues that arise.
  
- **Testing Guidelines**: Implement unit tests to validate the retrieval and assignment logic in various scenarios, especially ensuring that the monitoring of `OtherCustomerID` is functioning as expected.
  
- **Documentation**: Keep this documentation updated with any changes to the extension logic or external dependencies to aid in future development and troubleshooting efforts.

This structured documentation is intended to provide clear guidance for developers and stakeholders involved with the Tealium iQ extension for OCIS ID, ensuring clarity of purpose, functionality, and maintainability.
