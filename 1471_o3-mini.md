# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation - "OCIS ID"

This document provides an in-depth overview and analysis of the "OCIS ID" extension coded for Tealium iQ. It covers the extension overview, a detailed code explanation, usage examples, known limitations and gotchas, recommendations for refactoring, and maintenance guidelines.

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** OCIS ID  
- **ID:** 1471 (Extension Identifier)  
- **Type:** Advanced Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** After Load Rules  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Always  

**Summary:**  
The "OCIS ID" extension is designed to extract, normalise, and assign a unique customer identifier (OCIS ID) from various possible input sources on the page. The extension attempts to retrieve the OCIS ID from form inputs and DOM elements, ensuring that even if the identifier is present in a different property case, it is captured and standardised. Additionally, if no OtherCustomerID is set but an OCIS ID is present, it assigns OCIS as the customer ID type. This ensures that customer identification is maintained consistently across the analytics events processed by Tealium iQ.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- **eventType:** The first parameter passed to the IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression). Although not utilised within the code, it may represent the type of event being processed.
- **eventPayload:** The second parameter, referred to as `b` in the function; it holds data payload that contains customer identifiers and other related properties.
- **clova2:** A global library (or object) used to fetch values from input fields in the DOM. Two different DOM query methods are shown:
  - `clova2.$("input[name=ocisId]").val()`: Retrieves the value of an input with the name attribute `ocisId`.
  - `clova2.$("#o4bPartyEntityId").attr("value")`: Retrieves the value attribute of an element with the id `o4bPartyEntityId`.

### Logic Flow
1. **Initial OCIS ID Assignment:**  
   The extension first attempts to assign a value to the `OCISID` property of the `eventPayload` (b). It uses either of the two methods provided by the `clova2` library to fetch the value from the DOM.
   - If neither input provides a valid value, the `OCISID` remains undefined or false.

2. **Case Insensitive Check:**  
   - The code iterates through each property on the `eventPayload` (b) using a `for` loop.
   - It checks if any property name converts to lowercase equals "ocisid" and is not exactly equal to the uppercase "OCISID".  
   - If such a property is found and `OCISID` has not already been set, the code assigns its value to `OCISID`.  
   This ensures that any misspelt or mis-cased identifier is caught and normalised.

3. **Assigning OtherCustomerID:**  
   - The code then checks if `OtherCustomerID` is not yet set and if `OCISID` is available.
   - On success, it assigns the `OCISID` value to `OtherCustomerID` and sets `OtherCustomerIDType` to "OCIS".  
   This standardises the customer identifier in the event payload for further analytics processing.

### Dependencies
- **clova2 Library:**  
  The extension relies on the global `clova2` object to perform DOM queries. It is assumed that this library is loaded and available before the extension runs.
- **Global Objects:**  
  The variables `eventType` and `eventPayload` are guaranteed to be available as inputs to the function.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Flow Example
- **Scenario:** A web page has an input element with `name="ocisId"` having the value `"12345ABC"`.
- **Process:**  
  - The extension retrieves `"12345ABC"` using `clova2.$("input[name=ocisId]").val()`.
  - It skips the loop if no other lowercase mis-cased entry exists.
  - Since `OtherCustomerID` is not already set, it assigns `"12345ABC"` to both `OtherCustomerID` and sets `OtherCustomerIDType` to `"OCIS"`.
- **Outcome:**  
  The event payload now has the properties:
  - OCISID: "12345ABC"
  - OtherCustomerID: "12345ABC"
  - OtherCustomerIDType: "OCIS"

### Edge Flow Example (Mis-cased Property)
- **Scenario:** A web page does not have an input with name `ocisId`, but the event payload contains a property `"ocisid"` (all lowercase) with the value `"98765XYZ"`.
- **Process:**  
  - The initial assignment does not retrieve a value via the DOM.
  - The for-loop iterates through properties and finds `k = "ocisid"` (which in lowercase equals `"ocisid"`) and since `b.OCISID` is still falsy, assigns `"98765XYZ"` to `OCISID`.
  - Then, `OtherCustomerID` is set to `"98765XYZ"` and `OtherCustomerIDType` to `"OCIS"`.
- **Outcome:**  
  The event payload now has the properties:
  - OCISID: "98765XYZ"
  - OtherCustomerID: "98765XYZ"
  - OtherCustomerIDType: "OCIS"

### Edge Flow Example (Both Sources Present)
- **Scenario:** Both a DOM element value and a mis-cased property exist.
- **Assumption:**  
  The DOM element retrieval (via `clova2`) returns a valid value `"DOM123"` and an event payload property `"ocisid"` holds `"PAYLOAD456"`.
- **Process:**  
  - The code initially assigns `"DOM123"` from the DOM.
  - The for-loop checks for lowercase properties but does not overwrite the value since `b.OCISID` is already set.
  - `OtherCustomerID` is set based on `"DOM123"`.
- **Outcome:**  
  The event payload prioritises the DOM value, so:
  - OCISID: "DOM123"
  - OtherCustomerID: "DOM123"
  - OtherCustomerIDType: "OCIS"

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Assumption of Global Objects:**  
  The extension depends on the global `clova2` object being loaded and available. If this is not the case, the extension will fail to retrieve the required DOM values.
  
- **Case Sensitivity:**  
  Although the extension handles mis-cased properties by iterating over the keys, it depends on the property names being similar enough ("ocisid"). If there is a significant deviation in naming, the pattern will not catch it.

- **DOM Element Availability:**  
  The code assumes the presence of specific DOM elements (`input[name=ocisId]`, `#o4bPartyEntityId`) at execution time. If these elements are not present or are dynamically loaded later, the retrieval will fail.

- **Potential Conflicts:**  
  There may be potential conflicts if other Tealium extensions or external scripts manipulate the `OtherCustomerID` or `OCISID` properties within the same event payload. No namespacing is applied within this extension to isolate its data.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Code Modularisation:**  
  Consider extracting the case-insensitive checking logic into a clearly defined helper function. This will improve readability and facilitate unit testing.

- **Defensive Checks:**  
  Although eventType and eventPayload are guaranteed by Tealium, it is important to ensure that `clova2` is available to avoid runtime errors. A simple check for `if (typeof clova2 !== "undefined")` may be beneficial if there is any possibility of deployment in environments where it could be missing.

- **Comments and Documentation:**  
  Enhance inline comments to explain why specific operations (especially the lower-case check) are required. This makes maintenance easier for future developers.

- **Code Style Consistency:**  
  Ensure that the code follows best practices for ES5, such as using the `var` keyword consistently for variable declarations, and maintaining clear and concise inline comments.

- **Testing Enhancements:**  
  Incorporate unit tests that simulate different DOM states (with input elements missing or mis-cased properties) to ensure robust handling of edge conditions.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Testing:**  
  Regularly test the extension in both staging and production environments to ensure it behaves as expected especially after modifications to the DOM structure or when new analytics fields are added.

- **Ownership:**  
  Assign the extension to a dedicated team member or group responsible for customer data integrity. Ownership ensures that any discrepancies or issues are quickly resolved and documented.

- **Version Control:**  
  Maintain version control for the extension code. Document any changes made along with reasons and details of the update process. Use comments in the code to indicate change history and date of modifications (as seen with the "2020-11-19" note).

- **Dependencies Documentation:**  
  Clearly document the dependency on external libraries such as `clova2`, including their version and any specific configuration required to ensure compatibility.

- **Integration Points:**  
  Keep a record of how this extension interacts with other Tealium iQ extensions, especially those that may also manipulate or rely on customer ID values. This helps in troubleshooting any unexpected behaviour.
