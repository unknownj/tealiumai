# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: Offsite Links

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name**: Offsite Links
- **ID**: 100040
- **Type**: Advanced Javascript Code
- **Scope**: DOM Ready
- **Execution Frequency**: Run Once

### Summary
The "Offsite Links" extension is designed to track user interactions with offsite links on specific pages of a website. It automatically modifies links to open in a new tab and sends an analytics event upon user clicks. The extension minimizes tracking on the main site, focusing instead on outbound links from relevant help and guidance pages related to coronavirus and insurance. This is particularly useful for monitoring user engagement with offsite resources without impacting performance on the primary site.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- **$**: A reference to the jQuery library (assumed to be injected in the global scope).
- **utag.data.Brand**: A global variable that stores brand information, used for filtering.

### Logic Flow
1. **Link Selection**: The extension selects all anchor (`<a>`) elements that have an `href` attribute.
2. **Initial Filtering**:
   - It filters links to keep those that do not form part of the current hostname or the brand's domain.
   - It explicitly allows links containing "insure-systems" to track interactions, irrespective of brand domain filters.
3. **Tracking Setup**:
   - For the filtered links, if they do not have a `target` attribute, it sets them to open in a new tab (`target="_blank"`).
   - A click event is attached to these links, which triggers an analytics event containing the link's text and URL when clicked.
4. **Conditional Execution**: The entire logic is executed based on the current page's pathname. It specifically targets pages related to coronavirus help and insurance.

### Dependencies
- **jQuery**: The extension requires jQuery to manipulate DOM elements.
- **LBGAnalytics**: This library is assumed to be available for sending events.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Conditions
- When a user clicks on an offsite link in the COVID-19 support sections, the link opens in a new tab, and an analytics event is fired capturing the link text and URL.

### Edge Conditions
- On pages unrelated to the defined paths for coronavirus or insurance, the extension will not execute, and no links will be modified or tracked.
- If the current hostname is part of "insure-systems", links within the insurance pages will be ignored by filtering, which leads to no external links being tracked on these pages.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Hostname Filtering**: If the extension is implemented on multiple subdomains, ensure correct `hostname` filtering.
- **No Error Handling**: The catch block in the main execution context silently absorbs errors, making debugging difficult if something goes wrong.
- **Dynamic Content**: If links are added dynamically after the DOM is ready (e.g., through AJAX), they will not be tracked since the code only runs once on the initial page load.
- **Conflicts with Other Scripts**: Ensure that other scripts do not alter the `click` events or `href` attributes of links after this extension runs.

---

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Modularisation**: Consider breaking the code into smaller, reusable functions for improved readability and maintainability. For instance, separate the logic for filtering links from the event binding.
- **Defensive Checks**: Implement checks to ensure `utag.data.Brand` exists before using it to avoid potential reference errors.
- **Logging for Debugging**: Instead of ignoring errors in the catch block, consider implementing a logging mechanism to capture significant failures or anomalies (for example, using `console.log`).
- **Event Handling**: Rather than directly binding click events in the mapping function, consider delegating events or encapsulating the click event handler for better performance in a dynamic content environment.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ownership**: Assign a dedicated developer or team responsible for the ongoing management of this extension.
- **Testing**: Regularly test the extension across various browsers and devices to ensure compatibility, especially whenever updates are made.
- **Documentation Updates**: Keep this document updated as changes or enhancements are made to the extension code to maintain clarity for future developers.
