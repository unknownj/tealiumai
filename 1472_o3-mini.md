# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: Offsite Links

This document provides a comprehensive overview and explanation for the "Offsite Links" Tealium iQ extension. It covers the extension’s purpose, inner workings, usage scenarios, limitations, and recommendations for future improvements.

---

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Offsite Links  
- **Extension ID:** 100040 (Internal ID: 1472)  
- **Type:** Advanced Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** DOM Ready  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Once  

**Summary:**  
The extension is designed to monitor anchor (a) elements on a webpage to identify offsite (external) links. When a qualifying link is clicked, the extension opens the link in a new browser tab (if not already configured) and sends a tracking event using the LBGAnalytics.events.send method. The tracking event records details such as the event type ("External Click"), action ("Offsite Link"), the text content of the link, and the link target (URL). This behaviour ensures that offsite interactions are detected and measured, providing valuable insights into user engagement with external resources.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables and Functions

- **addOffsiteLinkTracking($):**  
  A function that accepts a jQuery-like object. It processes all anchor elements on the page with an href attribute and attaches click event handlers for tracking external link clicks.

- **Dependencies:**  
  The extension relies on the following global objects and external libraries:
  - **jQuery (or a jQuery-compatible library):** Passed via `window.clova2.$` for element selection and manipulation.
  - **utag.data.Brand:** Used to determine whether the link URL contains the current brand name (in lowercase) for filtering purposes.
  - **LBGAnalytics:** A global analytics object used for sending event tracking data.
  - **window.location:** URL object to determine the current page pathname and hostname for conditional logic.
  
### Logic Flow

1. **Link Selection:**  
   - The function selects all `<a>` elements with an `href` attribute using `$("a[href]")`.

2. **Initial Filtering:**  
   - A filtering operation retains only those links whose `href` attribute contains a forward slash (`/`) beyond the first character. This is intended to discard relative/special links that do not represent external resources.

3. **Conditional Filtering:**  
   - The second filter applies additional conditions:
     - If the current hostname contains the sub-string "scottish", the link is excluded.
     - If the link's `href` does not include the current brand name (in lowercase) or if the `href` contains "insure-systems", the link is considered external.
     - Otherwise, the link is ignored.

4. **Processing Each Link:**  
   - For each link that passes the filters:
     - If the link does not have a `target` attribute, it is set to `_blank` to ensure it opens in a new tab/window.
     - A click event handler is attached to send a tracking event with parameters:
       - **JourneyEvent:** "External Click"
       - **EventAction:** "Offsite Link"
       - **EventNarrative:** The text of the link (`$(a).text()`)
       - **ResourceFileName:** The link URL from `$(a).attr("href")`

5. **Conditional Invocation:**  
   - Outside the function, conditional logic determines when to apply the tracking:
     - The extension checks the `window.location.pathname` for specific patterns (e.g. starting with `/helpcentre/coronavirus`, `/help-guidance/coronavirus`, `/support/coronavirus`).
     - Also, if the pathname includes "insurance" and the hostname does not contain "insure-systems", the tracking function is triggered.
     - In all these cases, the function is called using the jQuery object available as `window.clova2.$`.

6. **Error Handling:**  
   - Both the core logic (inside the click event handler) and the global invocation of the function are wrapped in try/catch blocks to prevent JavaScript errors from breaking other parts of the application.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Scenario

- **Example:** A user visits a support page with the pathname `/support/coronavirus`. The page includes multiple anchor tags with external links.
  - The function `addOffsiteLinkTracking` is triggered using `window.clova2.$`.
  - Each anchor element that does not include the current brand (or meets the condition for "insure-systems") gets a click event handler attached.
  - When the user clicks an offsite link:
    - If the link doesn’t already have a target, it is updated to open in a new tab.
    - A tracking event is sent via `LBGAnalytics.events.send` with relevant details.

### Edge Conditions

- **Hostname Exception:**  
  - If the URL’s hostname contains "scottish", the second filter in the function immediately returns false for every link, so no event handlers are added.
  
- **Insurance Page Exception:**  
  - For pages with a pathname that includes "insurance":
    - The function is only called if the hostname does not include "insure-systems". This prevents duplicate or unwanted tracking on pages that are exceptions.

- **No hrefs or Links Failing the Filter:**  
  - If no anchor elements match the filtering criteria, the function runs without adding any event listeners and no tracking event is sent.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Reliance on Global Objects:**  
  - The code highly depends on external globals (`window.clova2.$`, `utag.data.Brand`, `LBGAnalytics`). If any of these are missing or renamed, the extension will fail silently.
  
- **DOM Ready Scope:**  
  - Since the extension is set to run on DOM Ready, dynamically loaded content via AJAX might not be processed unless additional handling is implemented.

- **Cross-Domain Tracking Issues:**  
  - Opening external links in a new tab may not preserve session or context information, which might be desired in some analytics scenarios.

- **Edge String Matching:**  
  - The filtering using string index checks (e.g. checking for "/" in the href) may inadvertently include or exclude certain valid links.
  - The method `indexOf` may yield false positives if any substring condition is met unintentionally.

- **Error Silencing:**  
  - Errors in the tracking call (`LBGAnalytics.events.send`) are caught and silently ignored, making debugging more difficult if analytics events consistently fail.

---

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Improved Defensive Coding:**
  - Although the availability of properties like `eventType` and `eventPayload` is guaranteed, consider adding checks for external objects:
    - Verify that `window.clova2` and `window.clova2.$` exist before proceeding.
    - Confirm that `utag.data.Brand` is a valid string before running indexOf comparisons.
    - Ensure `LBGAnalytics.events` is defined before calling `send`.

- **Modularisation:**
  - Encapsulate filtering logic into helper functions (while staying within ES5 constraints) to improve readability.
  - Consider separating the event tracking logic from the link transformation logic to simplify unit testing.

- **Enhanced Filtering:**
  - Refine string matching conditions by using more precise checks. For instance, consider using regular expressions (supported in ES5) rather than multiple indexOf calls.
  
- **Logging and Error Reporting:**
  - Instead of silently catching errors, optionally include logging in development mode to monitor failures in the tracking process.

- **Document Dependency Requirements:**
  - Clearly state in documentation that this extension requires global objects (`window.clova2.$`, `utag.data.Brand`, `LBGAnalytics`) to be present and correctly configured.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**
  - Regularly check compatibility with any updates to global libraries such as jQuery, Tealium’s utag, and LBGAnalytics.
  - Monitor changes in site structure (e.g. URL patterns, hostname changes) that could affect the conditional logic around when the extension is activated.
  - Maintain comprehensive unit tests for the filtering logic and tracking calls to ensure continued accuracy.

- **Ownership & Testing Guidelines:**
  - Assign a developer or team with analytics expertise to regularly review and test the extension.
  - Use staging environments to validate changes before deployment, especially when new URL structures or analytics systems are introduced.
  - Document any changes or issues encountered with logs or issue tracking systems for future reference.

- **Further Enhancements:**
  - Evaluate the possibility of supporting dynamically loaded content either via mutation observers or by re-triggering the function as needed.
  - Consider adding configuration options within Tealium’s interface for adjusting filtering criteria without code changes.
