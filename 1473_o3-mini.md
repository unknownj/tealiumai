# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: Event Timings

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the “Event Timings” extension, including its purpose, code logic, sample scenarios, potential pitfalls, refactoring recommendations, and maintenance guidelines.

---

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Event Timings
- **ID:** 1473 (Extension reference via extensionId: 100040 in the metadata block)
- **Type:** Advanced Javascript Code
- **Scope:** Before Load Rules
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Always

**Summary:**  
The Event Timings extension is designed to capture and measure the timing of specific page events. It sets timestamps for when a page is loaded and when a view event occurs. It then computes the elapsed time since these events occurred, ensuring the calculated intervals are valid only for up to 10 minutes after the original event. This information is applied to various analytics events via keys like "aa.event601", "aa.event602", and "aa.event603". The extension is vital for tracking performance metrics and real-time analytics data for user interactions on the page.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables

- **now:**  
  A variable holding the current timestamp in milliseconds using `new Date().getTime()`.

- **b:**  
  Represents the `eventPayload` which is assumed to be a mutable data object (a data layer) where the timestamps and timing values are stored.

- **a:**  
  Represents the `eventType`, a string that determines the logic path (for example, "view" triggers special handling).

- **LBGAnalytics.datalayer:**  
  A global analytics object that provides a method `set()` used to update the data layer with new key/value pairs. This is a dependency and must be defined in the global scope.

### Logic Flow

1. **Timestamp Initialization:**  
   - The current timestamp is stored as `now`.
   - The code first checks if `PageLoadTimeStamp` is undefined on the data layer object (`b`). This check ensures that the timestamp values are only set once, during the initial page load.

2. **Setting Initial Timestamps:**  
   - If `PageLoadTimeStamp` is undefined, the following actions are taken:
     - Using `LBGAnalytics.datalayer.set()`, it initialises:
       - `PageLoadTimeStamp` with the current timestamp.
       - `UtagViewTimeStamp` with the current timestamp.
       - Two functions (`TimeSincePageLoad` and `TimeSinceViewEvent`) which calculate the difference between the current time and the respective stored timestamp. Both functions include a condition to return the time difference only if it is less than 10 minutes (600,000 milliseconds), otherwise they return undefined.
     - It also directly sets these values on `b`:
       - `PageLoadTimeStamp` and `UtagViewTimeStamp` are assigned the current timestamp.
       - `TimeSincePageLoad` and `TimeSinceViewEvent` are initialised to 0.

3. **Handling View Event:**  
   - If `a` equals "view", it implies that a view event is occurring:
     - The code updates the `UtagViewTimeStamp` in the data layer using `LBGAnalytics.datalayer.set()`.  
       The true flag as the second argument likely ensures an immediate override or forced update.
     - Resets `TimeSinceViewEvent` to 0.

4. **Populating Event Variables:**  
   - The code checks if both `TimeSincePageLoad` and `TimeSinceViewEvent` are defined on `b`.
   - If they are, it sets:
     - `b["aa.event601"]` to 1. (This likely acts as an indicator flag that timing events have been captured.)
     - `b["aa.event602"]` to `TimeSincePageLoad` (or 0 if it is undefined).
     - `b["aa.event603"]` to `TimeSinceViewEvent` (or 0 if it is undefined).

### Dependencies

- **Global Object Dependency:**  
  - The code depends on `LBGAnalytics.datalayer` being available globally and having a `set()` method.  
  - `eventType` (a) and `eventPayload` (b) are provided as guaranteed inputs by the Tealium environment.

- **Time Computation:**  
  - The code relies on JavaScript’s `Date` object to compute time differences.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Example Scenario 1: Initial Page Load

1. During the initial page load, the extension checks for the undefined `PageLoadTimeStamp`:
   - `now` is calculated.
   - `PageLoadTimeStamp` and `UtagViewTimeStamp` are both set to `now` using both the `datalayer.set()` and directly on `eventPayload` (b).
   - Timing functions are defined to measure elapsed time for page load and view events.
   - `TimeSincePageLoad` and `TimeSinceViewEvent` are initialised to 0.
   - No "view" event is triggered, so the corresponding if-condition is not executed.

### Example Scenario 2: View Event Trigger

1. A view event is triggered (where `eventType` equals "view"):
   - The code first performs the timestamp initialisation if it hasn’t already been done.
   - Next, because `a == "view"`, it updates `UtagViewTimeStamp` via `LBGAnalytics.datalayer.set()` and then resets `TimeSinceViewEvent` to 0.
   - Finally, it sets:
     - `aa.event601` as a flag (1),
     - `aa.event602` to the computed `TimeSincePageLoad` (elapsed time since the page load timestamp),
     - `aa.event603` to the computed `TimeSinceViewEvent` (which is reset to 0 upon the view event).

### Edge Conditions

- **Exceeding 10 Minutes:**  
  - If the function `TimeSincePageLoad` or `TimeSinceViewEvent` calculates a duration above 10 minutes (600,000 ms), they will return undefined.  
  - In such cases, the extension defaults to 0 when setting `aa.event602` and `aa.event603`.

- **Multiple View Events:**  
  - When multiple view events occur, the `UtagViewTimeStamp` is updated each time, and the elapsed time for `TimeSinceViewEvent` is recalculated, ensuring that the duration is measured from the most recent view event.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Time Limit Constraint:**  
  - The extension only returns valid timing values if the elapsed time is under 10 minutes. If the value exceeds this threshold, it returns undefined. This may affect analytics reporting if user sessions extend beyond 10 minutes.

- **Global Dependency on LBGAnalytics.datalayer:**  
  - The extension depends on the global `LBGAnalytics.datalayer` object. If this object is not present or its `set()` method is altered by other scripts, the extension could fail to update the data layer properly.

- **Simultaneous Extensions:**  
  - Since this extension sets properties directly on the `eventPayload` (b), other extensions or scripts that manipulate the same keys (e.g., `PageLoadTimeStamp`, `UtagViewTimeStamp`, or the `aa.*` keys) could inadvertently overwrite or conflict with these values.

- **No Robust Error Handling:**  
  - The extension assumes that all required inputs and external dependencies are available and valid, which might lead to unexpected issues if any assumptions are violated.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Code Modularity:**  
  - Consider encapsulating the timestamp initialisation and view event handling in separate functions. This will make the code easier to test and maintain.

- **Enhanced Defensive Checks:**  
  - While the availability of `eventType` and `eventPayload` is guaranteed, additional checks for the existence of `LBGAnalytics` and its `datalayer.set()` method could improve robustness (if this is acceptable within the context of the environment).

- **Comments & Code Readability:**  
  - Increase inline documentation to explain the logic for checking the 10-minute constraint and the purpose of each data layer key, aiding future developers in understanding the flow.

- **Separation of Concerns:**  
  - If possible, separate the logic for computing time differences into their own helper functions. This would reduce code duplication and simplify updates or changes in the future.

- **Error Logging:**  
  - Implement basic error logging (using console.error, for instance) to capture unexpected failures related to the dependency on LBGAnalytics.

_Important:_  
The refactoring recommendations adhere to ES5 standards. Avoid using ES6 features such as arrow functions, template literals, let/const declarations, etc.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  - Regularly verify that the global object `LBGAnalytics.datalayer` maintains its required functionality and that no other extensions or scripts conflict with the keys managed by this extension.
  - Document any interactions with other extensions, especially those that may manipulate similar properties on the data layer.

- **Ownership:**  
  - Assign a dedicated team member or team responsible for handling analytics extensions. This specialist should periodically test and review the extension against new platform updates.

- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Include unit tests to simulate both page load and view events, ensuring that the timestamps set correctly and that computed values respect the 10-minute rule.
  - Perform cross-browser testing to ensure that the use of `new Date().getTime()` and other JavaScript functions behave consistently across all supported browsers.

- **Version Control & Deployment:**  
  - Keep the extension code in a central version-controlled repository.
  - Document any changes in a changelog for future reference to track debugging, refactoring efforts, or feature enhancements.

- **Review Dependencies:**  
  - Monitor any updates related to the Tealium iQ platform or LBGAnalytics, as changes in these systems might necessitate adjustments or further testing of this extension.
