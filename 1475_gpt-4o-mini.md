# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: SCEP Search

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name**: SCEP Search
- **Extension ID**: 100040
- **Type**: Advanced JavaScript Code
- **Scope**: DOM Ready
- **Execution Frequency**: Run Once

### Summary
The SCEP Search extension captures user interactions with the search functionality on a specified webpage (i.e., `/search.html`). It listens for clicks on the search button and search close button, sending relevant analytics events to LBGAnalytics. Additionally, it captures and records the search query and number of results displayed when the page is loaded and a search query is present in the URL.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- **`$`**: Represents jQuery, providing convenient methods to manipulate the DOM and listen for events.
- **`results`**: A variable that stores the number of results detected on the page, conditioned by the structure of the search information.

### Logic Flow
1. **Event Listeners**: 
   - The extension sets up click event listeners for:
     - An element with ID `search-click`, which sends an event when the search overlay is opened.
     - A button with class `search-close`, which sends an event when the search overlay is closed.
     - A button with class `search-btn`, which currently has no defined action.
   
2. **Page Load Logic**:
   - Upon loading `/search.html`, if the URL contains a query (indicated by `q=`), the code calculates the number of search results from the `div.search-info` element's children. The search query and the result count are sent to LBGAnalytics as a search event.

### Dependencies
- **jQuery**: This extension relies on jQuery, which should be defined globally as `clova2.$`.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Scenario
- **User Action**: A user clicks on the search button, resulting in the opening of the search overlay.
- **Expected Outcome**: An analytics event `overlay("Search", "form", "open")` is sent with the search location tagged as "SCEP Search".

### Edge Case Scenario
- **User Action**: The user navigates to `/search.html?q=example` with only one search result visible.
- **Expected Outcome**: The extension extracts the query (`example`) and sends an event recording the search with `results` being `1`.

### No Query Provided
- **User Action**: Visiting `/search.html` without a query parameter.
- **Expected Outcome**: No search event is sent, and the extension gracefully handles this by not executing the search logic.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Event Listener on `search-btn`**: The click event on the search button is set up but lacks functionality. This may lead to confusion or missed analytics.
- **Search Results Calculation**: The logic extracts the number of results based on hard-coded indices (`b:nth(3)`). If the HTML structure changes or is inconsistent, this may lead to incorrect results being sent to analytics.
- **Fail-Silently Handling**: All `try-catch` blocks are set to fail silently, which may make debugging difficult if an error does occur.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Implement Functionality for `search-btn`**: Add meaningful interaction logic for the `search-btn`.
- **Modularisation**: Break down the code into smaller, reusable functions that can handle specific tasks (e.g., sending analytics events).
- **Improve Error Logging**: Replace silent fails with logging to the console or a designated error handling mechanism to aid in troubleshooting.
- **Dynamic Result Handling**: Instead of using hard-coded indices for results, consider a more robust way to determine the results based on the content dynamically.
- **Code Style**: Maintain consistent commenting practices, ideally explaining the purpose of more complex logic, to enhance readability.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ownership**: Assign a specific team member to oversee the extension and ensure it is updated with changes in code functionalities or analytics requirements.
- **Testing Guidelines**: Conduct regular testing, especially after updates to the search overlay or the page's HTML structure. Tests should verify that analytics events are sent correctly and that edge cases are handled gracefully.
- **Documentation Maintenance**: Keep this documentation updated with any changes made to the code. Consider version control practices to track changes in the extension's functionality.
