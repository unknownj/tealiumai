# SCEP Search Extension Documentation

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name**: SCEP Search  
- **ID**: 1475 (with extensionId: 100040)  
- **Type**: Advanced Javascript Code  
- **Scope**: DOM Ready  
- **Execution Frequency**: Run Once  

**Summary**:  
The SCEP Search extension is designed to capture user interactions with a search overlay and log specific events via the LBGAnalytics tracking system. It listens for clicks on various UI elements (e.g. search open, search close buttons) to trigger analytic events, and it also processes search results on a dedicated search page. This facilitates monitoring user engagement with the search functionality and helps track the flow of search-related data.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables & Objects
- **$ (jQuery)**: The code uses the jQuery library, referenced via the global variable passed in as `window.clova2.$`.
- **LBGAnalytics**: A global object used to handle analytics events. Its properties, such as `events.overlay` and `events.search`, are invoked to record user actions.
  
### Logic Flow & Code Structure
1. **Document Event Binding**:  
   - The code is wrapped inside an immediate function that is invoked with the jQuery instance.  
   - Listeners are attached to handle clicks on elements:
     - `#search-click`: When the element with this ID is clicked, the code logs an event indicating the search overlay has been opened.
     - `button.search-close`: When the close button is clicked, an event is logged with the overlay closing action.
     - `button.search-btn`: A click handler is declared for a button with the class `search-btn`; however, no action is currently defined inside this handler.
    
2. **Search Page Handling**:  
   - The code checks if the current pathname is `/search.html` and if there is a query parameter `q=` in the URL.
   - If the conditions are met, it attempts to extract the search term from the URL.  
   - It also attempts to compute the number of search results by checking the number of `<b>` elements within a `div.search-info`:
     - If three `<b>` elements are present, it extracts the text from the third one.
     - If four `<b>` elements are present, it follows the same logic, extracting the text from the third one.
   - An analytics event is then triggered using `LBGAnalytics.events.search`, passing the decoded search query, a hard-coded search type ("Text"), the search location ("SCEP Search"), and the computed results count.

### Processing Details & Dependencies
- **Event Triggering with LBGAnalytics**:  
  - For overlay events:  
    - When the search is opened: `.overlay("Search", "form", "open").genericEvent(79).send({SearchLocation: "SCEP Search"})`
    - When the search is closed: `.overlay("Search", "form", "close")`
  - For search events on the search page:  
    - The event is sent after computing the search term and results count: `.search(...)`
- **Error Handling**:  
  - The code utilises try/catch blocks around each event trigger to silently handle any errors that may occur without crashing the rest of the script.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Usage Examples

### Example 1: User Opens the Search Overlay
- **Action**: A user clicks the element with the ID `search-click`.
- **Outcome**:  
  - The event handler captures this click.
  - An overlay "open" event is generated via LBGAnalytics.
  - The event payload includes `SearchLocation: "SCEP Search"`.

### Example 2: User Closes the Search Overlay
- **Action**: A user clicks the button with the class `search-close`.
- **Outcome**:  
  - The event handler detects the click.
  - An overlay "close" event is reported using LBGAnalytics.
  
### Example 3: User Searches on the Search Page
- **Action**:  
  - The user navigates to `/search.html?q=example` where "example" is the search term.
  - The code checks for the query parameter in the URL.
- **Outcome**:  
  - The search query is decoded.
  - The search results count is extracted from the `div.search-info` element.
  - A search event is sent using LBGAnalytics with the search term, a hard-coded search type ("Text"), the location ("SCEP Search"), and the results count.
  
### Edge Case: Missing or Altered DOM Elements
- **Scenario**:  
  - If the expected DOM elements (e.g. `div.search-info b`) are not present or the structure changes.
- **Outcome**:  
  - The code may not extract an accurate results count.
  - However, due to the try/catch blocks, errors are silently caught, and the extension fails gracefully without breaking other functionalities.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **DOM Dependencies**:  
  - The extraction logic for the search results count is based on a fixed structure (expecting 3 or 4 `<b>` elements). Changes to the DOM structure may break this extraction logic.
  
- **Silent Error Handling**:  
  - Errors in analytics event execution are silently caught. While this avoids script crashes, it may hide valuable issues that would be useful for debugging.

- **Undefined Behaviour for Search Button**:  
  - The event handler attached to `button.search-btn` is empty, which might be a placeholder. Its lack of functionality could be misleading if intended functionality is not added later.

- **Global Object Dependency**:  
  - The code relies on `LBGAnalytics` being present globally. If this object is not available or changes its API, the extension will not work as expected.

- **Potential Conflicts**:  
  - Other Tealium extensions or external scripts that attach similar event handlers to the same elements might conflict with this extension.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks & Robustness**:  
  - Consider adding validations to ensure that necessary DOM elements (e.g. `div.search-info`) exist before attempting to access them.
  - It might be useful to provide logging (temporarily or conditionally) for errors rather than completely silencing them.

- **Code Modularity & Comments**:  
  - Break the code into modular functions (within the confines of ES5) to isolate event bindings, search result processing, and error handling.
  - Add inline comments explaining the purpose of each section to improve readability for future maintainers.

- **Handler for Empty button.search-btn**:  
  - If this section is intended for future functionality, consider adding a comment indicating that it is a placeholder for additional logic.

- **Consistency in Element Selection**:  
  - Ensure that the element selection for search results is robust (e.g. using more explicit selectors or data attributes to avoid dependency on element order).

- **Documentation of Error Cases**:  
  - Instead of letting errors fail silently, implementing a debug mode (configurable via an extension property) that logs errors could be beneficial during testing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance**:  
  - Regularly verify the integration with the LBGAnalytics global object, especially after any updates or changes in the analytics library.
  - Monitor any changes to the website’s DOM structure that might necessitate updates to the search results extraction logic.

- **Ownership & Testing Guidelines**:  
  - Assign clear ownership for the extension functionality to ensure that any changes in related business logic are aligned with analytics requirements.
  - Implement regression tests to cover key user interactions (e.g. clicking search open/close, navigation to search page with query parameters) using a test framework compatible with ES5.
  - Maintain version control and clear commit messages when changes are made to this extension.

- **Future Considerations**:  
  - Keep track of any external dependencies that could alter the expected outcomes (for instance, external scripts modifying the DOM structure).
  - Document any changes in dependency versions and the expected data payloads from the analytics events for future reference.

This documentation should be shared with all developers and stakeholders to ensure a common understanding of the extension’s purpose, functioning, and future enhancement guidelines.
