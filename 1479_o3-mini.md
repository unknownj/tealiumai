# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: Spending Rewards Correlations

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Tealium iQ extension "Spending Rewards Correlations", explaining its purpose, code flow, usage examples, known limitations, recommendations for refactoring, and maintenance considerations.

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Spending Rewards Correlations  
- **Extension ID:** 1479 (Internal ID) / 100040 (Tealium extensionId)  
- **Type:** Advanced Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** DOM Ready  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Once  

**Summary:**  
This extension is designed to run on pages where the pathname includes either "sr_hub" or "spending_rewards_hub". It waits 3 seconds after the DOM is ready before executing its core logic. The extension locates specific content sections via jQuery selectors, extracts offer details (such as an offer identifier, merchant name, percentage, and expiry date), modifies the data (e.g. replaces "/" with a space), and then passes this information to LBGAnalytics using a defined correlations API. This process is used to track spending rewards offers on the page, correlate data with provided campaign/event IDs, and facilitate analytics through the LBGAnalytics platform.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables & Dependencies

- **window.location.pathname:**  
  Checks the current URL to determine if the code should run based on substring matches for "sr_hub" or "spending_rewards_hub".

- **setTimeout (3000 ms):**  
  Delays execution by 3 seconds to ensure that the DOM elements of interest have loaded before attempting to access them.

- **var $ = window.clova2.$:**  
  Assigns the jQuery object provided by a global object (`clova2`) to variable `$`.  
  **Dependency:** Relies on the existence of `window.clova2.$` to perform DOM querying and manipulation.

- **var offers:**  
  Uses jQuery to select DOM elements matching the CSS selector ".sn-sr-content-accordions > div > div.sn-accordion".  
  **Purpose:** Retrieves an array of elements that represent individual offers on the page.

### Logic Flow

1. **Pathname Validation:**  
   The code first checks if the current page URL contains either "sr_hub" or "spending_rewards_hub". If not, the code does not execute the remaining logic.

2. **Delayed Execution:**  
   A `setTimeout` ensures the code block runs after a 3000 ms delay, allowing time for the offer elements to be rendered in the DOM.

3. **Offer Collection:**  
   - The code uses jQuery to select offer elements within ".sn-sr-content-accordions".
   - Each offer element is processed by:
     - Finding a button with an id and class `sn-accordion-title-button` to extract the offer identifier.
     - Extracting and trimming the text for the merchant name, percentage, and expiry date from their respective elements.
     - The expiry date string is further manipulated by removing the "Expires:" label and trimming excess whitespace.

4. **Data Transformation:**  
   - Each piece of extracted data undergoes a transformation where any "/" characters are replaced with spaces.
   - The transformed pieces are then joined together using "/" as a separator to form a single string representing the complete offer.

5. **Analytics Correlation:**  
   - For each offer string created, the extension calls `LBGAnalytics.correlations.add` with a correlation object (the key "SpendingRewardsOffer" paired with the offer string) and a tracking event or campaign id represented by an array containing the number 71.

### Dependencies on Global Objects/Libraries

- **window.clova2.$:**  
  The code assumes that an instance of jQuery is available at this location. If `window.clova2.$` is not defined, the extension will fail to correctly query the DOM.

- **LBGAnalytics:**  
  Relies on the global object `LBGAnalytics` and specifically its `correlations.add` method to process the collected data. If this object or its method is not available, analytics data will not be recorded.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Scenario

- **Page URL:** "https://example.com/spending_rewards_hub/somepage"
- **DOM Structure:**  
  The page contains multiple `.sn-accordion` elements each containing:
  - A button element with an id and class `sn-accordion-title-button`.
  - Merchant name in `.sn-sr-accordion-title-merchantName`
  - Percentage in `.sn-sr-accordion-title-percentage`
  - Expiry date in `.sn-sr-accordion-title-expiry-date` formatted as "Expires: DD/MM/YYYY".
  
- **Process:**  
  The code waits 3 seconds, queries the DOM, constructs strings by joining the extracted data (after replacing "/" with spaces within each data element), and then calls:
  
    LBGAnalytics.correlations.add({SpendingRewardsOffer: "id/merchantName/percentage/expiryDate"}, [71]);
  
  Each offer is processed individually.

### Edge Conditions

- **Missing DOM Elements:**  
  If one of the expected DOM elements is absent (e.g. missing `.sn-sr-accordion-title-percentage`), the `.text()` call might return an empty string. Since no defensive checks are in place for empty values, the resulting string may have missing data segments but will still be processed.

- **Unexpected Text Formats:**  
  If the expiry date does not contain "Expires:" or the expected date format, the split and trim operations might result in unexpected output, potentially leading to inconsistencies in analytics data.

- **Unavailable Dependencies:**  
  - If `window.clova2.$` is not present, the jQuery-based DOM queries fail completely.
  - If `LBGAnalytics` is not correctly defined in the global scope, analytics events will not be recorded.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Dependency on Global Objects:**  
  The extension is reliant on `window.clova2.$` for jQuery operations and on `LBGAnalytics` for tracking data. In environments where these globals are not available or have been redefined, the extension may fail.

- **Hard-coded Delay:**  
  The use of a fixed 3000 ms delay may not be sufficient if the page takes longer to load the required DOM elements, or it may be longer than necessary if the elements are loaded quickly, potentially delaying analytics tracking.

- **No Error Handling:**  
  The code does not include any try/catch blocks or error handling logic. Unforeseen errors (e.g. undefined properties) could result in silent failures.

- **Assumptions about DOM Structure:**  
  The code assumes a specific DOM hierarchy and class structure. Changes to the structure (for instance, updates in design or markup by UX teams) would require corresponding updates in the selectors used in this extension.

- **Potential Conflicts:**  
  If other extensions or scripts manipulate the same DOM elements or overwrite global objects (`LBGAnalytics` or `window.clova2.$`), conflicts might occur in tracking data or DOM manipulations.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks:**  
  - Although defensive coding for `eventType` and `eventPayload` is not required, it is advisable to validate that `window.clova2` and `LBGAnalytics` are defined before proceeding.
  - Consider verifying that the DOM elements exist before attempting to access their results.

- **Modularisation:**  
  - Encapsulate the code in a function to reduce global scope pollution.
  - Separate the data extraction logic from the analytics call. This could be achieved by writing helper functions to process the DOM elements and format the output string.

- **Delay Management:**  
  - Instead of a fixed delay, consider using event listeners or checking periodically (polling) if the DOM elements have loaded; however, ensure that the solution remains within ES5 boundaries.

- **Code Comments:**  
  - Enhance inline documentation (comments) to explain key steps, making future maintenance easier.

- **Error Logging:**  
  - Introduce logging (using console.error or similar) to assist in debugging if certain elements cannot be found or if the analytics call fails.

- **Maintain ES5 Compliance:**  
  - Avoid ES2015 features. Continue using functions, var keyword, and string concatenation as present in the current version.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  - Regularly review the extension if there are updates to the page structure.  
  - Ensure that dependencies (`clova2` for jQuery and `LBGAnalytics`) remain intact with any system updates.

- **Ownership:**  
  - Designate a developer or team responsible for tracking pages where this extension is active.  
  - Maintain a changelog for any modifications to the extension code.

- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Test in multiple scenarios including pages that both include and omit the expected DOM elements.  
  - Validate analytics data is being correctly recorded via LBGAnalytics.  
  - Use browser developer tools to monitor console for any errors during the extension execution.

- **Documentation Updates:**  
  - Keep this documentation up-to-date with any changes to the corresponding backend or front-end analytics requirements.  
  - Communicate any modifications to stakeholders to ensure proper usage and understanding.
