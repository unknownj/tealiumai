# Change Cookie variables to Booleans for Celebrus

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Change Cookie variables to Booleans for Celebrus  
- **ID:** 1483  
- **Extension ID:** 100040  
- **Type:** Advanced Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** 1222  
- **Execution Frequency:** Runs during the Tealium tag processing flow (per event load)

**Summary:**  
This extension is designed to update the mapping of several data elements (such as Brand, Division, JourneyAction, etc.) to specific variables used for Celebrus reporting purposes. In addition, it forces the cookie targeting variables (CookiesTargeting and CookiesPerformance) on the browser object (b) to be strictly Boolean values (true or false). This conversion helps to ensure that subsequent processing does not have to deal with unexpected data types.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables:
- **mapping:**  
  An object containing a list of key/value pairs that defines the mapping between standard data element names (e.g. "Brand", "JourneyAction") and their Celebrus counterparts (e.g. "lbg_brand", "lbg_journeyaction"). The mapping is used to set keys in the u.map object.

- **u:**  
  A global object representing the tag configuration. The extension adds mappings to u.map and also adds the CelebrusLeadData mapping.

- **b:**  
  A global object representing the event payload. Here, it is used to access and modify cookie targeting variables.

- **eventType, eventPayload, tagObject:**  
  Aliases for function parameters:  
  • a corresponds to eventType  
  • b corresponds to eventPayload  
  • u corresponds to tagObject  

### Logic Flow:
1. **Mapping Setup:**  
   A static mapping object is defined. The mapping pairs properties like "Brand" with their corresponding Celebrus variables like "lbg_brand".

2. **Mapping Application:**  
   A for-in loop iterates over the mapping object keys. For each key, the value is assigned to the u.map property of the same key. This ensures that data elements received in Tealium are translated to their respective Celebrus variable names.

3. **Additional Mapping:**  
   Outside of the loop, a specific mapping "CelebrusLeadData" is explicitly set to map to "Responses".

4. **Cookie Boolean Conversion:**  
   The extension then converts properties on the b (eventPayload) object:
   - CookiesTargeting is converted to a Boolean using the double negation operator (!!).
   - CookiesPerformance is also converted to a Boolean in the same way.
   This enforces the data type and prevents possible issues caused by non-Boolean values.

### Dependencies:
- The extension makes use of global objects u (tagObject) and b (eventPayload), which are standard in the Tealium environment.  
- No external libraries are utilised.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Standard Data Element Mapping
When an event is triggered:
- The tagObject (u) already has an empty or predefined map.
- The extension populates u.map with a mapping such that:
  - u.map.Brand = "lbg_brand"
  - u.map.Division = "lbg_division"
  - … and so on for each defined mapping.
- Additionally, u.map.CelebrusLeadData is set to "Responses".
  
This allows downstream processes to lookup the correct Celebrus variable names using the keys provided in the extension.

### Scenario 2: Cookie Boolean Conversion
For an incoming event:
- If eventPayload (b) has CookiesTargeting with a value of "true" (as a string) or any truthy value, the conversion (!!) ensures that b.CookiesTargeting becomes the Boolean true.
- If b.CookiesPerformance is undefined or falsy, it is explicitly set to false.
  
This standardises the cookie variables to Boolean values. No unexpected type conversions occur in later processing.

### Edge Condition:
- If any of the properties on eventPayload are not present or are already Boolean, the double negation conversion ( !! ) will ensure consistency without redundant processing or errors.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Dependency on Global Objects:**  
  The extension assumes that the objects (u and b) are available in the global context. If these objects are not defined (which is unlikely in a standard Tealium environment), the code would fail.

- **Hardcoded Mappings:**  
  The mapping object is statically defined. Changes in Celebrus requirements may necessitate updating this mapping manually within the extension.

- **No Error Handling:**  
  The script lacks defensive coding—for instance, it does not validate if u.map or the cookie properties exist before assignment. This is acceptable given the guaranteed environment but should be monitored if the environment changes.

- **Extension Conflicts:**  
  If another extension modifies u.map or eventPayload properties for cookie variables, there could be a conflict. It is recommended to review processing order in Tealium iQ to ensure compatibility.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks:**  
  Although the environment guarantees the existence of eventType, eventPayload, etc., consider adding minimal checks or comments for future maintainers who may reuse similar patterns in a different context.

- **Code Comments and Readability:**  
  Increase inline documentation for each logical block. For example, annotate the mapping loop and cookie conversion steps to provide clearer context to future developers.

- **Modularisation:**  
  Consider breaking the mapping and cookie conversion into separate, well-documented functions. This can improve readability and make unit testing easier, even within ES5 constraints.

- **Avoid Hardcoding If Possible:**  
  In cases where the mapping between data elements and Celebrus variable names may change over time, consider externalising the mapping data or parameterising it through a configuration object.

- **Use Consistent Naming Conventions:**  
  Review and possibly standardise variable naming (e.g., usage of lowerCamelCase or other consistent patterns) consistently across Tealium extensions.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  A designated maintainer should monitor both CES (Celebrus) requirements and Tealium upgrades to ensure that the mappings remain in sync with external systems. Any update in Celebrus naming conventions should be promptly reflected in this extension.

- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Perform unit tests in a controlled Tealium test environment.  
  - Validate that u.map contains all required mappings after execution.
  - Confirm that the cookie targeting values are correctly converted to Booleans.
  - Consider automated testing scripts that trigger different eventPayload scenarios (including edge cases where certain expected properties are missing).

- **Ownership:**  
  Document the contact details or team responsible for the maintenance of the extension in the project repository’s README or corresponding maintenance document.

- **Further Enhancements:**  
  Future improvements might include logging or error reporting when unexpected data is encountered. This may help troubleshoot issues in environments with external modifications.
