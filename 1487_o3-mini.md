## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Compound Journey Analytics Props  
- **ID:** 1487 (Internal), Extension ID: 100040  
- **Type:** Advanced Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** 928  
- **Execution Frequency:**  
  - The extension is executed on every event that meets the (currently empty) conditions.  
  - In practice, the logic inside the extension only executes if the event payload (variable b) contains a truthy value for `JourneyName`.

**Summary:**  
This extension constructs composite analytic property strings by combining multiple event data properties. It creates three distinct composite strings (JourneyAnalytics1, JourneyAnalytics2, and JourneyAnalytics3) by concatenating specific journey and event properties, standardising them (including converting to lowercase and removing semicolons), and then assigning the results to both Adobe Analytics props (s.prop21, s.prop22, s.prop23) and a mapping object (`u.map`). This mechanism simplifies the creation of compound reporting metrics for journey and event analytics.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables and Objects

- **a:** Represents the event type (guaranteed to be present as a string).  
- **b:** Represents the event payload object which holds various journey and event data.  
- **u:** Represents the tag object; its `map` property is used to associate the computed analytics string properties with Adobe Analytics props.  
- **s:** Global object (assumed to be present) used to report analytics properties, such as `s.prop21`, `s.prop22`, and `s.prop23`.

### Logic Flow

1. **Initial Check:**  
   - The extension first checks if `b.JourneyName` is present. If not, none of the subsequent analytics properties are computed or assigned.

2. **Composite String Construction:**  
   - **JourneyAnalytics1:**  
     - Uses an array composed of `b.JourneyName`, `b.JourneyStepName` (defaults to "None" if undefined), and `b.ApplicationState` (defaults to "None" if undefined).  
     - Each element is coerced to a string, split on semicolons (removing them), and converted to lowercase.  
     - The resulting segments are concatenated using a period (`.`) as a separator.
     
   - **JourneyAnalytics2:**  
     - Uses an array composed of `b.JourneyAction` (defaults to "None") and `b.JourneyActionNarrative` (defaults to "None").  
     - Each element is similarly processed: string coercion, semicolon removal, and lowercasing, then concatenated with a period.
     
   - **JourneyAnalytics3:**  
     - Uses an array composed of `b.JourneyEvent` (defaults to "None"), `b.EventAction` (defaults to "None"), and `b.EventNarrative` (defaults to "None").  
     - Follows the same transformation process and joins the parts with a period.

3. **Assignment to Analytics Properties:**  
   - The computed composite strings are assigned to global analytics properties:
     - `s.prop21` is set to `JourneyAnalytics1`.
     - `s.prop22` is set to `JourneyAnalytics2`.
     - `s.prop23` is set to `JourneyAnalytics3`.
     
   - Additionally, the mapping object (`u.map`) is updated so that:
     - `"JourneyAnalytics1"` is mapped to `"prop21"`.
     - `"JourneyAnalytics2"` is mapped to `"prop22"`.
     - `"JourneyAnalytics3"` is mapped to `"prop23"`.

### Dependencies on Global Objects or Libraries

- **Global Variables:**  
  - `s`: Used for assigning Adobe Analytics properties.
  - `b`: The event payload object containing the necessary journey and event properties.
  
- **Assumptions:**  
  - The extension relies on the existence and proper structure of the `b` object, the Adobe Analytics object `s`, and the `u.map` property in the tag object.
  
- **Note:**  
  - The code assumes that `eventType`, `eventPayload`, and `tagObject` (passed as `a`, `b`, and `u` respectively) are always present and correctly formatted.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Example 1: Normal Operation

**Input Payload (b):**
- JourneyName: "Checkout Process"
- JourneyStepName: "Payment Information"
- ApplicationState: "Active"
- JourneyAction: "Button Click"
- JourneyActionNarrative: "Proceed to Payment"
- JourneyEvent: "Form Submission"
- EventAction: "Submit"
- EventNarrative: "Payment Form Completed"

**Processing:**
- *JourneyAnalytics1*:  
  - Array: ["Checkout Process", "Payment Information", "Active"]  
  - After processing: "checkout process.payment information.active"
  
- *JourneyAnalytics2*:  
  - Array: ["Button Click", "Proceed to Payment"]  
  - After processing: "button click.proceed to payment"
  
- *JourneyAnalytics3*:  
  - Array: ["Form Submission", "Submit", "Payment Form Completed"]  
  - After processing: "form submission.submit.payment form completed"

**Outcome:**
- `s.prop21` becomes "checkout process.payment information.active"  
- `s.prop22` becomes "button click.proceed to payment"  
- `s.prop23` becomes "form submission.submit.payment form completed"  
- `u.map` is updated accordingly.

### Example 2: Missing Optional Fields

**Input Payload (b):**
- JourneyName: "User Registration"
- JourneyStepName: undefined (or not provided)
- ApplicationState: undefined (or not provided)
- JourneyAction: undefined (or not provided)
- JourneyActionNarrative: "Started Registration"
- JourneyEvent: undefined (or not provided)
- EventAction: undefined (or not provided)
- EventNarrative: undefined (or not provided)

**Processing:**
- *JourneyAnalytics1*:  
  - Array: ["User Registration", "None", "None"]  
  - Result: "user registration.none.none"
  
- *JourneyAnalytics2*:  
  - Array: ["None", "Started Registration"]  
  - Result: "none.started registration"
  
- *JourneyAnalytics3*:  
  - Array: ["None", "None", "None"]  
  - Result: "none.none.none"

**Outcome:**  
- `s.prop21` is "user registration.none.none"  
- `s.prop22` is "none.started registration"  
- `s.prop23` is "none.none.none"

### Example 3: Handling Semicolon in Data

**Input Payload (b):**
- JourneyName: "Sales;Promotion"
- JourneyStepName: "Landing;Page"
- ApplicationState: "Active"

**Processing (for JourneyAnalytics1):**
- Array initially: ["Sales;Promotion", "Landing;Page", "Active"]  
- Each string is processed to remove semicolons, resulting in: "salespromotion.landingpage.active"

**Outcome:**
- `s.prop21` becomes "salespromotion.landingpage.active"

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Reliance on Specific Field Names:**  
  - The extension depends on the presence and naming of fields within the event payload (`b`). If these field names change or are misspelt in incoming events, the extension will silently fail to compute the analytics properties.
  
- **Single Conditional Check:**  
  - The composite strings are only built if `b.JourneyName` exists. If this property is missing or empty, none of the analytics props are generated.
  
- **String Replacement Approach:**  
  - The use of multiple `map` functions for string cleaning (especially the removal of semicolons) is repetitive. There is a potential risk if additional special characters or delimiters need to be managed in future requirements.
  
- **Global Namespace Pollution:**  
  - The extension writes directly to global objects (`s` and `u.map`) which can lead to conflicts with other extensions if similar property names are used concurrently.
  
- **No Error Logging:**  
  - There are no logging or error handling mechanisms in place, which may complicate debugging if the data is not processed as expected.

---

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Code Modularisation:**  
  - Extract the repeated logic (such as conversion to string, removal of semicolons, and lowercasing) into a standalone helper function. This would reduce repetition and improve readability.
  
- **Defensive Checks on Field Values:**  
  - Even though `eventType` and `eventPayload` are guaranteed to be present, consider adding similar validation for other properties if application requirements change.
  
- **Consistent Data Cleaning:**  
  - Consolidate the two `.map` calls that remove semicolons into a single operation to avoid redundancy.
  
- **Documentation & In-Line Comments:**  
  - Enhance the code with in-line comments describing the purpose of each processing step, which will help future developers understand the business logic.
  
- **Maintain ES5 Compliance:**  
  - Continue using ES5 syntax (avoid ES6 constructs such as arrow functions, let/const, template literals, etc.) to ensure compatibility with environments that require legacy support.
  
- **Optional Use of "use strict":**  
  - Consider adding `"use strict";` at the beginning of the function scope to enforce stricter parsing and error handling, ensuring variables are declared and used correctly.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Testing:**  
  - Regularly test the extension with a variety of payloads to ensure that data transformations remain correct after any code or dependency changes.
  - Consider unit tests to cover typical as well as edge cases (e.g., missing values, unexpected characters, etc.).

- **Ownership and Review:**  
  - Assign a designated owner for the extension to ensure that any issues or required changes are addressed promptly.
  - Schedule periodic code reviews to check compatibility with other Tealium iQ extensions and ensure adherence to coding best practices.

- **Change Log:**  
  - Maintain a separate change log document to record updates to the extension. This will aid in debugging and tracking the evolution of the code.

- **Integration Documentation:**  
  - Update internal documentation to reflect how this extension interacts with other parts of the analytics setup (e.g., mapping fields to Adobe Analytics props).

- **Future Enhancements:**  
  - Consider implementing additional validation, logging, or error-handling mechanisms should debugging become necessary.
  - Any changes that may require ES6 features should be evaluated against the requirement to support ES5 environments.
