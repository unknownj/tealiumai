# GA360 : Set VirtualPathName Extension Documentation

This document provides a detailed overview and guide to the “GA360 : Set VirtualPathName” Tealium iQ extension.

---

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** GA360 : Set VirtualPathName  
- **ID:** 1490  
- **Extension ID:** 100040  
- **Type:** Advanced Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** Before Load Rules  
- **Occurrence / Execution Frequency:** Run Always  

**Summary:**  
This extension processes information from the data layer (typically contained within the event payload) in order to generate:
- A virtual URL path (VirtualPathName) suitable for GA360 tracking.
- A corresponding event title (GA4VirtualEventTitle) intended for GA4 event reporting.

The virtual URL is constructed based on several data layer variables such as ProductGroup, ProductSubGroup, PageRole, ApplicationState, JourneyStep, and more. As part of the process, the extension cleans and normalises values (for example, removing spaces, converting to lower case, or handling specific value patterns) and provides different virtual URL generation versions depending on the data available. Debug logs are also output in development (dev) environments.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables  
- **dl:** The data layer object (passed in as eventPayload “b” within the IIFE).  
- **v:** Temporary variable holding the virtual URL segments as an array.  
- **a:** A string of the lowercase alphabet; used to check numerical indexes (e.g. for identifying a journey step using indexOf on character values).  
- **prod, prodsub, jproduct, pagerole, appstate, prodfam, jname, jstep, jstepname:** Variables capturing different aspects of the user’s journey or page context.  
- **hashAfterBang, hashSlashArray, hashSlashPenultimate, hashSlashLast:** Variables created by splitting the “hash” property on ‘!’ and ‘/’ to capture additional URL fragments.

### Logic Flow  
1. **Data Extraction:**  
   - The function `buildVirtualURL(dl)` first extracts needed variables from the data layer.
   - It splits a hash value to get various URL segments (after the ‘!’ and using ‘/’ as a delimiter).

2. **Data Normalisation/Clean-up:**  
   - For `ProductGroup` and related variables, different conditions are checked to normalise the values (e.g. replacing “Fixed Saver 2 Year” with “savings”, lower-casing, and space removal).
   - Special handling is provided for product types like current accounts or specific journey values.
   - If certain variables are undefined, fallbacks are applied. For example, if `prod` is not set but `prodfam` exists, then `prod` adopts the product family value.

3. **Virtual URL Formation:**  
   - Constructs a virtual URL array (`v`) based on:
     - Whether a valid `journey step name` exists.
     - Different product groups (credit cards, current accounts, mortgages, insurance, savings vs. personal lending or loans).
     - Special cases (such as “Forgotten Logon Details”) where the path structure changes.
   - Depending on the condition met, the code assigns a descriptive method name to `dl.GA360VirtualPathNameMethod` with a message indicating which version (or rule set) was applied.
   - The final virtual URL string is built by prepending a "/" and joining array elements with "/" after converting to lowercase and replacing spaces/hyphens appropriately.

4. **GA4 Virtual Event Title Generation:**  
   - The virtual URL is also split into segments, and duplicate segments are removed using a `Set` (with the uniqueness based on exact string match).
   - The segments are then rejoined using " | " as a separator (with minor clean-up) to form a title string saved as `dl.GA4VirtualEventTitle`.

5. **Debug Logging:**  
   - In a development environment (if `dl["ut.env"]` is `"dev"`), key variable values and outputs are logged to the console for verification.

### Dependencies  
- The extension depends on the existence of a data layer object with the expected properties.  
- There is an assumption that the `eventType` (as “a”) and `eventPayload` (as “b”) are available globally and correctly formatted.  
- The code utilises standard ES5 JavaScript constructs ensuring compatibility with older browsers such as IE and Safari.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Example 1: Standard Virtual URL Generation  
**Scenario:**  
- Data layer values include a recognised product group string, a journey step name, and a valid page role/application state.  
- In this case, the extension will create a virtual URL based on version 1 or version 3 logic (depending on whether the product group matches credit cards/current accounts, etc.).  

**Data Layer Example:**  
```
{
  "ProductGroup": "bank savings",
  "ProductSubGroup": "",
  "JourneyProduct": "",
  "PageRole": "login",
  "ApplicationState": "authenticated",
  "JourneyStepName": "EnterUserDetails",
  "hash": "example!123/456"
}
```

**Expected Outcome:**  
- A virtual path such as:  
  "/login/authenticated/savings/EnterUserDetails"  
- A GA360 VirtualPathName method description detailing the version used.  
- A GA4VirtualEventTitle formed from unique path segments, formatted with a " | " separator.

### Example 2: Edge Condition with Missing Step Data  
**Scenario:**  
- If `JourneyStepName` is not available, the code falls back to using `JourneyStep` or the index from the hash values.  
- The extension constructs a less detailed virtual path accordingly (using version 2).  

**Data Layer Example:**  
```
{
  "PageRole": "servicing",
  "ApplicationState": "pending",
  "ProductGroup": "mortgages",
  "hash": "example!789/overview"
}
```

**Expected Outcome:**  
- A fallback virtual path such as:  
  "/servicing/pending/mortgages"  
- The GA360VirtualPathNameMethod indicates the use of version 2 (“no step data”).  
- The GA4VirtualEventTitle is built from the derived unique values of the path excluding any duplicates.

### Example 3: Special Handling for “Forgotten Logon Details”  
**Scenario:**  
- If the journey step name equals “Forgotten Logon Details”, a specific alternative path (version 3) is used.  

**Data Layer Example:**  
```
{
  "PageRole": "servicing",
  "ApplicationState": "recovery",
  "ProductGroup": "insurance",
  "JourneyName": "PasswordRecovery",
  "JourneyStepName": "Forgotten Logon Details",
  "hash": "example!recovery/step"
}
```

**Expected Outcome:**  
- A virtual URL such as:  
  "/servicing/PasswordRecovery/Forgotten Logon Details"  
- Method description set to “VirtualPathName version 3 - forgotten details” with the details logged.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Data Layer Dependency:**  
  The extension requires that specific data layer properties (e.g. ProductGroup, JourneyStepName, hash, etc.) are correctly defined. Unexpected or missing values can lead to fallback behaviour that may not capture the intended virtual URL.

- **Regular Expression and Matching Limitations:**  
  The code uses string matching (case insensitive checks, numeric index using a string of alphabets) that could lead to false positives if data contains unexpected patterns.

- **Edge Conditions with Hash Values:**  
  The approach to extract `hashAfterBang`, `hashSlashArray`, and particularly `hashSlashPenultimate` may fail if the hash string does not include the expected delimiters. Special attention is needed for unconventional hash values.

- **Browser Compatibility:**  
  While the extension is written in ES5 for wide compatibility, the use of newer methods such as `Array.from` might require a polyfill in older environments.

- **Extension Conflicts:**  
  If there are other Tealium extensions that modify the same data layer variables (`VirtualPathName`, `GA360VirtualPathNameMethod`, or `GA4VirtualEventTitle`), there is a risk of conflict or overwriting values.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Modularisation:**  
  Consider refactoring the code into smaller, reusable functions to isolate the data normalisation, URL segment assembly, and final virtual path creation. This may improve readability and maintainability.

- **Defensive Checks:**  
  While defensive coding for the presence of eventType and eventPayload is not required, additional checks on properties such as `hash` (e.g. verifying that it contains the “!” character) could help avoid runtime errors in unexpected cases.

- **Code Style & Readability:**  
  - Continue using descriptive variable names and comment blocks.  
  - Ensure consistent code indentation and spacing.
  - Use clear separation within conditional blocks to indicate the different versions used for virtual URL generation.

- **Use of Polyfills:**  
  Since ES5 support is required, consider including a polyfill for `Array.from` to ensure compatibility with older browsers like IE.

- **Testing:**  
  Set up unit tests (perhaps engaging a lightweight test framework) for each logical branch (version 1, version 1a, 1b, 1c, version 2, version 3, etc.) to ensure any logic changes can be quickly verified in both standard and edge cases.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ownership & Documentation:**  
  Clearly document any further changes to the data layer structure or the requirements from GA360/GA4 tracking. Consider embedding version numbers and update logs within the code comments (as already partially done with “v1.11.0”).

- **Logging in Production vs. Development:**  
  Maintain the development logging (`console.log`) gated behind the ‘ut.env === "dev"’ condition to help with future debugging without polluting production logs.

- **Future Enhancements:**  
  - Continually review the conditions for building the virtual URL as platform requirements evolve.
  - Look for opportunities to further modularise the code to enable more granular testing.

- **Review & Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Test the extension in multiple browsers (especially if older browsers are in use) to verify ES5 compatibility.
  - Establish a set of data layer examples that mimics various user journeys for regression testing after each change.

- **Version Control:**  
  Update version numbers and maintain change logs within this documentation to ensure alignment with deployed code versions.
