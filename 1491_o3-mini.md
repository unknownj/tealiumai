# GA360 : Set GA360 page_location (&dl) Extension Documentation

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** GA360 : Set GA360 page_location (&dl)
- **Extension ID:** 100040  
- **Extension Instance ID:** 1491  
- **Type:** Advanced Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** Before Load Rules  
- **Occurrence:** Run Always

**Summary:**  
This extension modifies the GA360 page location value that is sent via the data layer (&dl parameter). It determines whether to use a virtual path or the canonical path based on the current URL structure and domain. The code appends site search query parameters (such as q, qp, and term) to the URL when detected and includes support for cross-domain linking (via the _ga query parameter) and paid search tracking (through the gclid parameter). It is designed to handle specific domains (for example, those matching Lloydsbank, Halifax, Bank of Scotland, MBNA, etc.) and provide debugging output when the environment is set to “dev”.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables & Data Inputs

- **dl Object Properties:**  
  - `protocol`: The URL protocol (e.g. "http:" or "https:").  
  - `CanonicalDomain` (cd): The main domain used in the URL.  
  - `CanonicalPath` (cp): The default path of the page when no virtual path is available.  
  - `VirtualPathName` (vp): An alternative path if available and if the domain meets specific criteria.
  - `qp.q`, `qp.term`, `qp.qp`, `qp.l`: Query parameters associated with site search.  
  - `qp._ga`: Query parameter used for cross-domain tracking.  
  - `qp.gclid`: Query parameter used for paid search tracking.  
  - `ut.env`: Environment flag from the data layer, used for enabling debug logging.

- **Global Objects/Dependencies:**  
  - `utag.data`: Used to store and later retrieve the computed GA360 page location.  
  - `console`: Employed for debug output when processing in a development environment.

### Logical Flow & Processing

1. **Initial URL Construction:**  
   - The function `set_ga_page_location` starts by composing the base URL using the protocol and the canonical domain (cd).  
   - It then checks if a virtual path (vp) exists and if the canonical domain matches a specific set of regular expression patterns (targeting domains such as `lloydsbank`, `halifax-online`, `bankofscotland`, and certain MBNA domains).  
   - If both conditions are met, the virtual path is appended to the base URL. Otherwise, the canonical path (cp) is appended instead.

2. **Appending Site Search Query Parameters:**  
   - If the query parameter `qp.q` is defined, the code decides which set of parameters to append:
     - When `qp.qp` is available, the URL is appended with `?q=`, `&qp=`, and `&l=` including their corresponding values.
     - If `qp.qp` is not available, the parameters appended are `?q=` and `&qp_term=`.
   
3. **Appending Cross-Domain Linking Parameter:**  
   - The presence of the `_ga` query parameter (`qp_ga`) is checked.  
   - Depending on whether the URL already contains other query parameters (via the check using `.includes("?")`), the `_ga` value is appended either with a "?" or with an "&".

4. **Appending Paid Search Parameter:**  
   - Similar to the cross-domain linking parameter, the presence of the `gclid` parameter (`qp_gclid`) is checked and appended using the appropriate concatenation logic.

5. **Debug Logging:**  
   - When the data layer environment (`ut.env`) is set to "dev", debug messages are logged to the console indicating whether the virtual or canonical URL was used and displaying the final GA360 page location.

6. **Setting the Data Layer Variable:**  
   - Finally, the computed GA360 page location string is stored in the data layer as `b.GA360PathName` (with `b` generally representing the event payload or data layer object).

### Dependencies & Assumptions

- The code assumes the presence of the following global objects and properties:
  - `utag.data` with the property `ut.env` to control logging.
  - The incoming data object (represented here as `b` and initialised by passing `eventPayload`) includes all necessary properties such as `protocol`, `CanonicalDomain`, `CanonicalPath`, etc.
- The extension is executed in an environment where `eventType` (a string) and `eventPayload` (an object) are guaranteed to exist.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Example 1: Normal Condition with Virtual Path

**Scenario:**  
- `dl.VirtualPathName` is provided.  
- `dl.CanonicalDomain` matches one of the target domains (e.g. "apply.mbna.co.uk").  
- No site search parameters are present.

**Flow:**  
- The function uses the virtual path (vp) to append to the base URL (protocol + `CanonicalDomain`).  
- The debug log indicates that the virtual path is used.  
- The final URL might look like:  
  "https://apply.mbna.co.uk/virtual-path-segment"

### Example 2: Fallback to Canonical Path with Site Search Parameters

**Scenario:**  
- `dl.VirtualPathName` is missing or `dl.CanonicalDomain` does not match the regex.  
- Site search parameters such as `qp.q` and `qp.term` are defined.

**Flow:**  
- The function falls back to using the canonical path (cp).  
- It appends the site search query string, resulting in something like:  
  "https://www.example.com/canonical-path?q=searchterm&qp_term=alternative"  
- Debug logs indicate the canonical URL was used.

### Example 3: Cross-Domain Linking & Paid Search

**Scenario:**  
- The computed URL (either virtual or canonical) already has a query string from an earlier append.  
- The query parameter `qp._ga` and `qp.gclid` are provided.

**Flow:**  
- The function checks if the URL already contains a "?" and then appends `_ga` and `gclid` appropriately using "&" for additional parameters.  
- The final URL might be:  
  "https://www.example.com/path?q=search&_ga=GA_VALUE&gclid=GCLID_VALUE"

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Regex Matching:**  
  The domain matching is dependent on a complex regular expression. If new domains need to be supported, the regular expression must be updated accordingly.

- **Query Parameter Concatenation:**  
  The logic assumes that only one set of query parameters (either the site search or cross-domain linking/paid search) will be active at a time. Unexpected results may occur if multiple query parameters inadvertently lead to a malformed URL.

- **Debug Logging:**  
  Debug output is only available when `ut.env` is set to "dev", meaning that production environments will not log diagnostic information. This may impede troubleshooting if production issues arise.

- **Potential Method Compatibility:**  
  The code uses the `.includes()` method on strings, which is not available in some older browsers if polyfilled ES5 is strictly enforced. (Note: If this presents an issue, consider replacing it with `indexOf("...") >= 0`.)

- **Conflicts with Other Extensions:**  
  Any other Tealium extensions that modify the same data layer variable (`GA360PathName`) may result in unexpected behaviour or overwrites if not carefully coordinated.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Coding:**  
  Although eventType and eventPayload are guaranteed, consider adding additional checks on the properties of the data object (`dl`) to ensure that properties such as `CanonicalDomain`, `CanonicalPath`, and `VirtualPathName` are present and correctly formatted.

- **Modularisation:**  
  Break the URL construction into smaller utility functions. For example:
  - A function to assemble the base URL.
  - A function to append query parameters.
  - This approach enhances testability, readability and maintainability.

- **Code Style Enhancements:**  
  - Continue using descriptive variable names and consistent comments throughout the code.  
  - Additional comments on complex expressions (especially the regex condition) would assist future developers.

- **Browser Compatibility:**  
  - Since ES5 support is required, consider replacing the usage of `.includes()` with `indexOf()` checks to maximise compatibility:
    For example, replace:  
    ga_page_location.includes("?") === false  
    with  
    ga_page_location.indexOf("?") === -1

- **Testing:**  
  Write unit tests for the `set_ga_page_location` function to validate all branches of logic (virtual path vs. canonical, site search parameters, and cross-domain linking).

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  - Assign a code owner or designate a team who understands the specific domain requirements and logic behind constructing the GA360 page location.
  - Maintain a changelog within the code comments (as partially demonstrated with the version comment "v1.6.6") to track modifications.
  - Periodically review the regular expression to ensure new domains or special cases are supported.

- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Ensure you have a robust set of test cases that cover:
    - Different combinations of path inputs (virtual vs. canonical).
    - All query parameters presence/absence.
    - Behaviour under both development (`ut.env = "dev"`) and production conditions.
  - Integration testing within your Tealium environment is recommended to validate that the data layer is correctly populated and downstream integrations receive the expected URL.

- **Documentation Updates:**  
  With each code change, update this documentation page to reflect changes. This is particularly important for updates that affect the logic for URL construction, regex matching, or query parameter handling.

- **Further Improvements:**  
  If additional functionality is required, maintain backwards compatibility by clearly marking deprecated paths and ensuring thorough testing is completed before rollout.
