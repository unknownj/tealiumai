# Celebrus RTIM Code

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Celebrus RTIM Code  
- **ID:** 1506 (with extensionId: 100040)  
- **Type:** Advanced Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** DOM Ready  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Once

**Summary:**  
This extension is designed to monitor and track lead interactions on a webpage using a combination of jQuery (via the LBGAnalytics.$ reference) and custom global objects. It processes data attributes on DOM elements (particularly those with the "data-content-path" attribute) and maps them to structured objects. The extension parses content strings into components (message key, experience name, mbox name, interaction point, and content key) and sends events via Tealium’s utag.track method. Additionally, it handles negative click events, ensures duplicate lead interactions are prevented, and maintains a cache to avoid sending redundant data.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables & Global Dependencies

- **Global Objects:**  
  - `LBGAnalytics`: The primary global object that contains sub-objects for tracking events and leads.
  - `LBGAnalytics.$`: jQuery instance provided via LBGAnalytics, used for DOM selection and manipulation.
  - `window.utag`: Tealium’s tracking object used for sending data events.
  - `localStorage`: Utilised for storing and retrieving lead-related data (e.g. negative click data).

- **LBGAnalytics.leads Methods:**  
  - `parseCMSID(contentString)`: Parses a content string (obtained from a data attribute) and returns an object containing various components extracted from that string.  
    - Uses string splitting and splicing to capture parts of the content string.  
    - Returns properties like messageKey, experienceName, mBoxName, interactionPoint, contentKey, and messagePathId.
    
  - `getAllLeads() / getVisibleLeads()`: Return an array of all or visible elements on the page that have the `data-content-path` attribute.
  
  - `getFailedLeads()`: Retrieves an array of failed leads from the global `window.leadTokenErrors` (if available).
  
  - `getAllResponses()`: Combines both successful and failed lead responses by:
    - Parsing the leads via `parseCMSID`
    - Mapping each to a standard object with keys (messagekey, experienceName, response, inp, contentkey, mboxid, messagePathId)
    - Concatenating both success and failure arrays.
    
  - `responseToCMSID(a)`: Converts a structured response object back to a string in a specific CMS ID format.
  
  - `getAllCMSIds()`: Returns an array of CMS ID strings for all available lead responses.
  
  - `leadClick()`:  
    - Listens for clicks on elements with the `data-content-path` attribute.  
    - Prevents duplicate clicks and fires events only once per interaction.  
    - Parses the CMS ID, then sends out event tracking both for Celebrus (custom handling) and Adobe (constructed as a delimited string).  
    - Updates negative click storage if applicable.
    
  - `prepareNegativeClick(lead)`: Prepares negative click data by setting a flag and storing the lead in localStorage.
  
  - `checkNegativeClick()`:  
    - Checks for stored negative click data and, if found and applicable on the page load, sends an event after updating the response type.
    
  - `clearNegativeClick()`: Clears any negative click data from localStorage.
  
  - `sendEvent(data)`:  
    - Stores the event locally in a "LeadList" within localStorage for historisation.  
    - Triggers Tealium’s `utag.track` event with the lead data.
    
  - `listenForLeads()`:  
    - Sets up an interval (polling every 200ms) to continuously check for new leads.  
    - Ensures each lead is only tracked once through a caching mechanism.  
    - Iterates through DOM elements to add click event listeners to any new elements with `data-content-path`.
    
  - `negativeClickPage()`: Determines if the current page is an interstitial page (based on path matching) which affects negative click handling.

### Logic Flow

1. **Initialisation:**  
   When the extension is loaded on DOM Ready, it sets up the global `LBGAnalytics.leads` object along with its supporting functions.

2. **Lead Retrieval & Parsing:**  
   Elements with the `data-content-path` attribute are identified. Their content strings are then parsed by `parseCMSID` into individual components (e.g. message key, interaction point).

3. **Event Binding & Interaction:**  
   The `listenForLeads()` function continuously scans for lead elements (buttons, links, inputs) that have not yet been tracked. When clicked, `leadClick()` is triggered and:
   - Duplicates are prevented.
   - Both Celebrus and Adobe formats of lead data are constructed.
   - Events are sent via `sendEvent()` and the custom Adobe event is sent using Tealium’s tracking.

4. **Negative Click Handling:**  
   Negative click events are stored in localStorage by `prepareNegativeClick()`, checked on subsequent page loads using `checkNegativeClick()`, and cleared shortly afterwards to prevent multiple firings.

5. **Polling and Caching:**  
   The polling mechanism in `listenForLeads()` ensures that only new and untracked lead data gets sent out, minimising repeat tracking.

### Dependencies
- jQuery (accessible via LBGAnalytics.$)
- Tealium’s utag object for event tracking
- localStorage for caching lead events and negative click data
- Global window properties: `leadTokenErrors` and `location.pathname`

## 3. Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Normal Lead Click
- A webpage element (such as a button) with the attribute `data-content-path` is visible.
- When a user clicks the element, `leadClick()` is invoked:
  - The method retrieves the CMS ID content from the element.
  - The content is parsed into its components.
  - An event is sent to Tealium using `utag.track` with both Celebrus and Adobe formatted data.
  - The lead is then cached to prevent duplicate events.

### Scenario 2: Encountering a Failed Lead
- If a lead has an associated failure (stored in `window.leadTokenErrors`), `getFailedLeads()` captures it.
- The failure lead is processed similar to a successful lead except its response is recorded as "tokenerror".
- This information is then sent during the event capturing phase in `getAllResponses()`.

### Scenario 3: Negative Click Handling
- Upon the lead element’s impression on an interstitial page (detected via `negativeClickPage()`), the `prepareNegativeClick()` method is called.
- If on the subsequent page load there is no immediate negative click set, the stored negative click data is retrieved and updated (changing the response to "negclicked").
- The event is then sent via `sendEvent()` and cleared from localStorage.

### Edge Conditions
- If a lead element is hidden, it is excluded from certain event mappings (visible leads are separately handled in `getVisibleLeads()`).
- The code uses try/catch blocks in various areas to handle any errors from unexpected content strings or localStorage operations, returning empty arrays or undefined values to avoid runtime failures.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- The parsing logic in `parseCMSID()` is built on fixed string indices and may break if the format of `data-content-path` changes.
- The reliance on splitting, splicing and substring operations means that any unexpected format can lead to incomplete or incorrect data extraction.
- The global variable `window.leadTokenErrors` is assumed to be in an array-like format; if not, `getFailedLeads()` returns an empty array.
- Polling using `setInterval` (every 200ms) may be resource-intensive on pages with a high volume of DOM updates.
- Duplicate click prevention is based on a property (`duplicateClick`) set on the clicked element context; if multiple similar elements exist or duplicated DOM structures occur, duplicate prevention might not work as expected.
- The code assumes that the utag.track method and LBGAnalytics.data.leadViewed method exist and operate synchronously.

---

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- Consider breaking the code into smaller, modular functions so that each part (parsing, event construction, negative click handling) can be maintained separately.
- Improve readability by assigning intermediate variables for repetitive operations (e.g. the multiple `contentString.split("/")` calls in `parseCMSID()`).
- Introduce more robust error handling in the parsing function to account for unexpected string formats.
- Cache the results of recurring operations (such as multiple splits) to optimise performance.
- Add inline documentation/comments within the code to explain non-obvious logic and to assist future developers in understanding the reasoning behind operations.
- Although ES5 is required, adopt a more consistent code style—such as standardising naming conventions and avoiding repeated code blocks—to improve overall maintainability.
- Use defensive checks around DOM selectors and utility function returns to prevent silent failures.
- Consider abstracting the negative click handling into a separate sub-module since its logic is complex and can be reused elsewhere if needed.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  - Ensure that any changes in the format of `data-content-path` are reflected in `parseCMSID()` to maintain accurate data parsing.
  - Monitor any updates to the Tealium utag library or the LBGAnalytics global object to ensure compatibility.
  - Continually test the extension across various browsers and devices to prevent issues related to the polling mechanism and DOM manipulation.
  
- **Ownership & Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Maintain a version-controlled repository for the extension code to track changes and roll back if necessary.
  - Include unit tests for functions like `parseCMSID()`, `getAllResponses()`, and `leadClick()` to verify correct functionality under normal and edge conditions.
  - Document any changes or refactoring decisions in the repository’s change log.
  - Consider manual testing during deployment in a staging environment before moving to production to ensure that lead data is captured accurately.

- **Further Enhancements:**  
  - If feasible, review the use of localStorage for potential race conditions or data collisions and consider alternative persistent storage strategies if needed.
  - Periodically review whether the polling interval of 200ms is optimal or if it might be adjusted based on actual user interaction patterns and page complexity.
