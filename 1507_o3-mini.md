## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Celebrus RTIM BLR Code  
- **Extension ID:** 100040 (Internal extension id: 1507)  
- **Type:** Advanced Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** Before Load Rules  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Always  

**Summary:**  
This extension conditionally enables Celebrus functionality based on the environment and hostname conditions. It sets flags (e.g. CelebrusEnabled, CelebrusPreProd) on the event payload to configure tracking for different domains (e.g. test, production, various bank domains) and then interacts with the LBGAnalytics global object to process lead impressions. The code is designed to verify if the website falls under specific scenarios (e.g. dev mode, pre-production domains, certain hostnames) and conditionally enables features or disables them accordingly.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Global Dependencies and Variables

- **Global Variables:**  
  - `LBGAnalytics`: Provides methods and objects related to lead tracking. This extension depends on its existence and specific functions such as `getAllCMSIds`, `listenForLeads`, and `checkNegativeClick`.
  - `b`: Represents the event payload object where flags (e.g. CelebrusEnabled, CelebrusPreProd, RTIMImpressions) are written.
  - `a`: Represents the event type (guaranteed to be a string) passed to the extension.

### Logic Flow

1. **Environment and Hostname Checks:**  
   - If the `ut.env` property in the payload (`b`) equals `"dev"`, the extension sets `b.CelebrusEnabled` to `"Y"`.
   - The extension then inspects `window.location.hostname` to check if it contains specific substrings (e.g. `"luat"` in combination with `"-dmp-"` or `"-dbp-"`), or if it matches known domains like `"mbna"`, `"bankofscotland"`, `"lloyds"`, or `"halifax"`. In any of those cases, `b.CelebrusEnabled` is set to `"Y"`.
   - A separate condition enables Celebrus for any page whose `pathname` (converted to lowercase) contains `"gform"`, typically used for testing forms.

2. **Disabling Celebrus on Specific Hostnames:**  
   - For particular hostnames (e.g. `"calculator.halifax.co.uk"`, `"mortgages.halifax.co.uk"`, `"calculator.lloydsbank.co.uk"`, and `"mortgages.lloydsbank.co.uk"`), any previously set `b.CelebrusEnabled` flag is deleted. This prevents celebrating data from being tracked by Celebrus in these contexts.

3. **Pre-Production Flag Assignment:**  
   - An array `devdomains` lists substrings corresponding to development or testing domains. If the current hostname contains any of these substrings, the extension sets `b.CelebrusPreProd` to `true`.
   - Additionally, if `b.Platform` is `"test"` or if `b["ut.env"]` is not `"prod"`, the `b.CelebrusPreProd` flag will be set to `true`.

4. **Lead Tracking Data Extraction:**  
   - The code checks if `LBGAnalytics.leads` exists. If not, it exits early.
   - When available, it retrieves CMS IDs via `LBGAnalytics.leads.getAllCMSIds()`, joins them with semicolons, and assigns this string to `b.RTIMImpressions`.
   - A commented out block provides insight into a more elaborate flow for handling lead data (aggregating responses, filtering duplicates, and merging with an existing JSON array). This code is not executed but is available for future reference or expansion.

5. **Delayed Lead Listener Initiation:**  
   - A `setTimeout` function is used to delay execution by 100 milliseconds. Within this timeout, the code attempts to initialise lead listening (`LBGAnalytics.leads.listenForLeads()`) and negative click checking (`LBGAnalytics.leads.checkNegativeClick()`).  
   - The try/catch block ensures that any errors during this process fail silently, thus not interrupting the script execution.

### Key Points

- **Hostname and URL Path Conditions:** The extension uses substring checks on `window.location.hostname` and `window.location.pathname` to determine which flags to set or delete.
- **Flag Setting:**  
  - `b.CelebrusEnabled` is used to indicate whether Celebrus tracking should be active.
  - `b.CelebrusPreProd` is used to mark pre-production environments.
- **Lead Data Collection:** The extension aggregates CMS IDs and stores them in `b.RTIMImpressions` for further processing.
- **Global Library Dependency:** Requires `LBGAnalytics` to be properly initialised and available in the global scope.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Example 1: Development Environment

- **Scenario:** The website is accessed in a development environment (ut.env equals "dev").
- **Behaviour:**  
  - The condition `if (b["ut.env"] == "dev")` is met; hence, `b.CelebrusEnabled` is set to `"Y"`.
  - Lead impressions are captured if `LBGAnalytics.leads` is available.
  - Pre-production flag assignment may also trigger if the hostname contains any of the dev domain substrings.

### Example 2: Specific Domain Activation

- **Scenario:** The hostname includes "luat" and "-dmp-" (or "-dbp-").
- **Behaviour:**  
  - `b.CelebrusEnabled` is set to `"Y"` as the hostname satisfies the conditions.
  - Similar logic applies if the hostname contains terms like "mbna", "bankofscotland", "lloyds", or "halifax".

### Example 3: Disabling Celebrus on Certain Domains

- **Scenario:** The website is accessed via a calculator or mortgages subdomain of Halifax or Lloyds Bank.
- **Behaviour:**  
  - Even if previous conditions had enabled Celebrus, the subsequent checks (e.g. `if(window.location.hostname == "calculator.halifax.co.uk") delete b.CelebrusEnabled;`) remove the CelebrusEnabled flag.
  - This prevents data tracking on these specific pages.

### Example 4: Missing LBGAnalytics.leads

- **Scenario:** The global LBGAnalytics object does not include the "leads" property.
- **Behaviour:**  
  - The script encounters `if (!LBGAnalytics.leads) return;` and exits early, ensuring no further processing occurs.
  - No lead impressions are captured and the delayed lead listening functions are not invoked.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Global Dependency Risks:**  
  - The extension relies on the `LBGAnalytics` global variable. If this object is not defined or is redefined by another script, the extension may fail or behave unexpectedly.
- **Hostname Matching:**  
  - The substring matching for hostnames may result in false positives or negatives if domain naming conventions change.
- **Commented Out Code Block:**  
  - The block handling `b.CelebrusLeadData` is commented out. If reactivated, it requires careful testing to ensure duplicate responses are properly filtered and merged.
- **Silent Failures:**  
  - The try/catch block in the `setTimeout` suppresses errors, which means that if lead listening fails, there will be no error notification. This could make debugging harder.
- **Order of Execution:**  
  - The order in which conditions are checked is critical. Flags such as `b.CelebrusEnabled` may be set and later deleted based on subsequent checks, so any changes to the domain conditions should be carefully managed.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Code Modularity:**  
  - Consider extracting the repeated hostname checks into helper functions. This can improve readability and maintainability by avoiding duplication.
- **Defensive Programming:**  
  - Although the availability of `eventType` and `eventPayload` is guaranteed, additional checks (e.g. verifying the type of `LBGAnalytics.leads`) can be added to improve robustness.
- **Error Handling:**  
  - Instead of failing silently inside the `setTimeout` block, consider logging errors to a debugging console or reporting interface, while still preventing any disruptive exceptions.
- **Comments and Documentation:**  
  - Enhance inline comments to explain the purpose behind each condition and action, especially for domain-specific logic.
- **Maintain ES5 Compatibility:**  
  - Ensure that any refactoring continues to use ES5 features only. Avoid using arrow functions, template literals, or let/const declarations.
- **Future Enhancement Considerations:**  
  - If the requirements change, revisit the commented-out lead data processing block to decide if it should be integrated, refactored, or removed.
  - Modularise domain-checking logic so that new domains or conditions can be added with minimal disruption.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  - Document each domain condition change and ensure that modifications are clearly commented to prevent future confusion.
  - Include unit tests for the helper functions, especially if you refactor common logic related to detecting environments and domains.
  
- **Ownership:**  
  - Assign clear ownership or a review process for updating this extension. Changes in external libraries (e.g. LBGAnalytics) should trigger an immediate review of this code.
  
- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Test the extension in each target environment (development, pre-production, production) and under various domain conditions.
  - Validate that lead impressions are correctly captured and that disabling rules work as intended.
  - Check the extension behaviour with and without the availability of `LBGAnalytics.leads`.

- **Documentation Updates:**  
  - Ensure that any changes to logic or dependencies are also updated in this documentation. Maintain version control on both the extension code and its associated documentation.
