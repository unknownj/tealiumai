# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation

## 1. Extension Overview
- **Name**: SCEP Link Decoration
- **ID**: 1508
- **Type**: Advanced Javascript Code
- **Scope**: DOM Ready
- **Execution Frequency**: Run Once

### Summary
The SCEP Link Decoration extension is designed to modify hyperlink `href` attributes within a specific navigation element (`#nav-header a`) of the Lloyds Bank website. The extension appends query parameters to eligible links under defined conditions to assist in tracking user interaction and link performance. The primary reason for this modification is to enhance analytics capabilities without interfering with existing website functionalities.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- **`$`**: The jQuery-like library (assumed to be available as `LBGAnalytics.$`).
- **`selector`**: A string representing the CSS selector to identify the links that will be processed.

### Logic Flow
1. **Selection of Links**: The function `addLinkDecoration` iterates over each element that matches the provided selector.
2. **Link Processing**:
   - Retrieves the `href` attribute of each link.
   - Applies various checks to determine if the `href` is valid for modification:
     - Checks if `href` length is less than 2.
     - Checks if `href` is `"undefined"`.
     - Checks if `href` already contains a query string or an anchor tag.
     - Excludes absolute links (starting with "http").
3. **Appending Query Parameters**:
   - If the above conditions are satisfied, the function appends:
     - `?WT.ac=topnav` to indicate the source of the link.
     - An additional parameter `linkid`, formatted using the current pathname and index of the link in the selection.
4. **Updating the `href`**: Finally, the modified `href` is set back to the link.

### Dependencies
- The function relies on the availability of jQuery (or a compatible library), specifically used for DOM manipulation and event handling. It also connects to the global `window` object to access `hostname` and `pathname`.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Normal Conditions
- On the page `www.lloydsbank.com/current-accounts/all-accounts/club-lloyds.html`, when navigation links (e.g., `#nav-header a`) are rendered:
  - The script identifies all links within `#nav-header`.
  - Only URLs without query strings or anchors are modified.
  - E.g., `<a href="/about-us">About Us</a>` gets transformed into `<a href="/about-us?WT.ac=topnav&linkid=current-accounts-all-accounts-club-lloyds-0">About Us</a>`.

### Scenario 2: Edge Conditions
- If a link already has a query string (e.g., `<a href="/services?ref=123">Services</a>`), it is left unchanged.
- Absolute links (e.g., `<a href="http://external.com">External</a>`) also remain unaffected.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas
- **Limited Scope of Execution**: The extension only runs on a specific page (`/current-accounts/all-accounts/club-lloyds.html`), which limits its reusability on other pages.
- **Impact on Tracking**: If links already have query strings or anchors, they won't be tracked, leading to potential gaps in analytics.
- **Compatibility Issues**: The extension may conflict with other scripts modifying the same links or relying on the same conditions.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring
- **Defensive Checks**: Consider implementing additional checks to validate the `href` format (e.g., avoiding links that start with `javascript:`).
- **Code Styling**: Adhere to consistent variable naming conventions. For example, use `linkElement` instead of `$e` for improved clarity.
- **Modularity**: Extract pieces of logic, such as the validation checks, into separate functions for more maintainable code.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes
- **Ongoing Maintenance**: Regularly review and update the extension and its logic, especially if website URLs or navigation structures change.
- **Ownership**: Assign a dedicated team or individual responsible for the maintenance and documentation of this extension.
- **Testing Guidelines**: Conduct thorough testing using various scenarios, focusing on edge cases to ensure robustness before deploying updates.
