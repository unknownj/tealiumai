# SCEP Link Decoration Tealium iQ Extension Documentation

This document details the purpose, code logic, usage scenarios, limitations, and recommendations for the SCEP Link Decoration extension. It is intended for developers and stakeholders who need an in-depth understanding of the extension.

---

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** SCEP Link Decoration  
- **ID:** 1508 (Tealium extension internal ID)  
- **Extension Type:** Advanced Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** DOM Ready  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Once  

**Summary:**  
This extension modifies the hyperlink URLs on a specific Lloyds Bank page. It targets navigation links in the header (identified by the CSS selector "#nav-header a") and appends query parameters for tracking purposes. The decoration is applied only if certain conditions are met (e.g. the hostname and pathname match specific values and the links do not already include query strings, anchors, or are absolute links).

---

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables and Functions

- **addLinkDecoration($, selector):**  
  A function that iterates through every HTML element matching the provided CSS selector and updates its `href` attribute.  
  - **$:** A reference to the jQuery object, passed in as a dependency (in this case via `LBGAnalytics.$`).
  - **selector:** A CSS string used to match targeted link elements.

- **href:**  
  A local variable within the iteration loop representing the original URL (value of the link’s `href` attribute).

- **i:**  
  An index variable used in the iteration to help generate a unique identifier for each link.

### Logic Flow and Data Processing

1. **Fetch Each Link:**  
   The function uses `$(selector).each()` to loop over each matched element.

2. **Retrieve Href Value:**  
   For each element, the current `href` attribute is obtained and stored in the `href` variable.

3. **Validation Checks:**  
   Several conditions are verified before modifying the link:
   - If `href` is very short (length < 2), the function exits early for that link.
   - If `href` has the literal string "undefined", it is skipped.
   - If `href` already contains a query string (i.e. a "?" character is present), the link is not modified.
   - If `href` includes an anchor ("#"), it is left intact.
   - If `href` starts with "http" (indicating an absolute link that might point to another website), no change is made.

4. **Appending Query Parameters:**  
   If none of the above conditions are met:
   - The parameter `WT.ac=topnav` is appended starting with a "?".
   - A second parameter `linkid` is appended using a combination of the page’s pathname components (excluding the leading slash) concatenated with a hyphen and the current index. This serves as a unique identifier for the decorated link.

5. **Update Link Href:**  
   Finally, the `href` attribute of the link element is updated with the new URL.

### Dependencies on Global Objects or Libraries

- **Global window Object:**  
  Used to obtain `window.location.hostname` and `window.location.pathname` for validation and to generate the `linkid`.

- **jQuery Library:**  
  The code depends on jQuery for element selection and DOM manipulation. The `$` variable passed into the function is expected to be a valid jQuery object (in this instance, `LBGAnalytics.$`).

- **LBGAnalytics:**  
  A global object assumed to be defined elsewhere, providing the jQuery instance used in the extension.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Scenario

- **Context:**  
  User accesses the Lloyds Bank club page at:  
  Hostname: www.lloydsbank.com  
  Pathname: /current-accounts/all-accounts/club-lloyds.html

- **Behaviour:**  
  The extension executes and it calls `addLinkDecoration` with `LBGAnalytics.$` and the selector "#nav-header a".  
  Every link in the header that satisfies the following:
  - Has a non-empty href
  - Does not contain a query string
  - Has no anchor
  - Is not an absolute link (does not start with "http")
  
  Will have its URL amended, for example:
  
  Original href: "/current-accounts/details"  
  Modified href: "/current-accounts/details?WT.ac=topnav&linkid=current-accounts-all-accounts-club-lloyds.html-0"

### Edge Conditions

- **Link Already Contains a Query String:**  
  Links with an existing "?" in the URL are not modified.

- **Link Contains an Anchor:**  
  Links with a "#" are ignored and left unchanged.

- **Absolute Links:**  
  Links starting with "http" (indicating external URLs) are skipped to prevent erroneous decoration.

- **Invalid Href Values:**  
  Links with a very short href (less than 2 characters) or whose href attribute literally equals "undefined" are bypassed.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Specific Hostname and Pathname Conditions:**  
  The decoration only happens when the page's hostname and pathname exactly match the Lloyds Bank conditions. Any deviation (e.g. subdomains, query-driven page content) will cause the extension not to run.

- **Hard-Coded Query Parameter Values:**  
  The extension appends `WT.ac=topnav` and a link identifier based solely on the window location and loop index. Changing business requirements for these parameters may require code updates.

- **Dependency on jQuery Provided via LBGAnalytics.$:**  
  If LBGAnalytics or its jQuery instance is unavailable or modified by other scripts, this extension may fail.

- **No Handling of Already Modified Links:**  
  Although the code prevents modifying links that have query strings, there is no mechanism to detect if a link has been previously decorated by the same process under different conditions.

- **Potential Conflicts:**  
  Other Tealium iQ extensions or scripts that also manipulate link URLs may interfere or produce unexpected results if they operate on the same elements.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Enhance Readability and Maintainability:**  
  - Consider refactoring the validation conditions into separate helper functions. This will make the code easier to understand and unit test.
  - Use descriptive variable names or add additional inline comments explaining each conditional check.

- **Improve Defensive Checks:**  
  While the current validations prevent errors, consider verifying that the jQuery object is valid before proceeding. Although the environment guarantees `eventType` and `eventPayload`, ensuring `$` is defined can prevent runtime errors if the script is reused in another context.

- **Modularise Query String Construction:**  
  Instead of appending strings procedurally, a helper function could build the query string from an object of parameters. This would allow easier modification if additional parameters are needed in the future.

- **Isolation of Global Dependencies:**  
  If possible, encapsulate the reliance on `window.location` into configuration variables. This would simplify testing and development in different environments.

- **Testing the Unique Link Identifier:**  
  Ensure that the mechanism for generating the `linkid` is robust for pages with varying pathname structures. Consider adding logging (if appropriate) for debugging when unexpected values occur in the identifier.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  - Regularly review changes to the Lloyds Bank website structure, as modifications to element selectors or page URL structures may require adjustments.
  - Monitor for any conflicts arising from other Tealium extensions or external scripts that manipulate navigation links.

- **Ownership and Versioning:**  
  - Keep track of changes in a version control system (such as Git) with clear commit messages.
  - Document any modifications or customisations made over time to help future developers understand the context and rationale.

- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Prior to deployment, test the extension on various pages to ensure that it correctly adds (or skips) decoration as expected.
  - Cross-browser testing is recommended as jQuery usage should be compatible with all supported browsers, but edge cases (e.g. older browsers with limited feature support) should be verified.
  - Consider establishing a staging environment that mimics the live website’s conditions to thoroughly test the extension before production release.

- **Further Documentation:**  
  - Maintain updated documentation if additional query parameters or conditions are introduced.
  - Communicate changes with the broader development team, ensuring that all stakeholders understand modifications that might affect navigation link behaviour.
