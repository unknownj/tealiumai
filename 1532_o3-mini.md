# GA360 : Set GA360 Page (&dp) Extension Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive overview and explanation of the Tealium iQ extension code that sets the GA360 page value (and additionally configures the GA4 event title) based on data layer values.

---

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** GA360 : Set GA360 page (&dp)
- **ID:** 100040 (Extension ID) / 1532 (Internal ID)
- **Type:** Advanced Javascript Code
- **Scope:** Before Load Rules
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Always

**Summary:**  
This extension is designed to generate a clean, fully-qualified URL to be used as the GA360 page (stored in the data layer under GA360Page). It assesses the current page’s attributes—such as the canonical domain, canonical path, virtual path, and associated query parameters—and determines whether to use the canonical values or the virtual ones. Furthermore, depending on the scenario, it sets the appropriate GA4 event title. Logging in a development environment (ut.env === "dev") helps debug and confirm the chosen logic and generated URL.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Overview of the Code Structure

- **IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression):**  
  The entire extension is wrapped in an IIFE that receives two parameters (`eventType` and `eventPayload`) which are mapped internally to `a` and `b`. The extension then operates on the data layer object `b`.

- **Primary Function (`set_ga_page`):**  
  The main function takes the data layer (referred to as `dl`) and processes various fields to build the page URL and GA4 Event Title.

### Key Variables

- **Domain and Path Variables:**
  - `cd` : CanonicalDomain (the domain of the current page).
  - `cp` : CanonicalPath (the standard URL path).
  - `vp` : VirtualPathName (an alternative, virtual path if applicable).
  - `ctitle` : The document title from the DOM, used as a fallback for GA4 Event Title.
  - `ga4vet` : GA4VirtualEventTitle field from the data layer, used when a virtual page is detected.

- **Query Parameter Variables:**
  - `qp_q` : Represents the value of query parameter "q".
  - `qp_term` : Represents the value of query parameter "term".
  - `qp_qp` : Represents the value of query parameter "qp".
  - `qp_l` : Represents the value of query parameter "l".
  - `qp_ga` : Represents the value of query parameter "_ga", used for cross-domain linking.
  - `qp_gclid` : Represents the value of query parameter "gclid", used for paid search tracking.

- **Output Variables:**
  - `ga_page` : Accumulates the final URL string (GA360 page).
  - `ga4et` : Determines the final GA4 event title to be set in the data layer.

### Logic Flow

1. **Domain-based Determination:**
   - If the canonical domain (`cd`) matches “secure.bankofscotland.co.uk” (case insensitive), the code uses the canonical path (`cp`) for the page URL and assigns the document title (`ctitle`) as the GA4 event title.
   - Else if a virtual path (`vp`) exists and the canonical domain matches a complex regular expression of recognised domains (including variations for lob and banking entities), the code uses the virtual path for the URL and takes `GA4VirtualEventTitle` as the GA4 event title. In addition, debugging logs are written in a dev environment.
   - Otherwise, the code falls back to using the canonical path and document title.

2. **Appending Query Parameters (for Site Search):**
   - If `qp_q` is detected:
     - If `qp_qp` is also available, the final URL is appended with parameters: `?q=[qp_q]&qp=[qp_qp]&l=[qp_l]`.
     - Else, it appends `?q=[qp_q]&qp_term=[qp_term]`.

3. **Appending Cross-Domain and Paid Search Parameters:**
   - **Cross-Domain Linking (`_ga`):**
     - Appends the `_ga` parameter based on whether the URL already contains a “?”.
   - **Paid Search (`gclid`):**
     - Similar logic to append `gclid`—if the URL already contains parameters, it uses “&”; otherwise, it starts with “?”.  
     **Note:** There is an inconsistency in the code where, in the `gclid` block, `qp_ga` is appended instead of `qp_gclid`.

4. **Setting the Data Layer:**
   - The GA4 event title is stored in `dl.GA4EventTitle`.
   - The completed page URL is then returned and stored in `b.GA360Page`.
   - Additional logging is performed in a development environment for verification.

5. **Dependencies:**
   - The extension depends on the presence of a data layer object (`dl` or `b`) that contains specific keys (e.g. `CanonicalDomain`, `CanonicalPath`, `VirtualPathName`, etc.).
   - No external libraries are used; the code utilises basic JavaScript (ES5).

## 3. Usage Examples

### Example 1: Secure Domain (Canonical)
- **Scenario:**  
  The canonical domain is “secure.bankofscotland.co.uk”.  
- **Data Layer Values:**
  - `CanonicalDomain`: "secure.bankofscotland.co.uk"
  - `CanonicalPath`: "/personal/home"
  - `dom.title`: "Home - Bank of Scotland"
- **Outcome:**  
  - `ga_page` will be set to "/personal/home".
  - GA4 event title will be taken from the DOM title (“Home - Bank of Scotland”).
  - Query parameters are appended if present.

### Example 2: Recognised Virtual Domain
- **Scenario:**  
  A virtual page is used because the domain (e.g. “aip.halifax.co.uk”) qualifies and a virtual path is provided.
- **Data Layer Values:**
  - `CanonicalDomain`: "aip.halifax.co.uk"
  - `VirtualPathName`: "/virtual/deposit"
  - `GA4VirtualEventTitle`: "Deposit Virtual Page"
- **Outcome:**  
  - `ga_page` will be set to "/virtual/deposit".
  - GA4 event title will be set from `GA4VirtualEventTitle`.
  - Development logs will output that a virtual page and event title are being used.

### Example 3: Including Query Parameters for a Site Search
- **Scenario:**  
  A page search query is detected.
- **Data Layer Values:**
  - `CanonicalPath`: "/search"
  - `qp_q`: "loan"
  - `qp_qp`: "advanced"
  - `qp_l`: "en"
- **Outcome:**  
  - If the page is not in the virtual domain category, the base URL (canonical path) is appended with:  
    "/search?q=loan&qp=advanced&l=en".

### Example 4: Cross-Domain Linking & Paid Search Parameters
- **Scenario:**  
  A page with a query parameter `_ga` is detected followed by a `gclid` parameter.
- **Data Layer Values:**
  - `CanonicalPath`: "/promo"
  - `qp_ga`: "GA12345"
  - `qp_gclid`: "GCLID67890"
- **Outcome:**  
  - The final URL is conditionally appended with `_ga` and `gclid` parameters.  
  - **Gotcha:** In the paid search block, the code uses `qp_ga` instead of `qp_gclid` when appending the `gclid` parameter, leading to potential inconsistency in tracking.

---

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Parameter Inconsistency:**  
  In the block appending the `gclid` parameter, the code appends the value of `qp_ga` instead of `qp_gclid`. This might result in the wrong parameter value being set for paid search tracking.

- **Query Parameter Handling:**  
  If multiple query parameters are present or added in future implementations, the current logic may need to be refactored to handle parameter concatenation more dynamically.  
  There is also a dependency on the order and presence of parameters, which may lead to unexpected outcomes if any of these parameters are missing or in an unexpected format.

- **Regex Complexity:**  
  The regular expression used to match recognised domains is complex and may be difficult to update or maintain if new domains need to be supported.

- **Conflict with Other Extensions:**  
  As this extension modifies the data layer directly by adding `GA360Page` and `GA4EventTitle`, there is a risk of conflict if other extensions attempt to modify these same properties. Proper sequence planning in the tag management configuration is advised.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Modularise Query String Appending:**  
  Consider extracting the logic for appending query parameters into separate helper functions. This enhances readability and maintainability.

- **Improve Variable Naming:**  
  Use more descriptive variable names (e.g. `canonicalDomain`, `canonicalPath`, `virtualPath`, etc.) in place of shortened names like `cd` and `cp` for improved clarity.

- **Review Regex Patterns:**  
  Simplify or document the regular expression conditions more clearly. A change in pattern matching might be necessary if domain configurations are updated.

- **Consistent Logging:**  
  Use a consistent structure for logging messages in the development environment to aid future debugging efforts.

- **Error and Edge Case Handling:**  
  Although defensive coding for the availability of `eventType` and `eventPayload` is not required, consider validating other critical properties coming from the data layer (if appropriate) to avoid runtime errors under unexpected conditions.

- **ES5 Compliancy:**  
  Ensure that any refactoring avoids the use of ES6 features such as arrow functions, template literals, or use of `let`/`const` variables in order to maintain ES5 compatibility.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Testing:**  
  Regular testing should be conducted whenever changes are made to the data layer properties or supported domains. Unit tests covering the different branches (secure domain, virtual domain, query parameter concatenation) are strongly recommended.

- **Code Reviews:**  
  Maintain peer review of changes to this extension to ensure consistency with the overall tagging strategy and adherence to best practices.

- **Change Log and Versioning:**  
  Document version changes (as seen with v1.2.0 in the comments) to track the evolution of this piece of code. This practice is helpful for future debugging and for understanding the context of previous modifications.

- **Ownership:**  
  Clearly identify team members responsible for the maintenance of the extension, ensuring that any future changes are coordinated and adequately tested.

- **Documentation:**  
  Update this documentation in parallel with any code changes to ensure continuous accuracy and relevance to all stakeholders and developers.
