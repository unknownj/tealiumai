# Kulu Valley Temp Fix Extension Documentation

This document provides a full description and analysis of the "Kulu Valley Temp Fix" extension, including an overview, code explanation, usage examples, known limitations, recommendations for refactoring, and maintenance notes.

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Kulu Valley Temp Fix
- **ID:** 1533 (Extension instance)  
- **Extension ID:** 100040 (Unique identifier for the extension type/instance)  
- **Type:** Advanced Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** DOM Ready  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Once (Note: Although the extension is classified as "Run Once", it sets up an interval that executes every 1000 milliseconds)

**Summary:**  
The extension is designed as a temporary fix that modifies certain hyperlink elements on the page. Specifically, it searches for anchor tags whose href attribute contains the substrings "kulu" and "?optout". When these elements are found, the extension removes any URL query parameters by splitting the href at the question mark and retaining only the base URL. This ensures that the links do not include the opt-out query parameter. The extension utilises an interval to continuously check for these elements until they have been updated.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables and Global Objects

- **LBGAnalytics:**  
  A global object expected to be present. It is used to obtain the jQuery object (alias `$`) and to store the interval reference.

- **$ (jQuery Object):**  
  Retrieved from `LBGAnalytics.$`, this is used to perform DOM selection and manipulation.

- **LBGAnalytics.intervals:**  
  An object that holds interval references. In this case, the property `kuluvalley` is added to store the interval ID.

### Logic Flow

1. **Initialisation and Global Dependency Check:**  
   - The variable `$` is defined by referencing `LBGAnalytics.$`. It is assumed that this instance of jQuery is already present.
   - `LBGAnalytics.intervals` is set up (or initialised if not already defined) to store references to any active intervals, including the one for this extension.

2. **Setting an Interval (Every 1000ms):**  
   - A setInterval function is created that fires every 1 second (1000 milliseconds).
   - Within the interval callback, a defensive check (`if (!$) return;`) ensures that the jQuery object is available. If not, the function exits early.

3. **DOM Manipulation:**  
   - The code uses jQuery to select all anchor (`<a>`) elements with an href attribute that contains both the substring "kulu" and the substring "?optout".  
   - For each matching element:
     - The current `href` attribute is fetched.
     - The href string is split at the "?" character, and only the first portion (i.e. the base URL) is retained.
     - The anchor's href attribute is then updated to this new value, effectively removing any query parameters.

### Dependencies

- **Dependencies on Global Objects/Libraries:**
  - The extension explicitly depends upon the global `LBGAnalytics` object.
  - It expects a jQuery instance to be available via `LBGAnalytics.$`.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Operation

- On a page where links include query strings such as:
  
  Example:  
  `<a href="http://example.com/kulu?optout=123">Click here</a>`
  
  **Data Flow:**
  1. The jQuery selector locates the above link since the href contains both "kulu" and "?optout".
  2. The callback function processes the link by splitting the href at the "?".
  3. The updated href becomes: `http://example.com/kulu`
  
  Result: The query string is removed, ensuring that the opt-out parameter is not present.

### Edge Conditions

- **Page Load Delay or Missing jQuery:**  
  If the jQuery object (`$`) is not yet available when the interval executes, the callback returns early. The interval will continue to run until `$` becomes available (assuming it is eventually loaded).
  
- **Anchor Does Not Contain Both Substrings:**  
  If an anchor tag does not include both "kulu" and "?optout" in its href, it will not be affected by the extension.

- **Multiple Anchors:**  
  The extension utilises `.each()` to iterate over all matching anchors. Each matching element is processed individually without interference from one another.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Continuous Interval Execution:**  
  - The interval established using `setInterval` is not cleared automatically once the links are updated. This could lead to unnecessary continued execution even after the intended fixes have been applied.
  
- **Dependence on Specific URL Structure:**  
  - The extension strictly looks for anchors with "kulu" and "?optout" in the href attribute. Links that follow a similar pattern with slight variations may not be processed.
  
- **Potential Conflicts:**  
  - There is a potential risk of conflict with other Tealium iQ extensions that might modify or override the same anchor elements.  
  - External scripts or other page logic may depend on the query parameters in the URL and could behave unexpectedly when this extension removes them.

---

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Clearing the Interval:**  
  - Consider adding logic to clear the interval using `clearInterval()` once it is determined that all target anchors have been processed. This avoids unnecessary repetition and resource consumption.
  
- **Improved Condition Checks:**  
  - Although defensive checks for the presence of the jQuery object are included, additional checks could be considered (e.g. verifying that the element’s href attribute exists) to further secure the code, while maintaining ES5 compliance.
  
- **Modularisation:**  
  - Encapsulate the code block into a function that can be triggered explicitly rather than using an interval. For instance, if the DOM content is fully loaded, a one-time execution could be performed without the need for periodic checking.
  
- **Documentation within the Code:**  
  - Add inline comments within the code to clarify the intent of each major operation, which aids future developers in understanding the logic.

*Note:* Keep the code in ES5 syntax by avoiding ES6+ features such as let/const, arrow functions, and template literals.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**
  - Regularly verify that the global objects (`LBGAnalytics` and its `$` reference) are available and up-to-date, as changes in the host environment might impact the extension.
  - Consider setting up unit tests to simulate page states with and without the required anchor elements to ensure correct functionality.
  
- **Ownership and Code Reviews:**
  - Maintain clear version control and documentation of changes within the Tealium iQ library.
  - This extension should be reviewed periodically, especially if changes occur in the website’s link structure or if other scripts interact with the same anchors.
  
- **Testing Guidelines:**
  - Test the extension on multiple browsers to ensure that jQuery and DOM manipulation behave consistently.
  - Verify that no unintended side effects occur on pages where the extension is active.
  - Use staging environments before deploying changes in production to observe the interaction with other tags and extensions.
