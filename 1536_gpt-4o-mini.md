# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation

## 1. Extension Overview
- **Name**: Celebrus GForms Integration
- **ID**: 1536
- **Type**: Advanced Javascript Code
- **Scope**: DOM Ready
- **Execution Frequency**: Run Once

### Summary
The Celebrus GForms Integration extension is designed to capture and send input data from Google Forms and CWR Hub forms to the Celebrus analytics platform. It identifies the type of form based on the URL path and sets up the required data for tracking user interactions. This configuration aids in analysing user behaviour and improving engagement through targeted insights.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- `gFormsCelebrusIntegration`: A flag that indicates the type of form being processed (either Google Forms "G" or CWR "C").
- `pathParts`: An array of the segments of the URL path, used to derive the form ID.

### Logic Flow
1. The script checks the current URL path to determine which form is being interacted with.
2. Based on the identifier, it sets the `CelebrusFormID` in the datalayer.
3. A random `CelebrusJourneyID` is generated and set in the datalayer.
4. An event listener is attached to input and select elements. On change events:
   - It maps form data to relevant Celebrus variables and triggers a tracking event to send this data.

### Dependencies
- The extension relies on global objects:
  - `LBGAnalytics`: A library likely used for managing analytics tracking.
  - `clova3`: Appears to be an API for handling the datalayer.
  - `utag`: The Tealium Universal Tag API used for tracking events.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Flow
- When a user fills out a form on `/gforms/F1234`, the extension sets `CelebrusFormID` to `1234` and generates a new `CelebrusJourneyID`. Once an input or select element changes, the event is tracked, sending relevant data to Celebrus.

### Edge Case
- If a user interacts with a form on a URL that does not match the expected patterns, no data will be captured as `gFormsCelebrusIntegration` will remain `false`. This may lead to insufficient tracking if the user navigates to unexpected forms.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas
- **Incomplete URLs**: The code only expects certain URL structures (`/gforms/F` and `/cwr-hub/`). Any deviation may result in non-tracked data.
- **Multiple Form Elements**: If multiple forms are on a page, only the last interacted form may get tracked due to variable scoping and the event listener being set on all relevant inputs.
- **Dependency on global libraries**: If `LBGAnalytics` or `clova3` fails to load, the extension will not function as intended, leading to missing data events.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring
- **Defensive Checks**: While eventType and eventPayload are guaranteed, introducing checks for the availability of `LBGAnalytics` and `clova3` before attempting to access their methods could prevent runtime errors.
- **Code Modularity**: Split the code into smaller functions for better readability, such as separating form identification, data setting, and event handling functionality.
- **Commenting**: Add comments within the code to explain complex logic for future developers that may work with this extension.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes
- **Ongoing Maintenance**: Regularly review the extension for changes in the external libraries it interacts with (LBGAnalytics, clova3) to ensure compatibility.
- **Ownership**: Assign a dedicated developer for ownership of this extension to ensure consistent updates and troubleshooting.
- **Testing Guidelines**: Establish a testing process for validating data capture across various forms and paths, ensuring no unforeseen errors arise.
