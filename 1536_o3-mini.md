# Celebrus GForms Integration – Documentation

This document explains the Celebrus GForms Integration Tealium iQ extension. It covers an overview of the extension, a detailed code explanation, usage examples, known limitations, recommendations for refactoring, and maintenance guidelines.

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Celebrus GForms Integration  
- **ID:** 1536  
- **Type:** Advanced Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** DOM Ready  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Once  

**Summary:**  
The extension is designed to integrate with Celebrus forms by determining the type of form loaded on the page. It inspects the URL path to decide whether the form is a "GForms" or a "CWR" form. For GForms, it extracts the form identifier from the URL. For CWRs it sets a static value ("CWR"). In addition, the extension generates a unique Celebrus Journey ID (a random GUID-like string) for each form instance. Finally, it establishes an event listener on input and select elements so that any changes trigger a tracking event via Tealium’s utag, along with a mapping of data layer variables to the Celebrus tags. The extension depends on several global objects: LBGAnalytics, clova3, and utag.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables & Constants

- **gFormsCelebrusIntegration:**  
  Initially set to false. This variable later holds a flag ("G" for GForms or "C" for CWR) indicating the form type based on the URL path.

- **pathParts:**  
  An array holding segments of the URL path. Used to locate and extract the GForms identifier.

### Logic Flow

1. **Determining the Form Type:**  
   - The code checks if the window location pathname contains the substring "gforms/F".  
     - If yes, it sets gFormsCelebrusIntegration to "G".  
   - Then it checks if the pathname contains the substring "/cwr-hub/".  
     - If yes, it sets gFormsCelebrusIntegration to "C" (overriding if both conditions are met).

2. **Processing Based on Form Type:**  
   - **For GForms ("G"):**  
     - The pathname is split into parts and the segment right after "gforms" is removed and set as the CelebrusFormID using the clova3 datalayer.
   - **For CWR ("C"):**  
     - The CelebrusFormID is hard-coded to "CWR" using the clova3 datalayer.

3. **Generating Celebrus Journey ID:**  
   - A pseudo-GUID is generated using a string replacement routine that replaces each "x" or "y" with a random hexadecimal value. This generated Journey ID is stored in the clova3 datalayer.

4. **Event Listener for Form Field Changes:**  
   - An event listener is attached to input and select elements on the document via LBGAnalytics.  
   - On change, the code:
     - Sets data mapping on the utag.sender (if available) to map internal data layer properties to Celebrus-specific keys.
     - Retrieves the current values (using jQuery attributes like name or id, and the element’s current value).
     - Invokes utag.track to report a "form" event with the current CelebrusFormID, CelebrusJourneyID, CelebrusElementName, and CelebrusElementValue.
     - The mapping and call ensure that each field interaction on the form is tracked.

### Global Dependencies

- **clova3:**  
  Used to interact with the data layer by setting and getting form-related IDs.

- **LBGAnalytics:**  
  Provides the jQuery-like object for DOM event binding.

- **utag:**  
  The Tealium tagging object used to send tracking events.  
  - Particularly, utag.sender[1222] is accessed to set mapping keys for the Celebrus integration (where 1222 is the designated Celebrus tag ID).

## 3. Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: GForms Interaction

- **Page URL:**  
  Example: "https://example.com/gforms/F12345/details"  
- **Behaviour:**  
  - The code detects "gforms/F" in the URL.  
  - It splits the URL pathname, isolating the form ID ("F12345"), which is then set as CelebrusFormID.  
  - A random CelebrusJourneyID is generated and stored.  
  - When a user changes the value of an input or select element, an event is triggered with data mapped to:
    - CelebrusFormID: "F12345"
    - CelebrusJourneyID: (the generated GUID)
    - CelebrusElementName: Determined by the element’s name or id attribute.
    - CelebrusElementValue: The new value of the input/select.

### Scenario 2: CWR Form Handling

- **Page URL:**  
  Example: "https://example.com/path/cwr-hub/contact"  
- **Behaviour:**  
  - The code detects "/cwr-hub/" in the URL.  
  - CelebrusFormID is set to "CWR".  
  - A random CelebrusJourneyID is generated and stored.  
  - Any changes made in input/select fields trigger data capture using the preset CelebrusFormID ("CWR"), the generated CelebrusJourneyID, and the details of the element changed.

### Edge Conditions

- **Neither "gforms/F" nor "/cwr-hub/" Present:**  
  - The variable gFormsCelebrusIntegration remains false.  
  - None of the form IDs or event listeners are applied, meaning no tracking occurs via this extension.

- **Missing Global Dependencies:**  
  - If clova3, LBGAnalytics, or utag are not loaded or improperly initialised, the code might fail or throw errors.  
  - Developers should ensure these globals are accessible.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Dependency on Global Objects:**  
  - The extension relies on clova3, LBGAnalytics, and utag being correctly defined on the page. Any issues with these libraries can prevent the extension from functioning.
  
- **URL Based Detection:**  
  - The form type detection is solely based on the URL pathname. If the URL structure changes or if both conditions (gforms and cwr) appear, the latter check (CWR) will override the former without explicit warning.
  
- **Random GUID Generation:**  
  - The random GUID generation for CelebrusJourneyID does not guarantee a universally unique value though collisions are highly unlikely.
  
- **Event Binding Specificity:**  
  - The code uses delegated event binding through LBGAnalytics.$. If the DOM does not load as expected or if new form elements are dynamically injected without triggering "change" events after the binding, certain form interactions may not be tracked.

- **Potential Mapping Conflicts:**  
  - Mapping of data layer variables to utag.sender[1222] is done conditionally. If other scripts modify utag.sender[1222] concurrently, conflicts may arise.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks:**  
  - Although eventType and eventPayload availability is guaranteed, consider verifying the existence of global objects (clova3, LBGAnalytics, utag) before using them. This ensures the extension fails gracefully if a dependency is missing.

- **Improved URL Parsing:**  
  - Rather than using index-based substring checks, consider a more robust URL parsing mechanism to avoid conflicts when both form types are present in the URL.
  
- **Modularisation:**  
  - Consider isolating the GUID generator and event listener logic into independently testable functions.  
  - This would improve code maintainability and readability.
  
- **Clearer Variable Names:**  
  - While gFormsCelebrusIntegration conveys the purpose, it might be clearer to use separate variables such as formType, formID, and journeyID to make the logic self-documenting.
  
- **Comments and Documentation:**  
  - Add inline comments, especially around key operations such as the GUID generation, event binding, and data layer manipulation, to help future developers understand the logic easily.

- **Consistency in Code Style:**  
  - Ensure consistent use of semicolons and spacing. Even when supporting ES5, a consistent coding style improves readability.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Testing:**  
  - Regularly test the extension on pages with both forms (GForms and CWR) to ensure form detection works correctly.
  - Use browser developer tools to monitor events and verify that celebratory tracking data is transmitted as expected.
  
- **Ownership and Updates:**  
  - Assign maintainers for this extension to keep track of dependency updates (such as changes in Tealium, clova3, or LBGAnalytics versions) which might impact functionality.
  - Document any arising conflicts with new site functionalities or third-party integrations.
  
- **Logging for Debugging:**  
  - Consider adding optional logging (wrapped in a debug flag) especially around the generation and dispatching of tracking events to aid in troubleshooting issues.
  
- **Version Control and Code Reviews:**  
  - Keep this extension under version control. Use code reviews to ensure that any changes adhere to best practices and do not introduce regressions.
  
- **Future Enhancements:**  
  - Revisit the extension if the URL structure or the Celebrus integration requirements change, and update the condition checks or processing logic accordingly.
  - Evaluate the possibility of refactoring the code into a more modular design should the extension’s functionality grow further.
