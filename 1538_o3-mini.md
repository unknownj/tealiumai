# Persistence BLR Code Extension Documentation

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Persistence BLR code  
- **ID:** 1538  
- **Extension Type:** Advanced Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** Before Load Rules  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Always  

**Summary:**  
This extension is designed to merge persisted data into the current event payload. It utilises the global object LBGAnalytics to retrieve a previously stored set of key-value pairs and, for each item, inserts it into the current event’s payload if that particular key is not already defined. Additionally, it processes an array of cached impressions by joining them into a semicolon-separated string. This approach ensures that valuable persistent data is not lost, while also handling lead-specific data formatting requirements.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables & Global Dependencies

- **a (eventType):**  
  The first argument represents the event type when the extension is executed. It is guaranteed to be a string.

- **b (eventPayload):**  
  The second argument is the current event’s payload. It is an object to which persisted data may be added.

- **LBGAnalytics:**  
  A global object that is assumed to provide a `persist` method. The method `LBGAnalytics.persist.get()` returns an object containing previously persisted data items.

- **p:**  
  A local variable that holds the persisted data retrieved from the global LBGAnalytics object.

### Logic Flow

1. **Data Retrieval:**  
   The extension first calls `LBGAnalytics.persist.get()` to obtain a persisted data object, which is assigned to variable `p`.

2. **Data Merging:**  
   A `for...in` loop iterates over each key (`k`) in the persisted data object `p`.  
   - **Condition Check:**  
     If the current event payload `b` does not have a property with the same key, then the key and its corresponding value are added to `b`.  
   - **Conflict Handling:**  
     If a property with the same key already exists in `b`, a console log message is output indicating that the key could not be persisted because a value was already set.

3. **Cached Impressions Post-Processing:**  
   If the event payload `b` has a property `CachedImpression` and its value is an array (verified by checking that it has a `join` function), the code converts the array into a semicolon-separated string. This conversion is useful for supporting systems that require a string representation of multiple impressions instead of an array.

### Dependencies

- **Global Objects & Methods:**
  - `LBGAnalytics.persist.get()`: Must return an object with persisted key-value pairs.
  - `console.log`: Used here for simple logging to the browser console.
- **Assumptions:**
  - The input parameters `eventType` and `eventPayload` are guaranteed to be defined and of the expected type (string and object respectively).

## 3. Usage Examples

### Example Scenario 1: Standard Data Merge

**Before Extension Execution:**
- Persisted Data (`p`):
  - `{ userId: '12345', campaign: 'summer2023' }`
- Event Payload (`b`):
  - `{ page: 'landing' }`

**After Execution:**
- Event Payload becomes:
  - `{ page: 'landing', userId: '12345', campaign: 'summer2023' }`

**Behaviour:**  
Since neither `userId` nor `campaign` existed in `b`, they are merged from the persisted data.

---

### Example Scenario 2: Key Collision

**Before Extension Execution:**
- Persisted Data (`p`):
  - `{ userId: '12345', campaign: 'summer2023' }`
- Event Payload (`b`):
  - `{ campaign: 'winter2024', page: 'home' }`

**After Execution:**
- Event Payload becomes:
  - `{ campaign: 'winter2024', page: 'home', userId: '12345' }`

**Behaviour:**  
The property `campaign` from persisted data is skipped because `b` already contains a `campaign` property. A console log is generated indicating that `campaign` could not be persisted.

---

### Example Scenario 3: Cached Impressions Handling

**Before Extension Execution:**
- Event Payload (`b`):
  - `{ CachedImpression: ['imp1', 'imp2', 'imp3'] }`

**After Execution:**
- Event Payload becomes:
  - `{ CachedImpression: 'imp1;imp2;imp3' }`

**Behaviour:**  
The array of cached impressions is joined into a semicolon-separated string since it meets the criteria of having a `join` function.

---

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Key Collision Warning:**  
  When a key present in the persisted data already exists in the event payload, the extension will not override the existing data, resulting in a logged message. Users should be aware of this behaviour to avoid unexpected data omission.

- **Dependency on LBGAnalytics:**  
  This extension assumes that the global `LBGAnalytics` object and its `persist.get()` method are available and functioning correctly. If these are not available, the extension may silently fail, potentially resulting in missing persisted data.

- **Array Processing Assumption:**  
  The code specifically checks for the `join` method on `CachedImpression`. If `CachedImpression` is not an array (or array-like), the join operation will be skipped. Developers need to ensure that the expected data type is maintained for consistent behaviour.

- **Console Logging:**  
  The logging is basic (using `console.log`). In a production environment with noisy logs, this might not be sufficient for debugging without a more robust logging strategy.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Improve Logging:**  
  Consider enhancing the logging mechanism to include more contextual information (e.g., current timestamp or detailed error codes) to ease debugging and audits.

- **Modularise Data Processing:**  
  Breaking the code into smaller helper functions could improve readability and facilitate testing of individual functionalities (e.g. one function for data merging and another for post-processing cached impressions).

- **Enhanced Comments and Documentation:**  
  Adding more inline documentation for each logical section would aid future maintainers in understanding the code flow.

- **Validation of Persisted Data Structure:**  
  Although defensive coding for input parameters is not necessary per the requirements, verifying the structure of the persisted data (for example, ensuring it is an object) may prevent unexpected outcomes if the underlying API changes.

*Note: Since ES5 support is required, refrain from upgrading code syntax to ES2015 or later (e.g. no arrow functions or let/const declarations).*

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ownership and Versioning:**  
  Ensure that the source code repository is version-controlled. Maintain clear versioning and change logs for the extension to track any future modifications.

- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Create unit tests focusing on the key functionalities: data merging and cached impression processing.  
  - Simulate cases with key collisions, an empty persisted data set, and invalid data types for cached impressions.
  - Perform integration tests within the Tealium iQ platform to ensure the extension behaves as expected in a live environment.

- **Monitoring:**  
  Monitor browser console logs (or an alternative log reporting strategy) for issues related to data collisions or missing persistence, and adjust logic accordingly.

- **Collaboration:**  
  Document any assumptions regarding the presence of global dependencies (like LBGAnalytics) so that future developers or integrators are aware of the required environment settings.
