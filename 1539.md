# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name**: Persistence in Adobe Tag
- **ID**: 1539
- **Type**: Advanced Javascript Code
- **Scope**: 928
- **Execution Frequency**: As defined by the associated load rule (in this case, there is no specific load rule defined, so it runs whenever the tag is triggered).

### Summary
This extension is designed to manage persistence for Adobe Analytics by storing an empty object in the session storage using the key "LBGAnalytics.persist". This allows for maintaining state or data across different pages or sessions without needing to reload certain variables, enhancing the overall analytics tracking experience.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- `a`, `b`, `u`: These parameters represent the `eventType`, `eventPayload`, and `tagObject` respectively, and are used for managing the event-driven analytics functionality. However, their specific usage is not directly referenced in this code.

### Logic Flow
1. The function is invoked immediately to execute its logic.
2. `sessionStorage.setItem("LBGAnalytics.persist","{}")`: This line initializes session storage for Adobe Analytics, creating a key called "LBGAnalytics.persist" and assigning it an empty JSON object. This ensures that any previous value is overwritten with an empty state each time the code is executed.
3. `LBGAnalytics.persist.cache = {}`: This line initializes or updates a `cache` object under the `LBGAnalytics.persist` namespace to store additional data if required later in other parts of the code.

### Dependencies
- **Global Objects**: The code relies on the `window` global object, specifically the `sessionStorage` API, which must be supported in the browser for this functionality to work.
- **LBGAnalytics**: This variable or object should be defined elsewhere in the codebase, as the script expects to manipulate its `cache` property.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Normal Operation
When the extension is triggered upon a page load, the session storage for "LBGAnalytics.persist" is reset. Data can then be populated in `LBGAnalytics.persist.cache` within other extensions or scripts.

### Scenario 2: Edge Condition - Session Storage Unavailable
If the user's browser does not support `sessionStorage`, then this extension will silently fail without any error handling, causing a potential gap in analytics data persistence.

### Potential Flow
1. User lands on the site.
2. `Persistence in Adobe Tag` runs, and `sessionStorage` is set.
3. Later events can add data to `LBGAnalytics.persist.cache` which can be used for various analytics operations.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Browser Support**: Not all browsers support `sessionStorage`, especially older versions. Testing should confirm compatibility across the target audience's browsers.
- **Concurrent Sessions**: If multiple tabs or windows are open on the same domain, they can interfere with the session storage if using the same key, leading to data collision or loss.
- **Overwriting Data**: Each invocation of this extension resets the `sessionStorage` value. Data should be carefully managed if there are any other operations relying on this key.

---

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks**: Consider adding initial checks to verify if `sessionStorage` is available before performing the set operation.
  
  ```javascript
  if (typeof window.sessionStorage !== "undefined") {
      window.sessionStorage.setItem("LBGAnalytics.persist", "{}");
  }
  ```

- **Encapsulation**: For better maintainability, encapsulate code in a named function instead of an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE). This would improve understanding when revisiting the code later.
  
  ```javascript
  function initLBGAnalytics() {
      window.sessionStorage.setItem("LBGAnalytics.persist","{}");
      LBGAnalytics.persist.cache = {};
  }
  initLBGAnalytics();
  ```

- **Documentation**: Commenting more extensively within the code could clarify the purpose of specific actions to future developers.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ownership**: Assign a primary owner to ensure that updates and changes align with ongoing project needs and that the extension remains functional as requirements evolve.
- **Testing Guidelines**: Regularly test the extension in various browsers and sessions to ensure consistent behaviour and validate that no data loss occurs during session interactions.
- **Version Control**: Keep track of changes using version control best practices, ensuring updates are documented and managing any dependencies or global variables effectively.
