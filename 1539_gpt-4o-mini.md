# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name**: Persistence in Adobe Tag
- **ID**: 1539
- **Type**: Advanced Javascript Code
- **Scope**: 928
- **Execution Frequency**: On every applicable event trigger

**Summary**:  
This extension is designed to manage persistence of analytics data by storing a default empty object in the `sessionStorage` of the user's browser under the key `LBGAnalytics.persist`. The extension also provides a cache object to facilitate temporary storage of analytics data during the session. This mechanism helps in maintaining data consistency across different pages and interactions within the same session.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- **`sessionStorage`**: A global storage object that allows storing key-value pairs in a web browser, accessible only within the current session.
- **`LBGAnalytics.persist`**: An object intended to hold persistent analytics data during the web session.

### Logic Flow
1. **Initialisation**: The anonymous function is invoked with parameters `eventType`, `eventPayload`, and `tagObject`.
2. **Storing Data**: An empty JSON object `{}` is stored in `sessionStorage` with the key `LBGAnalytics.persist`.
3. **Setting Cache**: An object `cache` is initialised under the `LBGAnalytics.persist` to hold temporary analytics data.

### Dependencies on Global Objects
- The extension relies on the global `window` object for accessing `sessionStorage`.
- It is essential that `LBGAnalytics` is defined in the global scope before this extension runs.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Condition
When the extension is triggered during any event, it effectively stores an empty object in `sessionStorage`. This can be observed via the browser's developer tools:

```javascript
window.sessionStorage.getItem("LBGAnalytics.persist"); 
// Output: "{}"
```

### Edge Condition
If the extension is executed multiple times during a userâ€™s session, it will always reset the `LBGAnalytics.persist` value to an empty object. This functionality means any previous data stored under this key will be lost:

```javascript
window.sessionStorage.setItem("LBGAnalytics.persist", '{"key": "value"}');
// After triggering the extension, this will reset:
window.sessionStorage.getItem("LBGAnalytics.persist"); 
// Output: "{}"
```

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- The extension does not handle scenarios where `sessionStorage` might be disabled. If a user has disabled storage, no data will be stored, potentially leading to data loss.
- Conflicts may arise if other extensions or scripts attempt to manipulate `LBGAnalytics.persist` simultaneously, as they may overwrite the data.
- This extension initializes a cache object but does not preserve or utilise it in subsequent executions, possibly leading to confusion among developers regarding its intended use.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks**: Add checks to ensure `LBGAnalytics` is defined before attempting to access it.
- **Code Style**: Maintain consistent formatting throughout the code for better readability, including indentation and spacing.
- **Modularization**: Consider separating the initialisation of `sessionStorage` and cache into distinct functions, as this could improve comprehensibility and reuse.

### Recommended Code Snippet
```javascript
(function(a, b, u) {
    if (typeof window.LBGAnalytics === 'undefined') {
        window.LBGAnalytics = {};
    }
    window.sessionStorage.setItem("LBGAnalytics.persist", "{}");
    if (!window.LBGAnalytics.persist) {
        window.LBGAnalytics.persist = {};
    }
    LBGAnalytics.persist.cache = {};
})(eventType, eventPayload, tagObject);
```

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance**: Regularly review the extension to ensure compatibility with new browser versions and Tealium updates.
- **Ownership**: Assign a specific developer or team for ownership to manage changes and updates to this extension.
- **Testing Guidelines**: Implement unit tests to verify that `sessionStorage` interactions work as expected and ensure no data loss occurs under typical and edge case scenarios.

This documentation should serve as a comprehensive guide for developers and stakeholders interacting with the "Persistence in Adobe Tag" extension in Tealium iQ.
