# Persistence in Adobe Tag – Tealium iQ Extension Documentation

This document provides detailed information regarding the "Persistence in Adobe Tag" extension. It includes an overview of the extension, a line-by-line code explanation, usage examples, known limitations, refactoring recommendations, and maintenance guidelines.

---

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Persistence in Adobe Tag  
- **ID:** 1539 (Extension Instance ID)  
- **Extension Type:** Advanced JavaScript Code  
- **Scope:** 928 (Scope identifier provided in the configuration)  
- **Execution Frequency:** The extension executes on every relevant event (i.e. when the specified Tealium events trigger the extension), as determined by its load rules.  

**Summary:**  
This extension is designed to initialise and reset a persistence mechanism for Adobe Tag data. It achieves this by:
- Storing an empty JavaScript object (represented as a JSON string `"{}"`) into `window.sessionStorage` under the key `"LBGAnalytics.persist"`.  
- Creating an empty cache object on the `LBGAnalytics.persist` property in the global namespace.  

The intent is to ensure that any previously cached persistence data is cleared and initialised at the appropriate time in the tag's execution flow.

---

## 2. Code Explanation

The extension code is encapsulated in an immediately-invoked function expression (IIFE) that accepts three parameters corresponding to Tealium variables:
- `a`: Corresponds to the event type (`eventType`).
- `b`: Corresponds to the event payload (`eventPayload`).
- `u`: Corresponds to the tag object (`tagObject`).

```javascript
(function(a, b, u) {
    // Set the session storage item "LBGAnalytics.persist" to an empty JSON object represented as a string.
    window.sessionStorage.setItem("LBGAnalytics.persist", "{}");

    // Initialise a cache object on the global LBGAnalytics.persist object.
    // This assumes that the LBGAnalytics global object and its persist property exist.
    LBGAnalytics.persist.cache = {};
})(eventType, eventPayload, tagObject);
```

### Key Variables and Logic Flow

- **Global Objects:**
  - `window.sessionStorage`: Used to persist data across page refreshes or navigation. Here it is used to store a persist state as a JSON string.
  - `LBGAnalytics`: A global object that must be available; the extension attaches a `cache` property to the `persist` object nested in `LBGAnalytics`.

- **Function Parameters:**
  - `a` (eventType), `b` (eventPayload) and `u` (tagObject) are passed into the anonymous function, though in this particular code snippet, they are not used internally.
  
- **Code Execution:**
  1. The `setItem` method of the `sessionStorage` object is called, storing an empty object as a string (`"{}"`) with the key `"LBGAnalytics.persist"`.
  2. The `cache` property is added to the `LBGAnalytics.persist` object and is initialised as an empty object `{}`.

### Dependencies

- **Tealium Variables:**
  - The function depends on `eventType`, `eventPayload`, and `tagObject` which are passed in automatically by the Tealium iQ environment.
- **Global Variables:**
  - The code depends on the existence of `window.sessionStorage`.
  - The `LBGAnalytics` global object (and specifically its `persist` property) must exist prior to running this code, or be defined elsewhere.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Standard Page Load

**Input:**  
- A page is loaded and the Tealium iQ event triggers the extension.
- `eventType` is set (for example, `"view"`), and `eventPayload` and `tagObject` contain relevant data for the page.

**Process:**
1. The extension is triggered.
2. The session storage key `"LBGAnalytics.persist"` is updated with `"{}"`.
3. The `LBGAnalytics.persist.cache` object is reset to `{}`.

**Result:**  
Persistence objects are cleared, ensuring that any cached Adobe Tag data is reinitialised.

---

### Scenario 2: Repeated Invocation Without Data Change

**Input:**  
- The user navigates to a new section of the site where the same extension is triggered again.
  
**Process:**
1. Extension again writes `"{}"` to `window.sessionStorage` under the same key.
2. `LBGAnalytics.persist.cache` gets overwritten with an empty object `{}` once more.

**Result:**  
Even if the cache was previously modified during the session, it is reset, ensuring a clean state for Adobe Tag interactions.

---

### Scenario 3: Edge Case – Session Storage Unavailability

**Input:**  
- The browser might block `sessionStorage` (e.g. when cookies are disabled or in private browsing modes).

**Process:**
1. The code attempts to use `sessionStorage.setItem`.
2. If an error is thrown (although not explicitly handled in this code), the extension execution might be interrupted.

**Result:**  
Other parts of the tag that rely on the `LBGAnalytics` object may still execute; however, persistence across page navigations might not work as intended.

---

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Assumptions on Global Variables:**
  - The global variable `LBGAnalytics` and its nested `persist` property must already be defined. If they are not, attempting to assign to `LBGAnalytics.persist.cache` may throw an error.
  
- **Session Storage Vulnerabilities:**
  - The extension does not include error handling for scenarios where `window.sessionStorage` is unavailable (e.g. privacy modes, cookies disabled).
  
- **Order of Execution:**
  - If other Tealium extensions or external scripts manipulate the same session storage key `"LBGAnalytics.persist"` or the `LBGAnalytics` object, conflicts may arise.
  
- **No Input Validation:**
  - The parameters `eventType`, `eventPayload`, and `tagObject` are not utilised or validated in this code. While this is acceptable per the current requirements, future modifications might need to include input handling.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks for Global Objects:**  
  Although defensive coding for `eventType` or `eventPayload` is not required, consider adding checks for the existence of `window.sessionStorage` and `LBGAnalytics` prior to using them. For example:

  ```javascript
  (function(a, b, u){
      if (window.sessionStorage) {
          window.sessionStorage.setItem("LBGAnalytics.persist", "{}");
      }
      if (window.LBGAnalytics && window.LBGAnalytics.persist) {
          window.LBGAnalytics.persist.cache = {};
      }
  })(eventType, eventPayload, tagObject);
  ```

- **Error Handling:**  
  Add try-catch blocks to gracefully handle potential errors when accessing browser storage or manipulating the global object.

- **Modularisation:**  
  If future requirements cause this extension to grow in complexity, consider modularising the functions into smaller, testable units. This can aid in maintenance and improve readability, while still supporting ES5 syntax.

- **Comments and Documentation:**  
  Enhance inline comments and update the documentation accordingly if the extension is updated in the future.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  - Ensure that any modifications to the Adobe Tag or `LBGAnalytics` global objects are synchronised with changes in the extension.  
  - Regularly test the extension across supported browsers to verify that session storage and other global dependencies work as expected.

- **Ownership and Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Assign a team member or team responsible for maintaining the integration between Tealium and Adobe Tag.  
  - Whenever changes are made in Tealium iQ or to dependent libraries, run regression tests including unit tests for the persistence functionality.
  - Document any integration changes and ensure that both the code and documentation are kept up to date.
  - Consider periodic reviews of third-party dependencies to ensure compatibility with browser changes and Tealium updates.

- **Versioning:**  
  - Use source control (e.g. Git) to manage changes to the extension code and its documentation.  
  - Tag releases with version numbers and update stakeholders regarding any breaking changes or recommendations.
