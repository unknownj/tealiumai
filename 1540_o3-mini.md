# Workday Link Tracking Extension Documentation

This document outlines the features, functionality, and maintenance recommendations for the Workday Link Tracking Tealium iQ extension. It is intended for developers, QA engineers, and stakeholders involved in digital analytics implementation.

---

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Workday Link Tracking
- **Extension ID:** 1540 (within Tealium context, with reference extensionId 100040)
- **Type:** Advanced Javascript Code
- **Scope:** DOM Ready
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Once

**Summary:**  
The Workday Link Tracking extension is designed to track click events on anchor elements (<a>) that contain the substring "workday" in their href attribute. When one of these elements is clicked, the extension sends an event to LBGAnalytics with details such as the event type ("External Click"), action ("Offsite Link"), the text of the clicked link, and the URL destination. This enables the capture of user interactions that lead to external Workday links, providing insights for analytics and optimisation.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables and Global Dependencies

- **$:**  
  A reference to the jQuery object (or equivalent) provided via `LBGAnalytics.$`. This dependency on jQuery (or similar) is essential for DOM manipulation and event handling.

- **LBGAnalytics:**  
  An assumed global object that provides the `events.send` method. This method is used to communicate analytics events, and is expected to be available in the global scope.

### Logic Flow

1. **Selector and Event Binding:**  
   The extension uses the jQuery selector `$("a[href*=workday]")` to find all `<a>` elements where the `href` attribute contains the substring "workday".  
   - It then binds a click event handler to these elements.

2. **Event Handler Execution:**  
   When a user clicks on one of these elements, the following data is collected:
   - **Event Narrative:**  
     Captured by `$(this).text()`, which retrieves the link’s text content.
   - **Resource File Name:**  
     Collected from `$(this).attr("href")`, representing the destination URL of the link.

3. **Event Sending:**  
   The event is dispatched using `LBGAnalytics.events.send`, with a payload that includes:
   - `JourneyEvent`: Set to "External Click".
   - `EventAction`: Set to "Offsite Link".
   - `EventNarrative`: The text content of the clicked link.
   - `ResourceFileName`: The href attribute value (workday URL).

### Dependencies on Global Objects or Libraries

- **jQuery (or a compatible library):**  
  Accessed via `LBGAnalytics.$`, ensuring that DOM queries and event bindings are available.
  
- **LBGAnalytics Global Object:**  
  Responsible for handling event communication through its `events.send` method. The extension assumes that this object is initialised and functional at the time of execution.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Normal Behaviour

**User Action:**  
A user clicks on an anchor element such as:  
`<a href="https://workday.example.com/apply">Apply Now</a>`

**Data Flow:**

- jQuery selects the anchor element as it matches the selector condition.
- The click event is triggered.
- The event handler captures:
  - Event Narrative: "Apply Now"
  - Resource File Name: "https://workday.example.com/apply"
- `LBGAnalytics.events.send` is called with the following payload:
  ```
  {
      JourneyEvent: "External Click",
      EventAction: "Offsite Link",
      EventNarrative: "Apply Now",
      ResourceFileName: "https://workday.example.com/apply"
  }
  ```

### Scenario 2: Edge Condition

**User Action:**  
A user clicks an anchor element that includes the text "workday" in the URL but has empty text, for example:  
`<a href="https://workday.example.com/info"></a>`

**Data Flow:**

- jQuery selects the element because the href attribute matches.
- The click event is triggered.
- The event handler captures:
  - Event Narrative: An empty string `""` (if no text is provided).
  - Resource File Name: "https://workday.example.com/info"
- The event is still dispatched:
  ```
  {
      JourneyEvent: "External Click",
      EventAction: "Offsite Link",
      EventNarrative: "",
      ResourceFileName: "https://workday.example.com/info"
  }
  ```
*Note:* If the empty text is not desired, further validations may be required.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Selector Specificity:**  
  The use of `$("a[href*=workday]")` means any `<a>` element with "workday" anywhere in the href attribute will trigger the event. This could lead to unintended event tracking if other elements include that substring for non-Workday related purposes.

- **Element Text Content:**  
  The event narrative is sourced from the element’s text content. If the anchor has nested HTML or no text (e.g. an image only), the captured narrative might be empty or not meaningful.

- **Dependency on Global Objects:**  
  Both jQuery (via `LBGAnalytics.$`) and `LBGAnalytics.events.send` are assumed to be available. If these are not loaded prior to this extension’s execution, the code will likely throw errors.

- **Potential Conflicts:**  
  If other Tealium iQ extensions or external scripts bind conflicting click event handlers on the same anchor elements, the event order or event data might be affected. Testing is required to ensure coordination between extensions.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Coding:**  
  Even though certain variables (eventType and eventPayload) are guaranteed to be present, it might be beneficial to check that `LBGAnalytics` and `LBGAnalytics.$` are defined before use to prevent unintentional code execution errors.  
  *Example:*  
  ```
  if (LBGAnalytics && LBGAnalytics.$ && LBGAnalytics.events && typeof LBGAnalytics.events.send === 'function') {
      // proceed with event binding
  }
  ```

- **Improved Selector:**  
  Consider refining the selector to better target only valid Workday links, possibly by narrowing the pattern or by including additional attribute checks if necessary.

- **Modularisation:**  
  Encapsulate the event handler logic in its own function. This can improve readability and ease troubleshooting of specific parts of the code.

- **Comments and Documentation:**  
  Inline comments explaining each key step within the code can serve as a guide to future developers, making the mechanics clear.

- **Error Handling:**  
  Wrap the call to `LBGAnalytics.events.send` in a try-catch block to gracefully handle any unexpected exceptions, especially if integration points are updated in the future.

*Note:* All improvements should adhere to ES5 standards, avoiding any ES6/ES2015 constructs such as arrow functions, let/const, or template literals.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  - Regularly verify that the global objects (LBGAnalytics and its dependencies) continue to operate as expected across updates in Tealium iQ or any related analytics libraries.
  - Test the extension across different browsers to ensure compatibility with ES5.

- **Ownership:**  
  - Clearly document the ownership of this extension within the internal version control system and maintain a changelog for future updates.
  - Ensure that any modifications are peer-reviewed to maintain consistency and functionality.

- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Create unit tests or manual testing scenarios to simulate user click events on various anchor elements (with valid and edge-case href/sample texts).
  - Develop integration tests if possible, to verify that the event payload is accurately transmitted to LBGAnalytics and subsequently received by the analytics backend.
  - Consider setting up a monitoring mechanism for runtime errors that may indicate breaking changes in dependent libraries.

- **Documentation Upkeep:**  
  - Update this documentation as enhancements or refactoring changes are made.
  - Link to more detailed API documentation of LBGAnalytics for developers who may need deeper insights into the analytics event handling.
