# AEM c-404 Calendar Component Extension Documentation

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name**: AEM c-404 calendar component
- **ID**: 100040
- **Type**: Advanced Javascript Code
- **Scope**: DOM Ready
- **Execution Frequency**: Run Once

### Summary
This extension captures click events on calendar component links within the DOM structure of a webpage. When a user clicks on a calendar link, it extracts relevant event information and sends a download event to the LBGAnalytics tracking system. This enhancement allows for better tracking of user interactions with calendar terms and improves analytics reporting.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- `var $ = LBGAnalytics.$;`: References the jQuery-like functionality provided by the LBGAnalytics library.
- `$("div.c-404-add-to-calendar")`: Selects all calendar component elements.
- `eventTitle`: Extracts the event title from a span element within the calendar component.
- `calendarType`: Captures the text of the clicked link to identify the type of calendar being added (e.g., Google Calendar, Outlook).
- `filename`: Obtains the link reference (href) of the clicked link.
- `label`: Constructs a descriptive label for the event sent to analytics.
- `context`: Defines a static string to provide context for the event being sent.
- `filetype`: Indicates the type of file being downloaded, hardcoded to "cal".

### Logic Flow
1. The code waits for the DOM to be ready before executing due to its defined scope.
2. Each calendar component (`div.c-404-add-to-calendar`) is iterated over.
3. A click event handler is bound to an anchor (`a[target]`) within each calendar component.
4. Upon clicking:
   - The `eventTitle` and `calendarType` are collected.
   - A download event is structured using the gathered data.
   - If the download event functionality is available in the `LBGAnalytics` framework, it is triggered.

### Dependencies
- This extension relies on the `LBGAnalytics` global object, specifically its `$` method for DOM manipulation and its `events.download` method for tracking click events.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Common Scenario
When a user clicks on a link labelled "Add to Google Calendar" in a calendar component:
- The event title is extracted (e.g., "Company Meeting").
- The calendar type is recorded as "Google Calendar".
- The download event is logged, indicating that a user intended to add this event to Google Calendar.

#### Edge Condition: Missing Title
If the event title span is missing or empty:
- The extension will still send a download event, but the `label` will include "Add Google Calendar: " with a blank title. This could result in less informative analytics.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Missing Elements**: If the expected HTML structure (`div.c-404-add-to-calendar` and its child elements) is altered, the extension may not function correctly, as it relies heavily on specific selectors.
- **Conflicts**: If there are multiple instances of jQuery or conflicting libraries loaded on the page, it could lead to unexpected behaviour or errors.
- **Single Execution**: This extension is set to run once. If the web page's DOM is modified after the initial run (e.g., through AJAX), the event handlers will not bind to newly added calendar links.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Event Delegation**: Instead of binding click events directly to links, use event delegation on the parent calendar component. This will ensure that any dynamically added links also respond to clicks.
- **Error Handling**: Consider logging errors when expected elements (e.g., `.cal-event` span) are not found, allowing easier troubleshooting of issues in production.
- **Performance Optimisation**: Reduce DOM lookups by caching selectors, particularly within the click handler, to speed up execution.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ownership**: Assign a primary developer to maintain this extension, responsible for monitoring its functionality and making updates as necessary.
- **Testing Guidelines**: Implement a thorough QA process to test all functionality across different browsers and devices. Ensure that any changes to the HTML structure still allow the extension to function correctly.
- **Documentation Updates**: As modifications are made to the extension, ensure that this documentation is updated to reflect the latest functionality and design decisions.
