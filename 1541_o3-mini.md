# AEM c-404 Calendar Component Tealium iQ Extension Documentation

This document provides a detailed explanation of the AEM c-404 calendar component Tealium iQ extension. It covers the extension overview, code walkthrough, usage examples, known limitations, refactoring recommendations, and maintenance guidelines.

---

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name**: AEM c-404 calendar component
- **ID**: 1541 (as per the provided snippet; note that the extensionId is an additional identifier, 100040)
- **Type**: Advanced Javascript Code
- **Scope**: DOM Ready
- **Execution Frequency**: Run Once

**Summary:**  
This extension is designed to monitor user interactions with calendar add-to event links within a specific component (`div.c-404-add-to-calendar`). When a user clicks on one of these links, the extension extracts relevant event information (e.g. event title and calendar type) and triggers a download event via the LBGAnalytics tracking system. The recorded event incorporates a descriptive label that combines the calendar type and event title, supporting the tracking of user engagement with calendar downloads.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables and Dependencies

- **Global Dependencies**:
  - `LBGAnalytics`: The extension relies on the `LBGAnalytics` global object for both jQuery functionality (accessed via `LBGAnalytics.$`) and event tracking (`LBGAnalytics.events.download`).
  - **jQuery**: Although jQuery is the underlying library, a specific reference (`LBGAnalytics.$`) is used, ensuring the extension utilises a pre-configured version of jQuery that might be scoped to the analytics framework.

- **Main Variables**:
  - `var $ = LBGAnalytics.$;`  
    This line assigns the LBGAnalytics provided jQuery instance to the local variable `$` for ease of use.
    
  - **Within the click event handler**:
    - `eventTitle`: Obtained from the attribute `e-title` of a `span.cal-event` element inside the parent calendar component.
    - `calendarType`: Derived from the text content of the clicked `<a>` element.
    - `filename`: The value of the `href` attribute of the clicked `<a>` element, representing the file to be downloaded.
    - `label`: A dynamically constructed string in the format "Add [calendarType]: [eventTitle]". This label is used as a descriptor in the download event.
    - `context`: A constant string "Add to Calendar" to provide context to the event.
    - `filetype`: A constant string "cal" used to categorise the type of file being downloaded.

### Logic Flow

1. **Element Selection**:  
   The code selects each `div` with the class `c-404-add-to-calendar` found on the page.
   
2. **Event Binding**:  
   For each calendar component, it finds all `<a>` elements with a defined `target` attribute and attaches a click event listener.
   
3. **Event Handling**:  
   When a user clicks one of these links:
   - It locates the closest parent `div.c-404-add-to-calendar` to ensure it gathers the correct contextual data.
   - It retrieves the `e-title` attribute from a child `span` element with the class `cal-event`, capturing the event title.
   - It gets the calendar type by using the text of the clicked link.
   - It extracts the filename from the clicked link’s `href` attribute.
   - It then assembles a label string in the desired format.
   - Finally, if the download event tracking function (`LBGAnalytics.events.download`) is available, it triggers the download event by invoking the tracking method with the extracted values and immediately calling `.send()` on the returned tracking object.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Normal Operation
- **User Action**: The user clicks on an `<a>` element with a target attribute inside a calendar component (`div.c-404-add-to-calendar`).
- **Data Flow**:
  - The code identifies the clicked link.
  - Retrieves the event title from a related `span.cal-event` element (e.g., "Annual Conference").
  - Determines the calendar type from the link text (e.g., "Google Calendar").
  - Constructs the label: "Add Google Calendar: Annual Conference".
  - Extracts the file URL from the `href` attribute.
  - The LBGAnalytics download event is triggered, recording the interaction with appropriate metadata.
  
### Scenario 2: Edge Case
- **Missing or Incorrect Element Structure**:
  - If the `span.cal-event` element does not have an `e-title` attribute, `eventTitle` will be `undefined`. This may result in a label like "Add Google Calendar: undefined".
  - In such a scenario, while the download event is still triggered (assuming the rest of the code executes), the tracking data may be incomplete.
  
### Scenario 3: Absent LBGAnalytics Event Method
- **Troubleshooting**:
  - If `LBGAnalytics.events.download` is not available (either due to a misconfiguration or script loading order issue), the code should ideally not attempt to call the method. As written, it performs a simple check (`if(LBGAnalytics.events.download)`) to guard against this situation.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Dependency on Global Objects**:  
  The extension depends on `LBGAnalytics` for both jQuery functionality and event tracking. Changes in the global object’s structure or naming conventions can break the extension.

- **DOM Structure Assumptions**:  
  The code expects a strict DOM structure:
  - The calendar component must be marked with the class `c-404-add-to-calendar`.
  - An inner `span` element with class `cal-event` must exist within each calendar component.
  - The attribute `e-title` must be present on that span.  
  Any deviation might lead to missing or incorrect data being processed.

- **Event Binding Efficiency**:  
  Attaching a click handler for every matching `<a>` element can lead to performance issues on pages with a large number of calendar components. Additionally, if the DOM is manipulated after the fact, the binding may not apply unless reinitialised.

- **No Defensive Checks for DOM Elements**:  
  While checking for the existence of `LBGAnalytics.events.download`, there are no checks if the queried DOM elements (`span.cal-event`, `<a>`, etc.) exist. This could lead to potential runtime errors if the expected HTML structure is not met.

- **Potential Conflicts**:  
  Other Tealium iQ extensions or external scripts that manipulate the same DOM elements or rely on the same selector (`div.c-404-add-to-calendar`) could interfere with this extension’s functionality.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive DOM Checks**:  
  Although the current requirements guarantee the presence of eventType and eventPayload, consider adding checks to ensure that the queried DOM elements (e.g. the `span.cal-event` element and its `e-title` attribute) exist. This makes the code more resilient against future HTML structure changes.

- **Modularise Event Handling**:  
  Extract the event logic into a separate function. This could enhance readability, enable easier testing, and allow for re-use if similar event tracking is needed elsewhere.

- **Improve Variable Naming**:  
  While current variable names are mostly descriptive, ensure consistency and clarity. For instance, consider renaming `e` (used in the `.each()` iteration) to `componentElement` for better readability.

- **Commenting and Documentation**:  
  Increase in-line comments to explain what each block of code is doing, especially in terms of the business logic (e.g. how the label is constructed).

- **Performance Considerations**:  
  If multiple calendar components are dynamically loaded after DOM Ready, consider re-binding or using event delegation to handle future elements without rebinding the event listeners for every new element added.

- **Maintain ES5 Compatibility**:  
  As per requirements, continue using functions and var declarations. Avoid ES6 features like arrow functions, template literals, let/const declarations and so on.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Monitoring**:  
  Regularly verify that the `LBGAnalytics` global object is properly loaded and that its internal API (especially the `events.download` method) remains consistent with the extension’s assumptions.

- **Ownership and Versioning**:  
  Maintain version control by documenting changes in this extension's README or within the versioning system used for your Tealium iQ extensions. Clearly assign an owner or maintainer who is responsible for updates.

- **Testing Guidelines**:  
  - Implement automated tests where possible to simulate user clicks and verify that the correct download events are triggered.
  - Test across different browsers to ensure compatibility (given the reliance on ES5).
  - Validate the DOM structure, especially after any CMS changes that might modify the expected HTML.

- **Documentation Updates**:  
  Update this document whenever significant changes are made to the code or when new edge cases are discovered. This ensures that other developers and stakeholders have an up-to-date reference.

- **Conflict Resolution**:  
  Monitor usage of common selectors (e.g. `div.c-404-add-to-calendar`) across your Tealium extensions or external scripts to avoid event binding conflicts. Consider namespace strategy or more specific selectors if conflicts occur.
