## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** AEM Link Tracking  
- **Extension ID:** 100040 (with an internal id of 1542)  
- **Extension Type:** Advanced Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** DOM Ready  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Once  

**Summary:**  
The AEM Link Tracking extension is designed to detect and capture navigation link clicks on various sections of a website. It processes link elements, generates a standardized tracking value by combining link properties (e.g. area, depth, index, and link name), and attaches click events to each qualifying element. When a link is clicked, the relevant data is stored in sessionStorage for subsequent use in tracking analytics. Additionally, under certain hostnames, the extension further processes duplicate links to disambiguate click events.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Dependencies and Global Variables
- **Global Object:** The code depends on the external global object `LBGAnalytics` which contains:
  - A custom jQuery instance (`LBGAnalytics.$`) for DOM manipulation.
  - A datalayer interface (`LBGAnalytics.datalayer`) to retrieve data such as the "Brand".
  - A method (`LBGAnalytics.navLinks.storeClickData`) to store captured click information.
- **Session Storage:** Used to store and retrieve click data with a short expiry period (10,000 milliseconds).

### Key Variables and Functions

- **LBGAnalytics.navLinks Object:**  
  This object encapsulates all functions related to link tracking:
  
  - **addClicksToSection(selector, sectionName):**  
    • Accepts a CSS selector and a section name (e.g., "header", "main").  
    • Uses the selector to obtain all matching anchor (or similar) elements.
    • Constructs an array of objects—each representing a link—by mapping over the results several times through the following steps:
      1. **Initial Mapping:**  
         - Wraps each DOM element in a jQuery object.
         - Records the link’s section and its index.
         - Retrieves the link’s href attribute.
      2. **Link Depth Calculation:**  
         - Identifies the parent `<ul>` element and extracts its class name.
         - Strips the class string to obtain the navigation depth (by filtering on class names starting with "nav" or being "progressive").
      3. **Link Name Assignment:**  
         - Assigns the link text or the aria-label (if available) as the link name.
      4. **Link Action Determination:**  
         - Checks the href value:
           - If it starts with “/” or matches a specific pattern with the window hostname, categorises the link as "samesite".
           - If the href is an absolute URL and contains the brand name, categorises it as "samebrand".
           - Otherwise, if the href appears to have a protocol but without the expected prefix, extracts and assigns the protocol (e.g. "mailto").
      5. **Link Value Composition:**  
         - Constructs a composite string ("linkValue") in the format “ELT/section/depth/index/name”.  
         - This involves replacing any occurrences of “/” within individual parts with “-” and removing line breaks.
      6. **Event Attachment:**  
         - Attaches a click event listener to each element.  
         - The click event triggers the `storeClickData` method, saving the computed linkValue into sessionStorage.

  - **storeClickData(data):**  
    • Takes a data string (the linkValue) and saves it to sessionStorage with a 10-second expiry time.

  - **retrieveClickData():**  
    • Retrieves the stored data from sessionStorage and checks its expiry.  
    • Returns the data if still valid, or undefined if expired or in case of an error.

### Extra Processing: Activity Map Disambiguation

- **activityMapDisambiguation Variable:**  
  • Checks if the window hostname matches one of the listed bank websites.  
  • If true, the code scans all links (`a[href]`), groups them by cleaned text labels, and identifies duplicates (link text occurring more than once).

- **Duplicate Link Handling:**  
  • For links with the same text:
    - Iterates over each duplicate.
    - Modifies the clickable elements by appending a sequence number (e.g., “(link 1)”) to help disambiguate them in tracking.
    - Sets a click event (and inline onclick attribute if missing) that updates a global tracking variable (`s_objectID`) with the new disambiguated label.
    - Outputs a message to the console for debugging purposes.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Tracking Header Navigation Links
- **Usage:**  
  The extension is initialised with the selector `.main .header a` and the section name "header".
- **Flow:**  
  1. All `<a>` tags within the header are selected.
  2. Each link is processed to extract the href, text (or aria-label), and its navigation depth.
  3. On clicking any header link, a composite link value (e.g. “ELT/header/nav/0/Some Link”) is stored in sessionStorage.
  
### Scenario 2: Handling Same-Site vs Same-Brand Links
- **Usage:**  
  Depending on the pattern in the link’s href:
  - If href starts with “/” or matches the site's hostname, it is tagged as "samesite".
  - If the href contains the brand name (retrieved from LBGAnalytics.datalayer), it is tagged as "samebrand".
- **Flow:**  
  The classification ensures analytics can distinguish between internal navigation and links leading to other parts of the brand’s properties.

### Scenario 3: Disambiguating Links on Specific Bank Websites
- **Usage:**  
  On hostnames like "www.bankofscotland.co.uk" or "www.lloydsbank.com" etc., the code activates additional processing.
- **Flow:**  
  1. All links are scanned and pruned into groups based on a cleaned up text label.
  2. Identified duplicate links have their click events updated to attach a unique label (e.g. “Link Text (link 2)”) before sending analytics data.
  3. This allows for better differentiation of identical links on the page.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **DOM Dependency:**  
  • The extension depends on the DOM being ready since it operates in the “DOM Ready” scope.  
  • In cases of delayed DOM rendering or dynamically loaded elements (AJAX), some links might be missed.

- **Selector Specificity:**  
  • The extension uses static selectors. If the website’s structure changes (e.g. class names or HTML layout), the selectors may no longer match the intended elements.

- **Session Storage Lifetime:**  
  • The click data is stored only for a short period (10 seconds).  
  • If the analytics system reads the data with a delay longer than this period, the data might not be available.

- **Multiple Event Bindings:**  
  • If this extension (or other scripts) attach additional click events to the same elements, there might be unintended interactions.

- **Global Namespace Pollution:**  
  • The code attaches properties to the global `LBGAnalytics` object and uses a global `s_objectID` variable when handling disambiguation, which could lead to conflicts.

- **Non-Standard Inline Event Handling:**  
  • The code adds an inline `onclick` attribute if one does not exist, which may conflict with other libraries or cause maintenance issues.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks:**  
  • Although defensive coding for eventType and eventPayload is not required, consider ensuring that required DOM elements (e.g. the `<ul>` parent) exist before accessing their properties.
  
- **Modularisation:**  
  • Break the long mapping chain in `addClicksToSection` into smaller reusable helper functions to improve readability and maintainability.
  
- **Event Handling:**  
  • Instead of directly adding inline `onclick` attributes, centralise event handling using the provided jQuery API to prevent duplication or conflicts.
  
- **Code Style:**  
  • Maintain consistent formatting and variable naming.  
  • Comment on non-trivial logic steps—such as the filtering of class names in the linkDepth calculation—to aid future maintainers.

- **Error Handling:**  
  • Enhance error handling in `retrieveClickData` by logging errors for debugging, rather than silently returning undefined.

- **Documentation:**  
  • Include inline comments explaining the purpose of each mapping phase and the rationale behind certain checks (e.g. why a link is classified as "samebrand").

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Testing:**  
  • Regularly test on all supported hostnames and across multiple device types/browsers as the DOM structure and external dependencies may change.
  • Automate tests for the action mapping logic to ensure the correct linkValue is generated under various conditions (e.g. different href formats, missing attributes).

- **Ownership:**  
  • Clearly define the team or individual responsible for maintaining the `LBGAnalytics` object and extensions module.  
  • Ensure that any modifications comply with Tealium iQ best practices.

- **Version Control:**  
  • Track changes to the extension code using version control and maintain a changelog to document improvements and bug fixes.

- **Compatibility:**  
  • Stay aware of the ES5 requirement and avoid accidentally incorporating ES2015 features.  
  • Document any potential conflicts with other Tealium extensions or third-party scripts that run in the same environment.

- **Future Enhancements:**  
  • Monitor usage analytics to determine if modifications are needed for newly introduced navigation patterns.  
  • Consider refactoring into a more modular or component-based approach if the extension’s responsibilities increase over time.
