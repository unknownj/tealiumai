# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive guide to the "AEM Link Tracking (Adobe Tag Scoped)" extension. It includes details about the extension’s overview, code explanation, usage examples, known limitations, recommendations for refactoring, and maintenance notes. This documentation is tailored for developers and stakeholders involved in the management and enhancement of Tealium iQ extensions.

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** AEM Link Tracking (Adobe Tag Scoped)
- **ID:** 1543
- **Type:** Advanced Javascript Code
- **Scope:** 928
- **Execution Frequency:** Runs on each Tealium event when the extension is triggered as determined by the load rule / execution context; its code is executed per event payload.

**Summary:**  
This extension is designed to integrate with an Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) setup by leveraging the global LBGAnalytics object. It specifically targets link tracking by retrieving click data via the function LBGAnalytics.navLinks.retrieveClickData(), if available. The data retrieved is assigned to the LinkValue property of the event payload (b). This enables forward propagation of click data to Adobe tags, ensuring that the corresponding analytics data is attached to events triggered from user interactions on navigational elements.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables and Parameters

- **a (eventType):** Although named ‘a’, this variable typically represents the event type. Its value is guaranteed but is not further used in the extension.
- **b (eventPayload):** This object contains properties relevant to the current event. The extension utilises the `LinkValue` property within this object.
- **u (tagObject):** Represents context specific to the tag. In this extension, it is not directly referenced.

### Logic Flow

1. **Global Object Check:**  
   The code begins by checking for the existence of `LBGAnalytics.navLinks` and further validates whether a function called `retrieveClickData` is available.  
   - This is performed via:  
     `if (LBGAnalytics.navLinks && typeof LBGAnalytics.navLinks.retrieveClickData == "function")`

2. **Data Assignment:**  
   If the conditions are met, the code evaluates whether `b.LinkValue` (in the event payload) already has a value. If it does not (i.e. it is falsy), the function `LBGAnalytics.navLinks.retrieveClickData()` is called to obtain the link click data.  
   - Data is assigned through:  
     `b.LinkValue = b.LinkValue || LBGAnalytics.navLinks.retrieveClickData();`  
   - This means if `b.LinkValue` is already set with a value, the retrieved data will not override it.

### Dependencies

- **Global Object Dependency:**  
  The extension depends on the presence of the global `LBGAnalytics` object and specifically its `navLinks` property. Without this dependency, the extension will simply bypass the data retrieval.

- **External Function:**  
  The function `LBGAnalytics.navLinks.retrieveClickData()` is a crucial dependency that provides the link tracking data. Its correct functionality is assumed, and the extension does not include any fallbacks if the function exists but fails internally.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Normal Operation

- **Trigger:** A user interacts with a navigational link on a webpage.
- **What Happens:**  
  - The Tealium event is triggered, passing in `eventType`, `eventPayload`, and `tagObject`.
  - The extension checks if `LBGAnalytics.navLinks` and `retrieveClickData()` exist.
  - Since both conditions are met, and if `eventPayload.LinkValue` is not already set, the function is called and its returned value is assigned to `eventPayload.LinkValue`.
- **Outcome:**  
  The Adobe tag receives the `LinkValue` populated with the link click data, enabling accurate tracking.

### Scenario 2: Pre-existing LinkValue

- **Trigger:** The event payload already has a value for `LinkValue` (e.g. due to previous processing).
- **What Happens:**  
  - The extension evaluates `b.LinkValue` and finds it already truthy.
  - The logical OR (`||`) operator skips the retrieval function, preserving the existing value.
- **Outcome:**  
  No override occurs; the original `LinkValue` remains intact.

### Scenario 3: Absent LBGAnalytics Object

- **Trigger:** The global `LBGAnalytics` or `LBGAnalytics.navLinks` is not defined.
- **What Happens:**  
  - The conditional check fails.
  - The function call is not made.
- **Outcome:**  
  The event payload is left unchanged. This scenario emphasises the dependency on the external global object.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Dependency on Global Object:**  
  - If `LBGAnalytics` or `LBGAnalytics.navLinks` is redeclared or removed elsewhere in the codebase, the extension will silently fail without providing any error or fallback mechanism.
  
- **Unintended Overwriting:**  
  - If another extension or script sets the `LinkValue` property before this extension is executed, the retrieved click data will not be assigned due to the conditional logic (`b.LinkValue ||`) which protects existing values.

- **Function Behaviour Assumptions:**  
  - There is an implicit assumption that `LBGAnalytics.navLinks.retrieveClickData()` always returns valid and correctly formatted link data. No validation is performed on the return value.
  
- **Conflict with Other Extensions:**  
  - Potential conflicts may arise if other Tealium extensions modify the `LinkValue` property without coordinating execution order, leading to inconsistent or unexpected analytics data.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Enhance Code Comments:**  
  - Add detailed inline comments clarifying the purpose of key checks and the use of the logical OR operator. This helps new developers understand the conditional assignment.

- **Modularisation:**  
  - Consider extracting the retrieval logic into a standalone helper function. This improves readability and allows for isolated testing of the data retrieval process.
  
    Example (using ES5 syntax):
    /*
    function getLinkClickData() {
      if (LBGAnalytics && LBGAnalytics.navLinks && typeof LBGAnalytics.navLinks.retrieveClickData === "function") {
        return LBGAnalytics.navLinks.retrieveClickData();
      }
      return null;
    }
    
    b.LinkValue = b.LinkValue || getLinkClickData();
    */
  
- **Error Logging:**  
  - Although not currently required, consider adding error logging (using available Tealium logging or alternative mechanisms) for cases where `retrieveClickData()` does not behave as expected. This would help in troubleshooting while remaining ES5-compliant.

- **Execution Order Coordination:**  
  - Review the loading and execution order of extensions to ensure that no other extension pre-sets `LinkValue` inadvertently, thereby bypassing this extension’s logic.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Testing:**  
  - Regularly verify that the global object `LBGAnalytics` and the function `retrieveClickData()` continue to be correctly defined, especially after updates to the AEM or related analytics modules.
  
- **Version Control and Change Logging:**  
  - Track changes to this extension in your version control system and document any modifications to the logic or dependencies in the change log. This supports easier debugging and historical tracking.

- **Ownership and Responsibility:**  
  - Assign a responsible team or individual for maintaining the integration between Tealium and AEM. This person should ensure that any updates in the AEM framework or analytics system are reflected in the extension.

- **Review and Refactor:**  
  - Regularly review the extension’s logic (e.g. as part of periodic code reviews) to identify any new gotchas or integration issues. Refactor the code as needed for clarity, performance, and compatibility while keeping within ES5 constraints.

- **Stakeholder Communication:**  
  - Ensure that any decisions related to changes or refactoring in the extension are communicated with stakeholders, including QA teams and analytics specialists. This helps in maintaining alignment between business requirements and technical implementation.
