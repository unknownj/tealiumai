# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: Track Videos

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Track Videos
- **ID:** 1544
- **Type:** Advanced Javascript Code
- **Scope:** DOM Ready
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Once

### Summary
The **Track Videos** extension is designed to track video interactions on a webpage using the `LBGAnalytics` object. It checks if a specific method, `track`, exists within the `LBGAnalytics.video` object and if so, invokes that method. This functionality ensures that video engagement is recorded for analytics purposes, enabling better insights into user interactions with video content.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- **LBGAnalytics:** A global object presumed to be part of a tracking library.
- **LBGAnalytics.video:** An object or namespace within `LBGAnalytics` that contains methods related to video tracking.

### Logic Flow
1. The code first checks if `LBGAnalytics.video` exists and whether `track` is a function.
2. If both conditions are satisfied, it calls `LBGAnalytics.video.track()` to initiate the video tracking process.

### Dependencies
The extension relies on the global `LBGAnalytics` object, which must be loaded prior to this extension executing. It requires that the `video` module is correctly implemented and contains a `track` function.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Condition
When the page loads (DOM is ready) and the user interacts with a video:
- If `LBGAnalytics.video.track` is a valid function, the video interaction event is successfully tracked, thus recording the user's engagement.

### Edge Conditions
- **Scenario 1:** If `LBGAnalytics.video` is undefined:
  - The code will not execute the `track` method, and no tracking event will be sent.
  
- **Scenario 2:** If `LBGAnalytics.video.track` is not a function:
  - The condition evaluates to false, preventing any error but also resulting in no tracking event.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- If `LBGAnalytics` is not defined on the page or has not been loaded before the extension runs, the tracking will not occur.
- The extension assumes that `LBGAnalytics.video` and `track` will necessarily follow the expected structure from the analytics library; any deviation could cause the tracking to fail silently.
- Possible conflicts may arise if other extensions are also trying to modify the `LBGAnalytics` object. It is advisable to ensure no redundant modifications are taking place.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks:** While we are not required to add defensive coding, it is good practice to consider logging or notifying in case of failure to track.
  
- **Code Style:** Use clear variable names and ensure consistent formatting across the codebase.
  
- **Modularisation:** While the given structure is simple, consider breaking down analytics tracking into smaller, reusable functions when possible. This would not only promote reuse but also improve readability.

Hereâ€™s an example of a more modular approach (keeping in mind ES5 compliance):

```javascript
function canTrackVideo() {
  return LBGAnalytics.video && typeof LBGAnalytics.video.track === "function";
}

if (canTrackVideo()) {
  LBGAnalytics.video.track();
}
```

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ownership:** Assign an individual or team responsible for maintaining the analytics extensions to ensure ongoing updates and bug fixes.
  
- **Testing Guidelines:** Establish routine testing protocols for the extension, especially following any updates to the analytics library or related systems. Automated testing frameworks could also be considered for new changes.

- **Document Changes:** Keep a log of changes made to the extension, including any enhancements or bug fixes, to facilitate smoother handovers between team members.

By adhering to these guidelines, we can ensure that the Track Videos extension remains robust, reliable, and maintainable over time.
