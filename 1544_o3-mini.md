# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation – "Track Videos"

This document provides a comprehensive overview and explanation of the "Track Videos" Tealium iQ extension. It is intended for developers and stakeholders who need to understand, use, and maintain the extension.

---

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Track Videos  
- **ID:** 1544  
- **Extension Type:** Advanced Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** DOM Ready  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Once  

**Summary:**  
This extension is designed to trigger video tracking via the LBGAnalytics library when invoked. It checks for the existence of the global video tracking object and confirms that the track method is available as a function. If these conditions are met, it calls the tracking function to record video interactions. This helps integrate video tracking seamlessly within the Tealium iQ Tag Management system, ensuring that video engagement is properly logged for analysis.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables and Logic Flow

- **Global Object Dependency:**  
  The extension relies on the `LBGAnalytics.video` object being present in the global scope. This object is expected to encapsulate video tracking functionalities.

- **Function Check:**  
  The code confirms that the `track` method is not only defined but is a function:
  - `if (LBGAnalytics.video && typeof LBGAnalytics.video.track == "function") { ... }`
  - This conditional check prevents errors if `LBGAnalytics.video` is undefined or `LBGAnalytics.video.track` is not a function.

- **Execution Flow:**  
  1. The extension first checks for the existence of `LBGAnalytics.video`.
  2. It then validates that `LBGAnalytics.video.track` is a function.
  3. Upon successful validation, the tracking function is executed by calling `LBGAnalytics.video.track();`.

### Dependencies

- **Global Library:**  
  The extension assumes that the global `LBGAnalytics` object, particularly its `video` property, is available. If the object or the method is missing, the code does nothing.
  
- **Tealium iQ Runtime:**  
  The extension runs on the Tealium iQ platform and is executed on the DOM Ready event, ensuring that the DOM elements and any necessary global objects are available.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Condition

**Scenario:**  
A website has the LBGAnalytics library correctly integrated. When a video is played or is being tracked:
- The `LBGAnalytics.video` object exists, and it contains a valid `track` function.
- The extension runs on DOM Ready and successfully calls `LBGAnalytics.video.track();`, thereby recording the video interaction.

**Data Flow:**  
1. User interaction triggers video playback.
2. The LBGAnalytics object is loaded with the `video` property properly set.
3. On DOM Ready, the extension checks the object and invokes the `track` function.
4. The tracking event is logged.

### Edge Condition

**Scenario:**  
The LBGAnalytics library is not loaded, or the `track` function is missing/not defined correctly:
- The conditional check `if (LBGAnalytics.video && typeof LBGAnalytics.video.track == "function")` fails.
- The extension does nothing, and no video tracking is performed.
- No errors are thrown, ensuring the overall webpage remains unaffected.

**Data Flow:**  
1. DOM Ready event fires.
2. If `LBGAnalytics.video` is undefined or `LBGAnalytics.video.track` is not a function, the code inside the block is skipped.
3. No data is sent or processed for video tracking.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Dependency on Global Object:**  
  The extension solely depends on the existence of the `LBGAnalytics.video` object and its `track` method. If these are not available due to a failure in loading the external library or a misconfiguration, the tracking will silently fail.

- **Single Execution:**  
  Since the extension is set to "Run Once" on DOM Ready, it will not be re-triggered if video events occur after the initial page load. This might not capture subsequent video interactions if the page is not refreshed.

- **Potential Conflicts:**  
  There is a potential risk of conflicts if other Tealium extensions or external scripts modify or override the `LBGAnalytics.video` object. Care should be taken to ensure that the global namespace is managed properly and that the order of script execution maintains the integrity of the LBGAnalytics object.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Coding:**  
  The current defensive check ensures that both the object and the method exist, which is good practice. However, additional logging or fallback mechanisms could be implemented to alert developers when the tracking functionality is skipped due to missing dependencies.
  
- **Modularisation:**  
  Consider abstracting the tracking logic into a separate function, especially if similar checks will be used elsewhere in the codebase. For instance, a custom function could encapsulate the existence check and call the tracking method, promoting code reuse.

- **Code Clarity:**  
  Adding comments to explain the purpose of the defensive check and the subsequent function call can aid future developers in understanding the flow more quickly.

- **Testing Automation:**  
  Incorporate unit tests that simulate both scenarios (when `LBGAnalytics.video` exists with a valid `track` function and when it does not) to ensure that the extension behaves as expected under all conditions.  
  *Note: Defensive coding for the availability of eventType (string) or eventPayload (object) is not required as these values are guaranteed to be present.*

- **Maintain ES5 Compatibility:**  
  Continue using ES5 syntax to ensure compatibility with the environments where the extension will be deployed. Avoid any ES6 features such as arrow functions, template literals, and the use of let/const.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  Regularly review the integration points with the LBGAnalytics library to ensure that updates to the external library do not break the tracking functionality.

- **Ownership:**  
  Clearly define the ownership of this extension within the development team. Responsible parties should be assigned for periodic reviews and updates.

- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Execute both manual and automated tests to monitor the extension’s performance, particularly after any changes to the Tealium iQ configurations or LBGAnalytics library.
  - Validate the extension across multiple browsers to ensure consistent behaviour.
  - Ensure that any changes to the file or dependent libraries trigger regression testing to confirm that the video tracking continues to function as expected.

- **Documentation Updates:**  
  Update this documentation when any modifications are made to the extension, including changes in logic or dependencies. This helps maintain a clear history of changes and assists debugging in case of future issues.
