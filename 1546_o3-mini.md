# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: Step Number Offset

This document provides an in‐depth explanation of the "Step Number Offset" extension, describing its purpose, code logic, usage scenarios, limitations, refactoring recommendations, and maintenance guidelines.

---

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Step Number Offset  
- **ID:** 1546  
- **Extension Type:** Advanced Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** After Load Rules  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Always

**Summary:**  
This extension adjusts the value of the JourneyStep property in the event payload by adding an offset. It takes two values from the `eventPayload` object—`JourneyStep` and `JourneyStepOffset`—converts them to numbers (if possible), adds them together, assigns the sum back to `JourneyStep`, and deletes the `JourneyStepOffset` property. This ensures that downstream processes receive the correctly offset step number.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables and Functions

- **`toNumber` Function:**  
  A helper function that attempts to convert an input value to a number.
  - If the input is already a number, it returns the same value.
  - If the input is not of type number but can be coerced to one (i.e. it's numeric-like), it returns the numeric value.
  - If conversion fails, it returns `false`.

- **`js` Variable:**  
  Stores the numeric value for `JourneyStep` obtained from `eventPayload` via the helper function.

- **`jso` Variable:**  
  Stores the numeric value for `JourneyStepOffset` from `eventPayload` passed through the same helper function.

### Logic Flow

1. **Conversion Attempt:**  
   The code attempts to convert both `b.JourneyStep` and `b.JourneyStepOffset` to numbers using the `toNumber` function.

2. **Validation Check:**  
   The code checks if both conversions were successful (i.e. neither returned `false`).

3. **Data Processing:**  
   - If valid, the two values are summed up.
   - The combined total is then reassigned to the `JourneyStep` property of the event payload.
   - The `JourneyStepOffset` property is removed from the event data.

4. **Execution Context:**  
   The function immediately executes using the global objects provided by Tealium (`eventType` and `eventPayload`, referred to respectively as `a` and `b` in the function parameters).

### Dependencies

- **Global Objects:**  
  - `eventType` (alias `a`): Typically a string denoting the event type.
  - `eventPayload` (alias `b`): An object carrying all event-related data, including the properties `JourneyStep` and `JourneyStepOffset`.

- **No External Libraries:**  
  The extension does not rely on other libraries; it is completely self-contained.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Conditions

**Example 1: Valid Numeric Values**

- **Input:**  
  ```javascript
  eventPayload.JourneyStep = "3";         // A string that looks like a number.
  eventPayload.JourneyStepOffset = 2;       // A valid number.
  ```
- **Processing:**  
  - `toNumber("3")` returns 3.
  - `toNumber(2)` returns 2.
  - The new `JourneyStep` will be calculated as 3 + 2 = 5.
  - `JourneyStepOffset` is then removed from the payload.
- **Output:**  
  ```javascript
  eventPayload.JourneyStep = 5;
  // eventPayload.JourneyStepOffset is now deleted.
  ```

### Edge Conditions

**Example 2: Non-Numeric Input**

- **Input:**  
  ```javascript
  eventPayload.JourneyStep = "abc";
  eventPayload.JourneyStepOffset = "2";   // Even though "2" is numeric-like, the first conversion fails.
  ```
- **Processing:**  
  - `toNumber("abc")` returns `false` because "abc" is not numeric.
  - Since one of the conversions fails, no calculation is performed.
- **Output:**  
  The event payload remains unchanged.

**Example 3: Missing Offset Value**

- **Input:**  
  ```javascript
  eventPayload.JourneyStep = 4;
  // eventPayload.JourneyStepOffset is undefined.
  ```
- **Processing:**  
  - Attempting conversion of an undefined `JourneyStepOffset` will result in `toNumber(undefined)` returning `false`.
  - No summation or deletion occurs.
- **Output:**  
  The event payload remains unchanged.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Invalid Input Handling:**  
  If either `JourneyStep` or `JourneyStepOffset` cannot be converted to a numeric value, the extension will not alter the payload. This is by design to prevent erroneous data operations but may require prior validation in some implementations.

- **Type Assumptions:**  
  The extension assumes that the properties in the event payload are either convertible to a number or left unchanged. Non-numeric strings or missing values will cause the computation to be skipped.

- **Potential Conflicts:**  
  - Overlapping properties: If other Tealium extensions similarly manipulate `JourneyStep` or `JourneyStepOffset`, conflicts might occur.
  - Execution Order: Because the extension runs "After Load Rules", it is important to ensure that any other extensions relying on modified values run subsequently.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Coding:**  
  While the code already uses a try-catch block in `toNumber` for conversion, additional logging for conversion failures could improve troubleshooting.
  
- **Code Clarity:**  
  Consider adding inline comments explaining each key step. For example, annotate why the deletion of `JourneyStepOffset` is performed.

- **Modularisation:**  
  The conversion function and the primary execution code could be separated into more modular functions if the scope were to grow. However, given the restrictions to support ES5, this structure remains clear and concise.

- **Testing Improvements:**  
  Develop unit tests for the `toNumber` function to ensure it correctly handles various inputs (strings, numbers, undefined, non-numeric strings, etc.).

- **Logging:**  
  Although not part of ES5 best practices, consider integrating simple logging (if permitted by the environment) to track when conversion errors occur, especially in a production environment.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  - Document changes clearly in version control.
  - Review any updates to the Tealium platform that might affect execution timing or payload structure.
  - Ensure compatibility after migrating to newer versions of Tealium, keeping the ES5 requirement in mind.

- **Ownership:**  
  The extension should have a clearly designated owner or maintainer who tracks its performance in production, especially if used in critical customer journeys.

- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Regularly test the extension in a staging environment with various payload scenarios.
  - Validate that downstream processes receive the correct modified values.
  - Incorporate regression tests to ensure that future updates do not break the integration.

- **Documentation Updates:**  
  Update this documentation as new requirements or external integrations are introduced. Maintain version history within the documentation for clarity.
