# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: LivePerson Override on OD PLD Page

## 1. Extension Overview
- **Name**: LivePerson Override on OD PLD page
- **ID**: 1552
- **Type**: Advanced Javascript Code
- **Scope**: After Load Rules
- **Execution Frequency**: Run Always

### Summary
This extension is designed to override the standard chat prompt functionality when a user is on the "Overdraft Referred PLD" page. It leverages the LivePerson chat system by manipulating the `lpTag.newPage` method, which is responsible for updating the page context within the chat application. The primary purpose of this extension is to enhance the user experience by ensuring relevant chat interactions on the specific page do not use the default prompt.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- **b.JourneyStepName**: This variable holds the name of the current journey step, which is expected to be checked against a specific value ("overdraft referred pld").
- **window.lpTag**: A global object associated with LivePerson's chat integration that provides various methods, including `newPage`.

### Logic Flow
1. The extension first checks whether:
   - The `JourneyStepName` exists and is equal to "overdraft referred pld" (case-insensitive).
   - The `window.lpTag` object is available and that it contains the `newPage` function.

2. If the conditions are met, it schedules several executions of the `newPage` method at different time intervals:
   - At 50 milliseconds, it disables the standard chat prompt by logging a message and calling `newPage`.
   - At 1050 milliseconds and 2050 milliseconds, it calls `newPage` again. This is likely to ensure the chat integration reflects the current page state after some delay.

### Dependencies
- The code depends on the global `window.lpTag` object provided by LivePerson's chat library and assumes that the `newPage` method exists within that object.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Typical Scenario
When a user navigates to the "Overdraft Referred PLD" page:
- The extension checks the current journey step.
- If matched, it modifies the chat system's state by calling `window.lpTag.newPage` multiple times at specified intervals.
- The logged message indicates that the standard chat prompt is being suppressed, allowing for a more tailored user experience.

### Edge Conditions
1. **When `JourneyStepName` does not match**:
   - The code will not execute any of the `setTimeout` functions, thus preserving the default chat prompt behaviour.

2. **When `window.lpTag.newPage` is not a function**:
   - The extension does not execute the chat modification logic, preventing potential errors if the LivePerson library is not loaded correctly.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas
- The extension relies entirely on the presence of the `lpTag` object. If this library is not loaded, the extension does not have fallback functionality.
- If multiple extensions or scripts are manipulating the LivePerson chat state simultaneously, conflicts may arise, leading to inconsistent user experiences.
- The specific timing of the `setTimeout` functions (50ms, 1050ms, and 2050ms) is arbitrary; changes to page load times or chat system response times may require adjustments.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring
- **Code Style**: Ensure consistent indentation and spacing for better readability.
- **Modularisation**: Consider breaking out the timeout logic into a separate function to improve maintainability and clarity. This would allow easier adjustments if the execution timings need to change.
- **Logging Levels**: Rather than using `console.log`, consider implementing a more robust logging mechanism that can be easily toggled or configured for different environments (e.g., development vs. production).

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes
- **Owner**: It's recommended to assign a dedicated developer or team responsible for ongoing maintenance of the extension.
- **Testing Guidelines**: Regularly test the extension in different environments and conditions, especially following updates to the LivePerson library or site architecture changes.
- **Documentation Updates**: Ensure this documentation is regularly updated to reflect any changes to the extensionâ€™s logic or behaviour. Periodic reviews can help catch potential issues caused by changes in dependencies or the user interface.

By following the best practices outlined here, developers will ensure that the extension remains robust, maintainable, and aligned with overall user experience goals.
