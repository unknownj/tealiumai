# LivePerson Override on OD PLD Page Extension Documentation

This document provides an in-depth explanation of the "LivePerson Override on OD PLD page" extension for Tealium iQ, including its overview, code breakdown, usage examples, known limitations, refactoring recommendations, and maintenance notes.

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** LivePerson Override on OD PLD page  
- **ID:** 1552  
- **Type:** Advanced Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** After Load Rules  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Always  

**Summary:**  
This extension is designed to override or disable the standard chat prompt provided by the LivePerson integration on pages where the customer journey step is identified as "Overdraft Referred PLD". It checks a specific property within the event payload and, if the conditions are met, repeatedly calls the LivePerson method (window.lpTag.newPage) on the current URL at various time intervals. This approach helps ensure that the standard chat prompt is disabled in favour of a customised behaviour suited for specific page contexts.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables and Parameters

- **a (eventType):** The first parameter passed to the Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE). Although this parameter is present, it is not used explicitly within the code.
- **b (eventPayload):** The second parameter, assumed to be an object containing various event properties. The code specifically checks the property `JourneyStepName` from this object.

### Logic Flow

1. **Condition Check:**
   - The extension first verifies whether `b.JourneyStepName` is defined.
   - It converts the value of `b.JourneyStepName` to lowercase and checks if it matches the string `"overdraft referred pld"`.
   - Next, it checks for the presence of the global object `window.lpTag` and confirms that `window.lpTag.newPage` is a function.

2. **Timed Execution:**
   - If all the above conditions are met, the code schedules three calls to `window.lpTag.newPage` using `setTimeout` with the following delays:
     - **After 50 milliseconds:** Logs a message to the console ("Disabling standard chat prompt") and calls `window.lpTag.newPage` with the current URL.
     - **After 1050 milliseconds:** Calls `window.lpTag.newPage` again.
     - **After 2050 milliseconds:** Calls `window.lpTag.newPage` once more.

### Dependencies and External Objects

- **Global Object (window.lpTag):**  
  The extension relies on the presence of the LivePerson tag library (`window.lpTag`), specifically the method `newPage`, to trigger an update or reset of the chat interface on the page.
  
- **Event Payload:**  
  The code depends on the event payload (`eventPayload`) having a `JourneyStepName` property that accurately reflects the current phase in the customer journey.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Sample Scenario 1: Normal Conditions

- **Input:**  
  - eventPayload contains `JourneyStepName` set to "Overdraft Referred PLD" (case insensitive check passes).
  - The global object `window.lpTag` is defined and has the function `newPage`.

- **Behaviour:**  
  - The condition is met and the extension schedules three successive calls to `newPage` at 50ms, 1050ms, and 2050ms.
  - Console outputs "Disabling standard chat prompt" at the 50ms mark.
  - The LivePerson chat prompt is disabled or refreshed on the current URL.

### Sample Scenario 2: Journey Step Mismatch

- **Input:**  
  - eventPayload contains `JourneyStepName` set to "Some Other Journey" or is missing.
  
- **Behaviour:**  
  - The condition fails.
  - None of the `setTimeout` functions are executed.
  - The standard LivePerson chat interface remains unaffected.

### Sample Scenario 3: LivePerson Library Not Loaded

- **Input:**  
  - eventPayload contains `JourneyStepName` with the correct value ("Overdraft Referred PLD") but `window.lpTag` is undefined or `newPage` is not a function.
  
- **Behaviour:**  
  - The code does not enter the conditional block as the necessary LivePerson functions are not available.
  - No calls to `newPage` are attempted; hence, no chat prompt override occurs.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Dependence on Global Library:**  
  - The extension heavily relies on the LivePerson global object (`window.lpTag`) and its `newPage` method. If there are loading issues or conflicts with the LivePerson library, the extension will not function as intended.

- **Timing Sensitivity:**  
  - The specific delays (50ms, 1050ms, 2050ms) assume that the LivePerson library is fully initialised by those times. Variations in page load speed or asynchronous loading delays could potentially result in skipped or ineffective calls.

- **Potential Conflicts:**  
  - If other Tealium iQ extensions or external scripts are also manipulating `window.lpTag.newPage`, they might interfere with the repeated calls scheduled in this extension.
  - There might be an overlap in functionality if multiple extensions attempt to override the chat prompt behaviour.

- **No Error Handling:**  
  - There is no try-catch mechanism in place. Should `window.lpTag.newPage` fail or if unexpected data types are encountered, the errors could disrupt subsequent script executions.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Programming Enhancements:**  
  - Although checks for `window.lpTag` and `newPage` exist, consider logging or handling cases where the expected methods are undefined to assist with debugging. This would include verifying that `newPage` is a function before each call, although it is known to exist before entering the code block.

- **Modularisation of Repeated Code:**  
  - The repeated calls to `window.lpTag.newPage(window.location.href)` could be refactored into a separate function (e.g. `triggerNewPage()`). This approach would reduce code duplication and make adjustments easier if the logic for invoking `newPage` needs to be modified.

- **Parameterise Delays:**  
  - Define the delay durations as constant variables at the beginning of the script. This would make the code easier to adjust and maintain, as changes to the timing only need to occur in one place.

- **Code Commenting and Documentation:**  
  - Increase inline documentation to explain the rationale behind the chosen delay intervals and the expected behaviour. This is especially useful for developers new to the project or troubleshooting issues.

- **Maintain ES5 Compatibility:**  
  - Continue to use ES5 syntax, avoiding any ES6+ features such as arrow functions, template literals, or block-scoped variables. This maintains compatibility with existing environments that require ES5.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Testing:**  
  - Regularly test the extension in staging environments to ensure it remains compatible with any updates to the LivePerson library or changes in the page load behaviour.
  - Automated tests should be considered to verify that `JourneyStepName` conditions are correctly detected and that the `newPage` function is called at the appropriate intervals.

- **Ownership and Version Control:**  
  - Maintain version history and clear documentation within the Tealium iQ extension repository. Indicate which team or individual is responsible for updates and debugging.
  - Document any changes or patches in a changelog to assist future developers in understanding the evolution of the extension.

- **Monitoring for Conflicts:**  
  - Continuously monitor for potential conflicts with other Tealium extensions or external scripts that might be manipulating the LivePerson chat interface.
  - Evaluate if a more centralised implementation strategy might reduce duplication and conflicts among various overrides provided by different extensions.

- **Future Enhancements:**  
  - Evaluate the need for dynamic adjustment of the delay intervals based on performance analytics or user reports.
  - Consider integrating with logging platforms to track how frequently the override occurs and to capture any errors or discrepancies during runtime.
