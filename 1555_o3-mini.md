# GA360: Test for Duplicate Tag Load Extension Documentation

This documentation details the Tealium iQ extension which tests for duplicate tag loads in specific PCA journeys.

---

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** GA360 : Test for duplicate tag load
- **ID:** 1555
- **Extension Type:** Advanced Javascript Code
- **Scope:** Before Load Rules
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Always

**Summary:**  
This extension checks whether a duplicate tag load has occurred in a PCA journey. It does so by comparing the values in the data layer (namely, JourneyStep and JourneyUniqueID) with the persisted values (cp.utag_main_js and cp.utag_main_juid). Depending on whether these values match, the extension returns a Boolean value (true for a duplicate tag load, false otherwise). This result is stored in a variable labelled "isPCADuplicateTagLoad".

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables

- **dl (datalayer):**  
  The object (typically eventPayload) containing the current session data.

- **journey_step:**  
  Assigned from `dl.JourneyStep`, representing the current journey step in the data layer.

- **journey_step_cp:**  
  Assigned from `dl["cp.utag_main_js"]`, representing the persisted (or previously captured) journey step.

- **journey_unique_id:**  
  Assigned from `dl.JourneyUniqueID`, representing the unique identifier of the current journey.

- **journey_unique_id_cp:**  
  Assigned from `dl["cp.utag_main_juid"]`, representing the persisted (or previously captured) unique journey identifier.

### Logic Flow

1. **Primary Check:**  
   If both `journey_step_cp` and `journey_unique_id_cp` are defined (or truthy) then:
   - Compare `journey_unique_id` with `journey_unique_id_cp` and `journey_step` with `journey_step_cp`.
   - If both comparisons are equal, return true (indicating a duplicate tag load); otherwise, return false.

2. **Secondary Check:**  
   If `journey_step_cp` is defined but `journey_unique_id_cp` is either `"undefined"` (as a string) or `null`:
   - Only `journey_step` is compared with `journey_step_cp`.
   - Return true if they match; otherwise, return false.

3. **Default Case:**  
   If neither persistence value is defined (i.e. both `journey_step_cp` and `journey_unique_id_cp` are either `"undefined"` or `null`):
   - The function returns false.  
   (Note: This default branch is applied even if one of the cp values is missing.)

### Dependencies

- **Global Objects:**  
  The extension relies on `eventType` and `eventPayload`, which are provided externally by Tealium iQ.  
- **No External Libraries:**  
  The code is self-contained and does not use any external libraries. It is written in ES5-compatible JavaScript.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Example 1 – Normal Conditions

**Input Data Layer (dl):**
```javascript
{
    "JourneyStep": "Step1",
    "JourneyUniqueID": "UID123",
    "cp.utag_main_js": "Step1",
    "cp.utag_main_juid": "UID123"
}
```
**Outcome:**  
Since both the journey step and unique ID match between the current data layer and persisted values, the function returns **true**, indicating a duplicate load.

---

### Example 2 – Mismatch Between Current and Persisted Values

**Input Data Layer (dl):**
```javascript
{
    "JourneyStep": "Step1",
    "JourneyUniqueID": "UID123",
    "cp.utag_main_js": "Step2",
    "cp.utag_main_juid": "UID123"
}
```
**Outcome:**  
The journey steps do not match, so the function returns **false**.

---

### Example 3 – Persisted Unique ID is Missing

**Input Data Layer (dl):**
```javascript
{
    "JourneyStep": "Step1",
    "JourneyUniqueID": "UID123",
    "cp.utag_main_js": "Step1",
    "cp.utag_main_juid": null
}
```
**Outcome:**  
With the unique ID missing (set as null), only the journey step is compared. Since `JourneyStep` equals `cp.utag_main_js`, the function returns **true**.

---

### Example 4 – No Persisted Values Provided

**Input Data Layer (dl):**
```javascript
{
    "JourneyStep": "Step1",
    "JourneyUniqueID": "UID123",
    "cp.utag_main_js": null,
    "cp.utag_main_juid": null
}
```
**Outcome:**  
With neither persisted value defined, the function returns **false**.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Type Comparisons:**  
  The code checks for cp values against the string `"undefined"` and `null`. Depending on how data is initialised or passed in Tealium, there could be edge cases if an actual `undefined` value is encountered. Ensure consistency with how these values are set.

- **Duplicate Tag Logic:**  
  The extension assumes that if only `journey_step_cp` is available (and the persisted unique ID is missing), the determination of a duplicate load is solely based on the journey step. This may not be sufficient if uniqueness of the journey is critical.

- **Dependence on Data Layer Integrity:**  
  The extension does not include defensive coding against malformed or unexpected data. The data layer values are expected to be present and correctly formatted.

- **Conflict Considerations:**  
  If other Tealium iQ extensions manipulate or rely on the same data layer keys (`JourneyStep`, `JourneyUniqueID`, `cp.utag_main_js`, `cp.utag_main_juid`), there may be unintended conflicts.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Enhanced Type Checking:**  
  Consider using stricter checks for undefined values. For example, checking against actual `undefined` (using typeof or similar methods) might be more robust than comparing to the string `"undefined"`.  
  *Note: As ES5 is required, use standard JavaScript property checks.*

- **Modularisation of Logic:**  
  Extract the comparison logic into smaller helper functions. This could improve readability and testability.

- **Code Comments and Logging:**  
  While console logs have been removed, it might be useful to include conditional logging (perhaps based on an environment flag) for easier debugging during maintenance phases.

- **Consistent Naming Conventions:**  
  The variable names (e.g. `journey_step_cp`) are clear, but ensuring consistency in naming can further improve code readability.

- **Unit Testing:**  
  Develop unit tests to cover all branches of the logic—including when cp values are missing, matching, or mismatched—to ensure robust behaviour under all expected conditions.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Review:**  
  Developers should review this extension periodically, especially when changes are made to the data layer structure or when integrating with other Tealium iQ extensions.

- **Ownership:**  
  Designate a primary maintainer or team responsible for monitoring the extension’s performance and implementing best practices.

- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  Ensure thorough testing across different browsers and scenarios where the data layer values might vary. Automated tests should be in place for regression testing.

- **Documentation Updates:**  
  Any changes to the logic or structure of the extension should be accompanied by updates to this documentation to keep all stakeholders informed.

- **Versioning:**  
  Note the current version (v1.2.8) and log updates in version control comments to track changes and improvements over time.

This documentation aims to provide a clear, detailed overview of how the extension works, its intended usage scenarios, and best practices for maintenance and refactoring. Keeping the documentation updated as the codebase evolves is key to ensuring smooth operations and knowledge transfer across teams.
