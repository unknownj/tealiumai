# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation

## 1. Extension Overview
- **Name**: Sampled Mappings of Foreign Keys
- **ID**: 1557
- **Type**: Advanced Javascript Code
- **Scope**: 928
- **Execution Frequency**: 1/100 sample basis

### Summary
This extension is designed to conditionally populate certain properties in the Tealium data layer based on a random sampling method. Specifically, it maps the section IDs and target properties for a select subset of events (1% of total events). This selective approach helps in mitigating data noise while still capturing relevant data for analytics.

## 2. Code Explanation
### Key Variables
- `a`, `b`, `u`: The parameters representing the event type, event payload, and tag object, respectively. 
- `Math.random()`: A built-in JavaScript function used to generate a random floating-point number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive).

### Logic Flow
1. **Sampling Condition**: The extension uses a random number generation method to determine whether to execute the mapping logic. Specifically, it checks if the random number (multiplied by 100) equals 0 (`Math.floor(100 * Math.random()) === 0`). This results in a 1% chance of executing the following mappings:
   - `u.map.SectionID` is set to `"prop46"`
   - `u.map.TargetProperty` is set to `"prop47"`
   - `u.map.GA360Page` is set to `"prop49"`

2. **Data Mapping**: When the condition is met, the specified properties in the `u.map` object will be populated with the defined string literals.

### Dependencies
- The script relies on the global object `u`, which is an integral part of Tealium's data layer.
- There are no other external libraries or global variables in use.

## 3. Usage Examples
### Normal Condition
When events are triggered, if the random condition evaluates to true (1/100 chance):
- **Input**: Any event that reaches this extension.
- **Output**: 
  - `u.map.SectionID` becomes `"prop46"`
  - `u.map.TargetProperty` becomes `"prop47"`
  - `u.map.GA360Page` becomes `"prop49"`

### Edge Condition
If the random condition evaluates to false (99/100 chance):
- **Input**: Any event that reaches this extension.
- **Output**: The properties in `u.map` remain unchanged; no new mappings are created.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas
- **Sampling Bias**: The 1% sampling can lead to skewed data, particularly if the events triggered are not uniformly distributed over time.
- **Consistency in Property Mapping**: Because the mapping occurs conditionally, the values in `u.map` may not be present during every event, leading to inconsistent data inputs in downstream analytics.
- **Potential Conflicts**: If other extensions attempt to manipulate the same `u.map` properties, conflicts may arise leading to unexpected results.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring
- **Modularization**: Instead of embedding the logic directly in the main function, consider abstracting the mapping logic into its own function. This would enhance readability and maintainability.
  
  ```javascript
  function sampleMapping() {
      u.map.SectionID = "prop46";
      u.map.TargetProperty = "prop47";
      u.map.GA360Page = "prop49";
  }
  
  if (Math.floor(100 * Math.random()) === 0) {
      sampleMapping();
  }
  ```

- **Code Style**: Ensure consistent use of indentation and line breaks to improve readability.
- **Documentation**: Commenting key sections in the code can provide clarity for future developers regarding the sampling logic and data flows.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes
- **Ownership**: Assign an individual or a team responsible for the upkeep of this extension to ensure it is reviewed periodically.
- **Testing Guidelines**: Implement a strategy to test this extension under various conditions, focusing particularly on the random sampling logic to confirm data consistency.
- **Ongoing Maintenance**: Schedule regular code reviews to assess the performance of the sampling and ensure adherence to best practices in data handling.
