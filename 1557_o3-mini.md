# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: Sampled Mappings of Foreign Keys

This document provides an in-depth overview of the "Sampled Mappings of Foreign Keys" extension deployed within Tealium iQ. It covers the extension's configuration details, code logic, usage scenarios, limitations, refactoring recommendations, and maintenance guidelines.

---

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Sampled Mappings of Foreign Keys  
- **Extension ID:** 100040 (internal id: 1557)  
- **Type:** Advanced Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** 928  
- **Execution Frequency:** The extension executes on every relevant event; however, its core functionality (mapping manipulation) is applied only on a one-in-one-hundred (1/100) sampling basis.

**Summary:**  
This extension randomly selects approximately 1% of incoming events (using a Math.random-based sampling mechanism) and, for those events, assigns specific string values to properties in the global mapping object (u.map). The purpose is to conditionally process and map foreign keys based on sampled events, which might be useful for controlled testing, data validation, or staged deployment of mapping configurations.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables & Parameters
- **Input Parameters:**  
  - `a` (alias for eventType): A string representing the event type.  
  - `b` (alias for eventPayload): An object containing event-related data.  
  - `u` (alias for tagObject): The Tealium tag object, which is expected to have a `map` property for assigning mapping values.

- **Global Objects:**  
  - `u`: A globally available object provided by Tealium that includes the mapping structure u.map.

### Logic Flow
1. **Sampling Mechanism:**  
   - The code multiplies a random number between 0 and 1 by 100, floors the result to obtain an integer between 0 and 99, and checks if that integer equals 0. Effectively, this provides a sampling rate of approximately 1%.

2. **Conditional Mapping Assignment:**  
   - If the random number check passes (i.e. the event is selected by the sampling mechanism), the code assigns specific string (property) values to keys within `u.map`. The assignments are:
     - `u.map.SectionID` is set to `"prop46"`.
     - `u.map.TargetProperty` is set to `"prop47"`.
     - `u.map.GA360Page` is set to `"prop49"`.
   - There is also a commented out line for `PegasusTagName` which suggests that there might be plans to incorporate an additional mapping (`u.map.PegasusTagName = "prop48"`) in future implementations or testing scenarios.

### Dependencies
- **Global Object Dependency:**  
  - The extension relies on the global object `u` being available and having a `map` property for the assignments.  
- **Random Number Generation:**  
  - The extension uses the native JavaScript `Math.random()` function and `Math.floor()` to determine the sampling outcome.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Operation
- **Scenario:** A typical data event is processed.  
  - On receiving an event, the extension executes and generates a random number. If the generated number is 0, the mapping values for `SectionID`, `TargetProperty`, and `GA360Page` within `u.map` are updated.  
  - **Example Event:**  
    - Event Type: "link_click"  
    - Event Payload: { url: "https://example.com" }  
  - **Behaviour:** With a probability of 1%, the mapping values are set as described. With a probability of 99%, no changes occur.

### Edge Conditions
- **High Volume of Events:**  
  - In scenarios with a very high volume of events, a small fraction (roughly 1%) will experience the mapping updates. This may be used to monitor or log specific mappings for a subset of data.
- **Testing Adjustments:**  
  - For testing purposes, developers may temporarily adjust the sampling condition (e.g. change the comparison from === 0 to another value) to simulate the mapping assignment on a broader or narrower set of events.

### Behaviour with Commented Code
- The commented mapping assignment for `PegasusTagName` indicates a potential future enhancement. Users should note that this mapping is not currently applied, and its absence may affect downstream processing if other components expect this property.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Low Sampling Frequency:**  
  - Only 1 in every 100 events will trigger the mapping update. In environments with low traffic, this might mean very few events actually undergo the mapping change, which could affect statistical validity if used for analysis.
  
- **Potential Conflicts:**  
  - If other Tealium extensions or external scripts also modify properties of `u.map`, there may be unintended overwrites or conflict. Coordination among extensions is recommended.
  
- **Commented Code:**  
  - The presence of commented out code (i.e. `PegasusTagName`) could be misleading. Developers must ensure that any future changes align with the intended data mappings across the team.
  
- **Dependency on Global Object:**  
  - The code assumes that the global object `u` is always available and correctly initialised. If another extension or script modifies `u`, unexpected behaviour may occur.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Extract the Sampling Rate:**  
  - Define the sampling rate (e.g. 1 in 100) as a configurable variable. This would simplify future modifications to the sampling frequency.
    - Example (ES5 compliant):
      var sampleRate = 100;
      if (Math.floor(sampleRate * Math.random()) === 0) { â€¦ }
  
- **Modularise the Mapping Logic:**  
  - Consider isolating the mapping logic into a separate function. This would improve readability and maintainability.
    - Example:
      function assignMappings(map) {
        map.SectionID = "prop46";
        map.TargetProperty = "prop47";
        // map.PegasusTagName = "prop48"; // Future consideration
        map.GA360Page = "prop49";
      }
      if (Math.floor(100 * Math.random()) === 0) {
        assignMappings(u.map);
      }
  
- **Improve Comment Clarity:**  
  - Update comments to clearly explain the purpose of each mapping and the rationale behind the sampling. Ensure that any disabled (commented) code is accompanied by a note explaining why it is not currently active.

- **Maintain ES5 Compatibility:**  
  - Although refactoring suggestions may sometimes tempt ES6 features, continue to use ES5 constructs such as var for variable declarations and traditional function syntax to ensure compatibility.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Regularly test the extension in a staging environment to ensure that the sampling logic and mapping assignments behave as expected. Automated tests should simulate both the sampled condition (when the random check passes) and the default condition.
  
- **Ownership & Versioning:**  
  - Maintain revision history and document any changes to the sampling rate or mapping logic clearly within version control. Assign a responsible team/individual to monitor the extension's performance and compatibility with other changes in the Tealium environment.
  
- **Ongoing Monitoring:**  
  - Monitor for any conflicts with other extensions that might modify the same mapping properties (`SectionID`, `TargetProperty`, etc.). Establish a protocol for resolving conflicts.
  
- **Future Enhancements:**  
  - If the commented out mapping (e.g. `PegasusTagName`) becomes necessary, ensure that support for it is planned in coordination with other teams relying on this data. Documentation should be updated accordingly.
  
- **Code Reviews:**  
  - Regularly review this extension during code reviews to ensure adherence to best practices and proper functioning within the broader tracking and analytics solution.
