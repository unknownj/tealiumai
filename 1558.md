# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: Disable Adobe on NFT Domain

## 1. Extension Overview
- **Name**: Disable Adobe on NFT Domain
- **ID**: 1558
- **Type**: Advanced JavaScript Code
- **Scope**: 928
- **Execution Frequency**: On each event trigger

### Summary
This extension is designed to disable Adobe Analytics tracking for users visiting the specified domain (`business-nft.test.lloydsbank.co.uk`). It aims to prevent data collection during stress-testing scenarios while providing a clear console message indicating that tracking has been disabled.

---

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- `window.location.hostname`: Used to determine the current domain name of the user's browser.
  
### Logic Flow
1. The code begins by checking the current hostname of the browser.
2. If the hostname matches `business-nft.test.lloydsbank.co.uk`, it logs a message to the console alerting the user that Adobe Analytics tracking is disabled.
3. The function then returns `false`, effectively negating any Adobe Analytics tagging that would normally occur.

### Dependencies
- The code relies on the global `window` object to obtain the current hostname.
- No external libraries are used or required for the execution of this code.

---

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Condition
- When a user accesses the domain `business-nft.test.lloydsbank.co.uk`, the console will output:
  ```
  Adobe Analytics disabled until you stop running stress tests on this domain
  ```
- Adobe Analytics tracking will not be executed.

### Edge Condition
- If a user accesses any other domain, the code's conditional statement will not execute, and Adobe Analytics tracking defaults to the normal behaviour, allowing data to flow as intended.

---

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas
- **Domain-Specific Execution**: The extension will only function for the specified domain. If the code is deployed in a different environment or domain where tracking is needed, it will inadvertently disable Adobe Analytics, potentially leading to data loss.
- **Integration Conflicts**: If other extensions or scripts interfere with the Adobe Analytics tracking, unexpected behaviours may occur, particularly if multiple scripts are conditionally disabling or modifying tracking logic.

---

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring
- **Code Modularity**: Consider wrapping the functionality in a named function rather than an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) to improve readability and allow for better testing.
- **Enhanced Logging**: Including console logs for different contexts (e.g. where tracking is enabled) could aid in debugging.
- **Preventative Checks**: Although we are required to support ES5, ensuring that `window.location` is defined before accessing `hostname` protects against potential future environmental changes.

---

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes
- **Ownership**: Designate a responsible party for ongoing updates or reviewing the extension, especially as testing environments change.
- **Testing Guidelines**: Regularly test the extension in its intended environment to ensure that it continues to function as expected across updates to the Tealium iQ system or changes to domain configurations.
- **Documentation Updates**: Maintain the documentation to reflect any changes made to the extension's logic or domain specifications to ensure clarity for future developers.
