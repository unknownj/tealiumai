# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the "Disable Adobe on NFT Domain" extension for Tealium iQ. It covers an explanation of the code, usage scenarios, limitations, recommendations, and maintenance guidelines.

---

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Disable Adobe on NFT Domain  
- **ID:** 1558 (Extension instance), 100040 (Extension definition)  
- **Type:** Advanced Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** 928  
- **Execution Frequency:** The extension executes when a specific tag is fired (per its association in Tealium), making it conditional rather than on every event; it specifically skips Adobe Analytics on stress test domains.

**Summary:**  
This extension disables Adobe Analytics on the domain "business-nft.test.lloydsbank.co.uk". When the page is loaded on this NFT test domain, the script logs a message to the console indicating that Adobe Analytics is disabled, then prevents further execution (by returning false). The intention is to avoid running Adobe Analytics on a domain that is used for stress tests.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables & Parameters:
- **eventType:**  
  Passed as the first parameter. Although not utilised in the code, it is available if needed for further processing.
  
- **eventPayload:**  
  Passed as the second parameter. Similar to eventType, it is not actively used in this code.
  
- **tagObject:**  
  The third parameter which is available for further tag-specific operations, but it remains unused in the current logic.

### Logic Flow:
1. **Self-Executing Function:**  
   The code is wrapped inside an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) that accepts three parameters: eventType, eventPayload, and tagObject. This ensures that the variables do not leak into the global scope.

2. **Hostname Check:**  
   The script checks if the current window's hostname equals "business-nft.test.lloydsbank.co.uk". This evaluation uses the global object `window.location.hostname`.

3. **Console Logging:**  
   If the domain matches, a message is logged to the browser console:
   > "Adobe Analytics disabled until you stop running stress tests on this domain"

4. **Disabling Analytics:**  
   The function returns `false` after logging. This return value can be interpreted by the calling function or Tealium's tag sequencing to stop further processing or firing of Adobe Analytics tags on this domain.

### Dependencies:
- **Global Object Dependency:**  
  The code depends on the presence of `window.location` and assumes that the environment is a browser. It also uses `console.log` for logging, which is available in modern browsers.
  
- **Tealium Variables:**  
  The code expects `eventType`, `eventPayload`, and `tagObject` to be supplied by the Tealium iQ environment. No additional libraries are required.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Flow (Non-NFT Domain):
- **Scenario:**  
  A user visits a non-NFT domain, such as "www.lloydsbank.co.uk".
- **Data Flow:**  
  1. The IIFE is executed.
  2. The hostname does not match "business-nft.test.lloydsbank.co.uk".
  3. The condition fails; no logging occurs and the script completes without returning `false`.
  4. Adobe Analytics analytics proceed as scheduled.

### Edge Condition (NFT Domain):
- **Scenario:**  
  A user navigates to "business-nft.test.lloydsbank.co.uk" during stress tests.
- **Data Flow:**  
  1. The IIFE is executed.
  2. The hostname check matches.
  3. A console message is output: "Adobe Analytics disabled until you stop running stress tests on this domain".
  4. The function returns `false`, thereby stopping any subsequent Adobe Analytics tag from firing on the NFT domain.

### Data Inputs & Outputs:
- **Input:**  
  No additional input data is processed. The extension solely relies on the browser's hostname.
- **Output:**  
  The script logs a message to the console and prevents further execution of Adobe Analytics when conditions are met.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Domain Hardcoding:**  
  The extension is hardcoded to the domain "business-nft.test.lloydsbank.co.uk". Any change to this domain requires an update in the code.

- **Limited Scope of Action:**  
  The code only prevents Adobe Analytics from firing. It does not handle or disable any other tags or third-party integrations which might also be affected by stress tests.

- **Console Dependency:**  
  Logging is done solely via `console.log`. In environments with disabled console logging or non-browser environments, the message may not be visible.

- **Execution Context Assumption:**  
  The extension assumes it is running in a browser environment where `window` is defined. If run in a non-standard environment, errors may occur due to missing global objects.

- **Potential Script Conflicts:**  
  If other Tealium extensions or external scripts also manage analytics flows or alter the `window.location.hostname` before this extension executes, there could be unexpected behaviours.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks:**  
  Although defensive coding for the existence of `eventType` and `eventPayload` is not required, consider adding defensive checks for `window` and `window.location` to gracefully handle rare execution environments, if applicable.

- **Modularisation:**  
  Encapsulate the domain check and logging into smaller functions if additional logic is anticipated in future extensions, facilitating easier unit testing.

- **Parameterisation:**  
  Consider externalising the domain value (i.e. "business-nft.test.lloydsbank.co.uk") to a variable or configuration object. This approach would make future domain changes more manageable without altering the code logic.

- **Commenting & Documentation:**  
  Add inline comments explaining the purpose of the condition and the implications of returning `false`, ensuring other developers understand the intended effect.

- **Simplicity:**  
  The code is simple and performs one specific check. If future functionalities are added, consider using a switch-case block or similar control structures for better readability.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**
  - Regularly review the domain list and ensure that the logic aligns with the current stress testing practices.
  - Monitor Tealium's documentation for any changes in how extensions are executed that might affect this custom extension.

- **Ownership:**
  - Designate an owner or a team responsible for updates to the extension, ensuring that changes in testing practices or domain usage are reflected promptly.

- **Testing Guidelines:**
  - Include unit tests or integration tests that simulate navigation from various domains.
  - Verify through browser console logs that the appropriate messages are logged only when on the NFT domain.
  - Test in a staging environment where Tealium extensions are previewed before deploying to production.

- **Documentation Updates:**
  - Maintain this documentation in a central repository (e.g. as part of the projectâ€™s GitHub wiki or documentation folder).
  - Update the documentation whenever changes are made to the extension's logic or configuration.
