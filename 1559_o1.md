# Show and Hide Extension Documentation

Below is a comprehensive documentation page detailing the **Show and Hide** Tealium iQ extension. This page is intended to help developers and stakeholders understand how this extension is structured, how it works, and how it can be maintained or improved.

---

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name**: Show and Hide  
- **ID**: 1559  
- **Type**: Advanced JavaScript Code  
- **Scope**: DOM Ready  
- **Execution Frequency**: Run Once  

### Summary

The **Show and Hide** extension manages conditional page registration for analytics tracking. It uses a global object (`LBGAnalytics`) to detect whether certain page criteria (`Q` function checks against the “CanonicalPath” or other conditions) are met, sets data in the analytics data layer, and optionally fires analytics events (e.g., `pageView`). It also attaches click handlers to specific DOM elements (`[data-show-elements]` or other selectors) so that user interaction triggers data-layer updates and/or analytics events. Effectively, the extension provides a straightforward way to:

- Register page states or sections with user-defined criteria.  
- Update the data layer based on page sections shown or hidden.  
- Send analytics events conditionally when those sections are revealed or interacted with.

---

## 2. Code Explanation

The extension sets up a global namespacing object:

```js
LBGAnalytics.showHide = LBGAnalytics.showHide || { handlers: [] };
```

This object stores a list of “handlers.” Each handler represents a condition under which data should be set in the data layer and (optionally) an event triggered. The primary function is:

```js
LBGAnalytics.showHide.registerPage = function(criteria, selector, data, send) {
    var $ = LBGAnalytics.$;
    var Q = LBGAnalytics.Q;

    // Check if the page meets the specified criteria
    if (Q(criteria)) {

        // Add a new entry to the handlers array
        var thisIndex = LBGAnalytics.showHide.handlers.push({
            criteria: criteria,
            selector: selector,
            data: data,
            send: send,
            invocations: 0
        }) - 1;

        // If no selector is provided, automatically set data and optionally send a pageView event
        if (!selector) {
            LBGAnalytics.datalayer.set(data, true);
            if (send) {
                LBGAnalytics.events.pageView().send();
            }
            LBGAnalytics.showHide.handlers[thisIndex].invocations += 1;
        }

        // If a selector is provided, attach a click handler to set data and optionally send the event
        if (selector) {
            $(selector).click(function() {
                LBGAnalytics.datalayer.set(data, true);
                if (send) {
                    LBGAnalytics.events.pageView().send();
                }
                LBGAnalytics.showHide.handlers[thisIndex].invocations += 1;
            });
        }
    }
};
```

#### Key Variables and Functions

- **`criteria`** (String): A text condition checked by `LBGAnalytics.Q()`. Commonly of the form `"CanonicalPath contains <someValue>"`, used to decide if the data-layer logic should run on the current page.  
- **`selector`** (String): A CSS selector (e.g., `"[data-show-elements*=some-value]"`) to which a click event is bound. If `false` or `null`, the data-layer logic executes immediately on page load.  
- **`data`** (Object): An object containing key-value pairs to be set into the data layer.  
- **`send`** (Boolean): If `true`, invokes `LBGAnalytics.events.pageView().send()` to track an analytics event after data-layer updates occur.  

#### Logic Flow

1. **Criteria Check**: The extension checks the `Q(criteria)` function. If it returns `true`, the current page meets the condition.  
2. **Handler Registration**: A handler object (criteria, selector, data, etc.) is pushed onto an internal array (`LBGAnalytics.showHide.handlers`).  
3. **Immediate Execution**: If `selector` is falsy, the data layer is updated immediately when the condition is met, and `send` may trigger a `pageView` event.  
4. **Click Handler**: If `selector` exists, it attaches a click event to all matching elements in the DOM, updating the data layer and optionally sending a `pageView` event each time.  

#### Dependencies

- **`LBGAnalytics`** (Global): Must already be defined. Provides:  
  - `LBGAnalytics.$`: A jQuery-like or jQuery-wrapped object for DOM operations.  
  - `LBGAnalytics.Q(criteria)`: A function to check if the current page matches certain text-based conditions.  
  - `LBGAnalytics.datalayer`: An object exposed to set or retrieve data (e.g., `datalayer.set()` calls).  
  - `LBGAnalytics.events`: An object with event methods like `pageView()` or `fieldUpdate()`.  
- **`Q(condition_string)`**: Custom logic that checks for text matches in something like the current page path.  
- **`$`** (jQuery or jQuery-like): Used for querying and attaching click event handlers to DOM elements.

## 3. Usage Examples

Below are a few scenarios showing how data updates flow through the extension.

### Example A: Setting Data on Page Load Without a Selector

```js
LBGAnalytics.showHide.registerPage(
  "CanonicalPath contains /pensions-transfer/application.html",
  false,
  {
    JourneyName: "Retail New RA Application",
    JourneyStep: 0,
    JourneyStepName: "Taking Money From Pension",
    ApplicationState: "Application",
    JourneyProduct: "Retail Retirement Account"
  },
  true
);
```

- **Criteria**: If the page URL path contains `/pensions-transfer/application.html`.  
- **Selector**: `false`. No user interaction is required; immediately sets data.  
- **Data**: Keys like `JourneyName`, `JourneyStep`, `JourneyProduct` are applied to the analytics data layer.  
- **Send**: `true`. This triggers a `pageView` event once data are set.

### Example B: Attaching Click Handlers to Update Data

```js
LBGAnalytics.showHide.registerPage(
  "CanonicalPath contains /overpayment-calculator.html",
  "[data-show-elements*=overpayment-yes]",
  {
    JourneyStep: 1,
    JourneyStepName: "Mortgage Term has Ended",
    JourneyAction: "Referred to Telephony",
    JourneyActionNarrative: "Term has Expired",
    ApplicationState: "Referred"
  },
  true
);
```

- **Criteria**: `Q("CanonicalPath contains /overpayment-calculator.html")`.  
- **Selector**: `"[data-show-elements*=overpayment-yes]"`. When users click on elements matching this selector on an eligible page:  
  - The data layer is updated with the specified journey details.  
  - A `pageView` event is optionally fired.

### Example C: Parsing DOM Contents for Dynamic Values

```js
if (LBGAnalytics.Q("CanonicalPath contains forms/pension-transfer-swws")) {
  LBGAnalytics.datalayer.set("OtherCustomerID", function() {
    return LBGAnalytics.$("[scep-template]")
      .text()
      .split('Plan No:')[1]
      .split('Pension credits')[0]
      .replace(/\s/g, '');
  }, true);
}
```

- **Automated Parsing**: Dynamically extracts a plan number from the DOM text and sets it into `OtherCustomerID`.  
- **Condition**: Only runs on pages containing `forms/pension-transfer-swws` in their path.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

1. **Dependency on `LBGAnalytics`**: This code requires `LBGAnalytics`, including `LBGAnalytics.$` and `LBGAnalytics.Q`, to be available and properly initialised before the extension runs. If these are missing or delayed, the extension will fail.  
2. **Page Content Changes After DOM Ready**: The extension reads/attaches click handlers on DOM Ready. If elements are added/removed dynamically after that, those elements may not have the click handlers or relevant data assignments.  
3. **Text Parsing Reliability**: Parsing strings from the DOM (e.g., “Plan No: … Pension credits …”) assumes fixed text structure. Changes in content or formatting may cause errors or missing data.  
4. **Multiple Registrations**: If the same criteria/selector pair is registered multiple times, data-layer updates or event firings might happen repeatedly. Carefully deduplicate if necessary.  
5. **Performance Overhead**: Registering a large number of page checks and click handlers can introduce a performance overhead if many pages or elements are monitored.  

---

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

1. **Consolidate Repetitive Calls**  
   - A single array of registration objects could be used, iterated over with a loop for each “registerPage” call. This would avoid numerous repetitive lines.  

2. **Break Down Into Reusable Functions**  
   - The parsing logic that extracts data from DOM text (e.g., plan numbers) could be refactored to a utility function shared by all relevant conditions, reducing duplication of string-splitting logic.  

3. **Improve Error Handling**  
   - Before parsing text in complicated ways, the code could verify the expected strings exist. If they do not, gracefully skip or log a warning rather than risking undefined behaviour.  

4. **Group Criteria**  
   - Common criteria checks such as `"CanonicalPath contains forms/pension-transfer"` appear in multiple places. You could store these strings in variables or map them to a set of journeys to reduce copy-paste errors.  

5. **Maintain ES5 Compatibility**  
   - While modern JavaScript provides features (e.g., `let`, `const`, arrow functions) that can improve readability, the extension must remain ES5-compatible. Continue using `var` and regular function expressions as required.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ownership & Updates**: Given this extension’s broad coverage of different pages and journeys, it should be owned by a team responsible for the overall analytics data layer and event tracking.  
- **Testing Guidelines**:  
  1. **Regular Regression**: Whenever site content or page URLs change, re-test the logic using the new “canonical path” or elements.  
  2. **Data Validation**: Ensure that data-layer variables (like `JourneyName`, `JourneyAmount`) are set properly and appear in the correct analytics tool.  
  3. **Cross-Page Consistency**: Confirm that any pages sharing criteria do not conflict.  
  4. **Edge Cases**: Any form that might not have the expected text structure or hidden DOM elements should be tested to avoid exceptions.  
- **Version Control**: Keep this extension code in a shared repository (e.g., GitHub) and track changes to ensure multiple developers can collaborate safely.  
- **Document Changes**: Incrementally update the extension notes and references if new forms or journeys get added so that future updates do not lead to duplication or loss of coverage.
