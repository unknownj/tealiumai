## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Show and Hide  
- **Extension ID:** 100040  
- **Type:** Advanced Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** DOM Ready  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Once  

**Summary:**  
The "Show and Hide" extension is designed to control the display of specific elements on pages by registering event handlers based on URL criteria and CSS selectors. It allows dynamic data-layer updates and event triggers (such as page views) within customer journeys. The extension supports multiple scenarios including different types of pension forms, mortgage overpayment scenarios, savings calculators, and referral forms, ensuring that relevant analytics data is updated as users interact with the page elements.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables and Global Objects
- **LBGAnalytics:** The main global object that provides utilities (such as query detection and jQuery alias) and methods to set data in the data layer and send page views or field updates.
- **LBGAnalytics.showHide:** A sub-object created (or extended) to manage a list of registered event handlers (`handlers`) and to encapsulate the `registerPage` function.
- **LBGAnalytics.$:** Alias for jQuery (or similar DOM manipulation library) provided through LBGAnalytics.
- **LBGAnalytics.Q:** Utility function which checks whether the current page matches a given criterion (e.g., a URL pattern).
- **LBGAnalytics.datalayer:** Object used to set data into the analytics data layer, possibly to drive further tracking or reporting.
- **LBGAnalytics.events:** Contains methods such as `pageView()` and `fieldUpdate(...)` which are used to send analytics calls.

### Core Logic – Function: registerPage
- **Function Signature:**  
  `LBGAnalytics.showHide.registerPage(criteria, selector, data, send)`

- **Parameters:**  
  - `criteria`: A string used by the `LBGAnalytics.Q` method to determine if the extension should run its logic (e.g., "CanonicalPath contains ...").
  - `selector`: A CSS selector targeting elements on the page. If `false`, indicates a data layer update that takes place immediately rather than on user interaction.
  - `data`: An object containing key/value pairs (representing analytics data, e.g., JourneyStep, JourneyName) that is merged into the data layer when the criteria is met.
  - `send`: A Boolean that dictates whether a page view event should be sent after updating the data layer.

- **Process Overview:**  
  - The extension first checks if the current page meets the provided criteria using `LBGAnalytics.Q(criteria)`.
  - If the criteria are met, the handler is stored in an internal array (`LBGAnalytics.showHide.handlers`) along with its associated data and a counter for tracking invocations.
  - **Immediate Data Update:**  
    If there is no selector provided (i.e. selector is `false`), the `data` is immediately set in the datalayer and, if `send` is true, a page view event is sent.
  - **Event Binding:**  
    If a selector is provided, a click event handler is attached to all matching elements. When an element is clicked:
    - The `data` is merged into the data layer.
    - If `send` is true, a page view event (or relevant action) is sent.
    - The invocation counter for that handler is incremented.
 
### Additional Logic and Conditional Blocks
- **Multiple Page Registrations:**  
  The extension registers handlers for various pages and scenarios, including:
  - Pension transfer forms (retail, SW, RA)
  - Mortgage overpayment calculator pages
  - Savings calculators for different page layouts
  - Private banking referral forms
  
- **Data Layer Functions:**  
  Apart from page registration, the code makes additional data layer updates for certain conditions (e.g., setting "OtherCustomerID" based on visible text in the DOM, setting "JourneyAmount" and "JourneyTerm" using visible element data).
  
- **Event Listeners:**  
  For some pages, the extension attaches change or click events to provide immediate feedback and to register field updates using `LBGAnalytics.events.fieldUpdate`.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Example 1 – Immediate Data Layer Update
- **Scenario:** A page URL matching "CanonicalPath contains /pensions-transfer/application.html" is loaded.
- **Operation:**  
  A handler is registered for the overall journey data without an element selector. On page load, the data object (e.g., JourneyName, JourneyStep, etc.) is immediately set on the data layer and a page view event is sent.
- **Outcome:**  
  The data layer reflects the journey start state for a "Retail New RA Application".

### Example 2 – Click-Triggered Event
- **Scenario:** The same pension application page includes an element that matches the selector "[data-show-elements*=about-you]".
- **Operation:**  
  A click event is bound to any element matching the specified selector. When the user clicks the element, the corresponding journey step data (e.g., JourneyStep: 1, JourneyStepName: "About You") is set into the data layer and a page view event is sent.
- **Outcome:**  
  Each click will update the data layer and send the page view event, incrementing the handler’s invocation count.

### Example 3 – Edge Case: No Matching Criteria
- **Scenario:** If the URL does not match any criteria specified in `LBGAnalytics.Q`, none of the registered handlers will execute.
- **Operation:**  
  The criteria check fails, and no data updates or event sends occur.
- **Outcome:**  
  No analytics data is pushed, ensuring that only relevant pages trigger the intended tracking.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Selector-Specific Limitations:**  
  If a selector does not match any elements on the page, the associated event handler is never bound. This might lead to scenarios where the intended click-triggered data updates do not occur, even if the criteria are met.

- **Multiple Registrations:**  
  The extension registers many handlers for similar conditions. If the page includes multiple elements that match overlapping selectors, there could be confusion over which handler is responsible for updating the data layer.

- **Dependency on DOM Structure and Text Content:**  
  Some data layer values (e.g., "OtherCustomerID", "JourneyAmount", "JourneyTerm") depend heavily on the presence and structure of specific DOM elements. Any changes to these elements’ structure or content (such as text splitting logic) could break the data extraction process.

- **Global Dependency:**  
  This extension relies on the LBGAnalytics global object and its associated methods (such as Q, $, datalayer, and events). Any modifications to these global methods or availability can disrupt the extension's workflow.

- **ES5 Restriction:**  
  All code is written in ES5 to ensure compatibility. This limits the use of more modern syntax that may simplify asynchronous or promise-based logic.

- **Potential Conflicts with Other Extensions:**  
  As this extension modifies the data layer and sends events immediately on page load or on interactions, overlapping logic from other Tealium or custom extensions may result in duplicate events or conflicting data-layer updates.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Coding:**  
  While eventType and eventPayload availability are guaranteed, it is advisable to include additional defensive checks for DOM element availability especially where strict text splitting is involved, to prevent runtime errors.

- **Modularisation:**  
  Consider breaking out repeated code segments (for example, attaching click events on selectors and updating handler invocation counts) into smaller, more testable functions. This can improve maintainability and readability.

- **Documentation & Commenting:**  
  Increase inline documentation to remind future developers of the logic behind string parsing and the purpose of multiple registrations. Comment blocks explaining conditional sections (such as those for different pension forms) would also be beneficial.

- **Separation of Event Binding and Data Logic:**  
  Consider separating logic that binds events from the data layer update logic. This decouples DOM interaction from the analytics data update, making the extension easier to test and maintain.

- **Code Formatting:**  
  Although adhering to ES5, establish and follow a consistent code style and naming conventions. This includes spacing, brace usage, and well-named functions to improve overall code readability.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ownership:**  
  It is recommended that the team maintaining the LBGAnalytics global object closely monitor any changes to the DOM structure or external library updates (such as jQuery). Ensure that any modifications maintain the compatibility of the extension.

- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Perform regression testing whenever updates are made to page structures or when other analytics extensions are deployed.  
  - Establish unit tests for functions that manipulate or extract data from the DOM.  
  - Use test pages with mock DOM elements to simulate various conditions, ensuring that both immediate executions and click events behave as expected.

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  A review process should be in place to validate that the criteria strings used by `LBGAnalytics.Q()` are still effective when marketing or site URLs change.  
  Regular code reviews can help detect any future dependency issues due to external library updates, and refactoring efforts should be evaluated periodically against emerging coding best practices within the constraints of ES5.

- **Documentation Updates:**  
  Keep this document updated with any changes or refactoring efforts. Include versioning notes, update dates, and reference the underlying Tealium iQ documentation if new features or methods are incorporated.
