# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name**: GA360 : Current Account : View eligible
- **ID**: 1565
- **Type**: Advanced JavaScript Code
- **Scope**: Before Load Rules
- **Execution Frequency**: Run Always

### Summary
This extension determines whether a user is eligible for tracking a subsequent page view for the "Current Accounts" product group based on specific conditions. It ensures that the user's journey step is greater than the stored journey step as long as the event type is a view event (`udo.ut.event`) and the journey event is neither a page load nor a hash change. The primary purpose is to manage and track user interactions accurately for analytical purposes.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- `product_group`: A string representing the product group, converted to lowercase and stripped of whitespace for consistency.
- `current_journey_step`: Represents the current step in the user's journey.
- `stored_journey_step`: Holds the previously stored journey step for the user from a custom property.
- `journey_step_name`: Captures the name of the current journey step.

### Logic Flow
1. **Validation**:
   - The function begins by checking if the product group is `CurrentAccounts`.
   - If valid, it further checks if `journey_step_name` and `stored_journey_step` are defined.
2. **Comparison**:
   - If both journey step values are defined, it compares the current and stored journey steps.
   - If the current journey step is greater than the stored one, it returns true, indicating eligibility for a subsequent page view. Otherwise, it returns false.
3. **Return**:
   - The function adds a property to the `b` object where the eligibility status can be accessed.

### Dependencies
- The extension depends on the global objects `eventType` and `eventPayload`, which are guaranteed to be present.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Condition
- **Input**: 
  - `udo.ut.event` = `view`
  - `udo.JourneyEvent` = `Page Load` (not eligible)
  - `cp.utag_main_js` = `2`
  - `JourneyStep` = `3`
- **Behaviour**: The function returns `false`, and no tracking occurs.

### Eligible Condition
- **Input**: 
  - `udo.ut.event` = `view`
  - `udo.JourneyEvent` = `CurrentAccounts`
  - `cp.utag_main_js` = `2`
  - `JourneyStep` = `3`
- **Behaviour**: The function returns `true`, and subsequent page views are tracked.

### Edge Condition
- **Input**: 
  - `udo.ut.event` = `view`
  - `udo.JourneyEvent` = `CurrentAccounts`
  - `cp.utag_main_js` = `undefined`
  - `JourneyStep` = `3`
- **Behaviour**: The function returns `false`, since there is no stored journey step available.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- The extension will always return `false` if `stored_journey_step` is not defined, regardless of other conditions.
- There is potential for race conditions if the stored journey step is not synchronously updated.
- If multiple instances of the extension are triggered, the eligibility logic might conflict unless managed carefully.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- Consider introducing additional comments within the code to clarify the purpose of specific checks, enhancing readability.
- Modularise the logic into smaller functions for easier maintenance, e.g., separate functions for validation and comparison.
- Implement logging for debugging purposes, allowing developers to track eligibility checks more straightforwardly.
- Validate input types explicitly to prevent unexpected behavior from malformed data.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ownership**: It is important to assign a primary owner or team responsible for the oversight of this extension.
- **Testing Guidelines**:
  - Implement unit tests that cover all logical branches within the eligibility function.
  - Regularly review the extension to ensure continued compatibility with any updates to the Tealium library.
- **Version Control**: Track changes to the extension in version control to ensure team awareness of modifications and revert if necessary.
