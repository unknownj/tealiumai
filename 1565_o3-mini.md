## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** GA360 : Current Account : View eligible  
- **ID:** 1565  
- **Extension Type:** Advanced Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** Before Load Rules  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Always  

**Summary:**  
This extension evaluates whether a page view event qualifies as an eligible "subsequent account view" within the Current Accounts product group. It specifically targets events where the Universal Tag (`ut.event`) is equal to "view" while ensuring that the `JourneyEvent` is not equal to values such as "Page Load", "PageLoad" or "Hash Change". When the conditions are met, it sets a flag (`current_account_view_eligible`) based on a comparison of current and stored journey step values. This aids in accurately tracking user progression and ensuring that only valid successive page views are marked as eligible.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables

- **dl (Data Layer Object):**
  - Represents the event payload containing properties required for processing (e.g., `ProductGroup`, `JourneyStep`, `JourneyStepName`, and a stored value referenced by `"cp.utag_main_js"`).

- **product_group:**
  - Derived from the `dl.ProductGroup` and normalised by converting to lowercase and removing whitespace. It is used to confirm if the event belongs to the "currentaccounts" group.

- **current_journey_step:**
  - The current journey step number acquired from `dl.JourneyStep` (expected to be a string holding a numeric value).

- **stored_journey_step:**
  - The stored journey step value acquired from `dl["cp.utag_main_js"]`. This represents a previously stored step, likely captured in earlier page view events.

- **journey_step_name:**
  - The name associated with the current journey step from `dl.JourneyStepName`. Its presence is used to validate if the page view event is part of an ongoing journey.

### Logic Flow

1. **Product Group Verification:**
   - The function begins by normalising `dl.ProductGroup` (to lowercase and without spaces) and checks if it strictly equals "currentaccounts". If not, the extension returns `false`.

2. **Journey Step Name Requirement:**
   - It then verifies that a journey step name (`dl.JourneyStepName`) exists. If undefined, the extension returns `false`, meaning no valid journey step is present.

3. **Stored Journey Step Validation:**
   - The presence of a stored journey step (`dl["cp.utag_main_js"]`) is then checked. If undefined, the extension logs (in comments) that the required stored value is missing and returns `false`.

4. **Comparison of Journey Steps:**
   - Provided both the current and stored journey steps are defined, the extension converts them to integers using `parseInt`. It compares these values, and if the current step is greater than the stored step, the function returns `true` to indicate an eligible subsequent view. If not, it returns `false`.

### Dependencies

- **Global Objects:**
  - The extension utilises two global objects:
    - `eventType` (passed as the first parameter `a` in the anonymous function)
    - `eventPayload` (passed as the second parameter `b`)
  - These objects are guaranteed to be present, and `b` (the event payload) contains all the required properties for conditional checking.

- **Tealium iQ Conditions:**
  - Although not directly part of the JavaScript function, the extension's execution relies on predefined conditions within Tealium iQ. These ensure that the extension is triggered only when:
    - `udo.JourneyEvent` is defined and does not equal either "Page Load", "PageLoad" or "Hash Change".
    - `udo.ProductGroup` equals "CurrentAccounts".
    - `udo.ut.event` is equal to "view".

## 3. Usage Examples

### Example 1: Normal Condition (Eligible Subsequent View)
**Data Layer Input:**
- ProductGroup: "CurrentAccounts"
- JourneyStep: "3"
- cp.utag_main_js (stored journey step): "2"
- JourneyStepName: "Account Overview"

**Process:**
- The product group is normalised to "currentaccounts".
- A valid journey step name exists.
- The stored journey step is available.
- `parseInt("3")` > `parseInt("2")` evaluates to true.
  
**Outcome:**
- The function returns `true` and sets `current_account_view_eligible` to true.

---

### Example 2: Edge Condition (Missing JourneyStepName)
**Data Layer Input:**
- ProductGroup: "CurrentAccounts"
- JourneyStep: "5"
- cp.utag_main_js (stored journey step): "4"
- JourneyStepName: undefined

**Process:**
- The product group is correct.
- Journey step name is missing.
  
**Outcome:**
- The function returns `false` and the flag is not set to eligible.

---

### Example 3: Edge Condition (Current Journey Step Not Greater)
**Data Layer Input:**
- ProductGroup: "CurrentAccounts"
- JourneyStep: "2"
- cp.utag_main_js (stored journey step): "3"
- JourneyStepName: "Account Summary"

**Process:**
- The product group is correct.
- The journey step name exists.
- The stored journey step is available.
- `parseInt("2")` is not greater than `parseInt("3")`.

**Outcome:**
- The function returns `false` indicating the view is not eligible.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Missing or Undefined Properties:**
  - If the expected properties (e.g., `dl.ProductGroup`, `dl.JourneyStep`, `dl["cp.utag_main_js"]`, `dl.JourneyStepName`) are unavailable or undefined, the function will reliably return `false` and thus mark the view as not eligible. These conditions are integral to preventing false positives.

- **Case Sensitivity and Whitespace:**
  - The normalisation of `ProductGroup` (conversion to lowercase and whitespace removal) is sensitive to the input. Any unexpected formatting issues may affect the matching process.

- **Dependency on Prior Stored Data:**
  - The reliance on the stored journey step value (`cp.utag_main_js`) makes it crucial that preceding events correctly set this value. Any error in capturing the previous journey step could lead to misclassification of the current view.

- **Potential Conflicts:**
  - If other Tealium extensions or external scripts modify the same data layer properties (especially `JourneyStep`, `JourneyStepName`, or `cp.utag_main_js`), the logical checks may provide inaccurate eligibility results.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Modularise the Logic:**
  - Consider breaking down the main function into smaller pure functions; for example, separate functions to check the product group, validate the journey step name, and compare journey steps. This can improve readability and ease debugging.
  
- **Defensive Checks:**
  - Although `eventType` and `eventPayload` are guaranteed, consider additional comments or logging to facilitate future debugging if unexpected data is encountered.
  
- **Comment Clarity:**
  - Expand on inline comments to explain the rationale behind each major logic check. Currently, commented console logs are present; consider either removing them or making them more comprehensive for debugging purposes.
  
- **Consistent Formatting:**
  - Maintain consistent code formatting throughout the script. Even though ES5 is a requirement, adhering to a standard style (indentation, naming conventions, brackets placement) will help in long-term maintenance.
  
- **Testing Improvements:**
  - Implement unit tests (within your chosen ES5 testing framework) to simulate various payload scenarios, ensuring that changes in one part of the code do not inadvertently affect the overall functionality.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Testing:**
  - Regularly test the extension with different simulated data layer inputs to ensure compatibility with changes in data schema or business logic.
  - Consider automated test scripts to simulate events and verify the eligibility flag.

- **Ownership & Change Log:**
  - Document any changes made to the extension code in a change log (version control system) to track modifications over time.
  - Assign a primary owner or maintainer who is responsible for updating the documentation and verifying the extension following any business process changes.

- **Future Enhancements:**
  - Monitor performance and error logs to identify any recurring issues related to data layer inconsistencies.
  - Regularly review the dependency on data layer properties to ensure that upstream modifications in Tealium or site implementations do not break the logic.

- **Stakeholder Communication:**
  - Share this documentation with stakeholders, including developers, QA teams, and marketing analysts, to ensure that limitations and logic flows are clearly understood.
  - Set up periodic reviews to confirm that the extension continues to fulfil its intended purpose as business needs evolve.
