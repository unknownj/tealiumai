# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: Set Eloqua Eligibility

This document details the inner workings, usage, and maintenance guidelines for the "Set Eloqua eligibility" extension implemented in Tealium iQ.

---

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Set Eloqua eligibility  
- **ID:** 1569  
- **Extension ID:** 100040  
- **Type:** Advanced Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** Before Load Rules  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Always  

### Summary

The purpose of this extension is to detect the presence of an "elqtrack" parameter in the URL query string. If the parameter is found, the extension sets a cookie ("AddEloqua=true") and modifies the tracking payload (`eventPayload`) by setting the property `TrackEmailVisit` to 1. This ensures that subsequent pages, or later processing in the same session, recognise that the user should be tracked for Eloqua email visits even if the query parameter is no longer present.

---

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables & Parameters

- **a (eventType):** A variable (passed as the first parameter) representing the event type. However, it is not used within the extension logic.
- **b (eventPayload):** The payload object that can be modified to include additional tracking flags. The extension sets the property `TrackEmailVisit` to 1 under certain conditions.
  
### Logic Flow

1. **Check URL Query String:**  
   - The code inspects `window.location.search` (i.e. the query string) and converts it to lower case.
   - It searches for the substring "elqtrack".  
   - **Condition:** If found (i.e., `indexOf("elqtrack")` returns a value >= 0):
     - A cookie is written: `"AddEloqua=true;path=/"`, making it accessible site-wide.
     - `eventPayload.TrackEmailVisit` is set to 1.
   
2. **Cookie Fallback Check:**  
   - If the "elqtrack" parameter was not present in the URL, the code checks if the cookie "AddEloqua" exists.
   - This is done by converting `document.cookie` to a string and checking for the presence of the substring "AddEloqua".
   - **Condition:** If the cookie exists, then also set `eventPayload.TrackEmailVisit` to 1.

### Global Dependencies

- **window.location:** The extension uses the global window object to access the current URL.
- **document.cookie:** Used to read and write cookies for persisting the "Eloqua eligibility" flag.
- **eventType & eventPayload:** Passed as parameters to the immediately-invoked function expression (IIFE), ensuring that the context-specific values are manipulated safely.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: URL Contains the "elqtrack" Parameter

- **Input:**  
  URL: `https://example.com?elqtrack`
  
- **Process:**  
  - The code finds "elqtrack" in the query string (ignoring case).
  - A cookie named "AddEloqua" with the value of true is created.
  - `eventPayload.TrackEmailVisit` is set to 1.

- **Output:**  
  - The user is flagged for Eloqua tracking.
  - The cookie persists across pages due to `path=/`.

### Scenario 2: Subsequent Visit without the Query Parameter

- **Input:**  
  URL: `https://example.com/page2` (without query parameter), but the cookie "AddEloqua" is still present.
  
- **Process:**  
  - The initial query string check fails.
  - The code then checks for the presence of the "AddEloqua" cookie.
  - Upon finding the cookie, it sets `eventPayload.TrackEmailVisit` to 1.

- **Output:**  
  - The tracking flag remains active, ensuring continuity of Eloqua tracking.

### Edge Conditions

- **Cookie Overwrite/Expiry Issues:**  
  - Since the cookie is set without an expiration date, it becomes a session cookie and may disappear if the session ends.
  
- **Case Insensitivity:**  
  - The check for the presence of "elqtrack" in the query string is made case-insensitive with `.toLowerCase()`. However, similar considerations are not applied for cookie values.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Cookie Management:**  
  - The cookie "AddEloqua" is set without an expiration, meaning it will only persist during the session. This may not be desirable if long-term tracking is required.

- **Global Object Dependencies:**  
  - The extension assumes the availability of `window` and `document` objects. In non-browser environments or if these are manipulated by other scripts, unexpected behaviour may occur.

- **Query String Reliance:**  
  - Detection solely based on the substring "elqtrack" may result in false positives in edge cases where the query string could contain similar text that is not intended to trigger Eloqua tracking.

- **Potential Conflicts:**  
  - Other Tealium extensions or scripts that manipulate cookies or track email visits may conflict with this extension if similar names or properties are used.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Coding and Readability:**  
  - While defensive coding for the availability of `eventType` and `eventPayload` is not required (guaranteed to be present), adding comments and breaking the code into logically separate blocks could improve clarity.
  - Adding helper functions for cookie management (for example, setting and reading cookies) would increase modularity and reduce repetition.

- **Cookie Expiry Attributes:**  
  - Depending on the tracking requirements, consider adding an expiry attribute to the cookie so that it persists beyond a single session if needed.
  
- **Enhanced Validation:**  
  - Although ES5 has its limitations, you could manually validate the query string and cookie values to avoid any potential false positives.

- **Comments and Documentation:**  
  - Adding inline comments can help future maintainers understand the purpose of each section of the code, particularly the cookie creation and retrieval process.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ownership & Versioning:**  
  - Ensure that any changes to the code are versioned under the appropriate system, and that responsibilities for maintaining the extension are clearly assigned.
  
- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Conduct comprehensive testing for both scenarios: when the "elqtrack" parameter is present and when it is absent but the cookie exists.
  - Test across different browsers to ensure cookie handling is consistent.
  - Validate that no other extensions are overriding or conflicting with the `eventPayload.TrackEmailVisit` flag.

- **Performance Considerations:**  
  - Given that the extension is set to "Run Always," it is important to periodically review the code for performance, especially if running alongside multiple other scripts.

- **Future Enhancements:**  
  - If additional tracking parameters or cookies are required in future implementations, consider refactoring the code into more modular components to handle multiple parameters and flags.
