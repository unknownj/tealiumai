# Hotfix for Commercial Onboarding PII Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive overview, explanation, usage scenarios, limitations, refactoring suggestions, and maintenance guidelines for the Tealium iQ extension "Hotfix for Commercial Onboarding PII".

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Hotfix for Commercial Onboarding PII  
- **Extension ID:** 100036  
- **Internal ID:** 1570  
- **Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** After Load Rules  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Always  

**Summary:**  
This extension is designed to sanitise potentially sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) within the data payload. It checks the values in the fields `RetailCustomerID` and `BusinessCustomerID` to determine if they contain an "@" character (suggesting an email address or similar PII). If such a character is found in either field, the extension resets the value to an empty string (""), thereby removing the email data. This is a hotfix mechanism to prevent unintended transmission of email addresses or related PII during commercial onboarding processes.

---

## 2. Code Explanation

The code is implemented as an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) and processes the event payload by modifying certain properties if they meet specific conditions.

### Key Variables and Data Flow

- **Function Parameters:**  
  - `a`: Represents the event type (provided as `eventType`).  
  - `b`: Represents the event payload object (provided as `eventPayload`).

- **Properties Processed:**  
  - `b.RetailCustomerID`  
  - `b.BusinessCustomerID`

### Logic Flow

1. **Type Check & Condition:**  
   - The code verifies that `b.RetailCustomerID` is of type `"string"`.
   - It then checks if the string contains the "@" character using `indexOf("@") > 0` (ensuring that the "@" is not at the very start).
   - If both conditions are met, `b.RetailCustomerID` is set to an empty string (`""`).

2. **Repeating for `BusinessCustomerID`:**  
   - The same type check and character search are performed on `b.BusinessCustomerID`.
   - If it meets the conditions, its value is similarly reset to an empty string.

### Global Dependencies

- **Global Objects Provided by Tealium:**  
  - `eventType` (passed as the first argument).
  - `eventPayload` (passed as the second argument).

No external libraries or modules are used. The extension operates solely on the provided parameters.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Example Scenario 1: Normal Condition

**Input Event Payload:**  
{
  RetailCustomerID: "customer@example.com",
  BusinessCustomerID: "business@example.com"
}

**Behaviour:**  
- Since both `RetailCustomerID` and `BusinessCustomerID` contain the "@" character, the extension will modify the payload to:
  
  {
    RetailCustomerID: "",
    BusinessCustomerID: ""
  }

### Example Scenario 2: Non-PII Values

**Input Event Payload:**  
{
  RetailCustomerID: "customer123",
  BusinessCustomerID: "business456"
}

**Behaviour:**  
- Neither value contains the "@" character.  
- The extension leaves both fields unchanged.

### Example Scenario 3: Mixed Values

**Input Event Payload:**  
{
  RetailCustomerID: "customer@example.com",
  BusinessCustomerID: "business456"
}

**Behaviour:**  
- `RetailCustomerID` is detected as a PII field due to the presence of "@" and is cleared.  
- `BusinessCustomerID` remains unchanged since it does not contain "@".

---

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Incomplete PII Detection:**  
  - The extension only checks for the presence of the "@" character to identify PII.  
  - It may not catch other forms of PII (e.g. phone numbers or names if sensitive).

- **Position of "@" Check:**  
  - The condition uses `indexOf("@") > 0` which will not clear a field if "@" appears at the first position (index 0).  
  - This might be intentional, but if an email starts with "@", it will not be caught.

- **Potential Conflicts:**  
  - If other Tealium iQ extensions or external scripts are also modifying `RetailCustomerID` or `BusinessCustomerID` fields, the order of execution may affect data integrity.  
  - Special care should be taken to ensure that this hotfix extension executes after any Load Rules and before data is transmitted to external services.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Consolidate Duplicate Code:**  
  - Consider creating a helper function to perform the common check for the "@" character and assignment to avoid repetition.

- **Enhanced Logging (If Applicable):**  
  - In a debug or development mode, add logging to capture when and why a value was reset for easier debugging.

- **Refactor for Readability:**  
  - Introduce local variables to improve clarity, e.g., store the field value before checking conditions.

- **Modularisation:**  
  - If there is potential for additional PII fields to be checked in the future, structure the code to abstract the condition-checking logic, which could be reused with minimal changes.

*Note:* All suggested refactoring should remain compliant with ES5 to meet the project requirements, avoiding ES2015/ES6 features such as arrow functions, template literals, or block-scoped declarations (`let`/`const`).

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  - Regularly review the extension for compatibility with any changes in the data structure or regulatory requirements related to PII.
  - As part of continuous improvement, incorporate feedback from stakeholders regarding new sources of PII.

- **Ownership:**  
  - Clearly assign a team or individual as the owner for updates, monitoring, and troubleshooting of this extension.

- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Develop unit tests to simulate various payload conditions (including edge cases) to ensure that the extension behaves as expected.
  - Include tests for payloads where the targeted properties are undefined, not strings, or contain the "@" character in different positions.  
  - Ensure integration tests are run as part of the release process to verify that interactions with other Tealium iQ extensions do not adversely affect the hotfix.

- **Documentation Updates:**  
  - Maintain version control of the documentation alongside the extension code so that any changes in functionality are reflected in the supporting documents.
  - Add comments in the code where necessary, particularly if additional logic is introduced in future iterations.
