# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Tealium iQ extension "Clean up upgrade link account nicknames". It covers the extension’s configuration, code logic, usage examples, known limitations, recommendations for refactoring, and maintenance guidelines.

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Clean up upgrade link account nicknames  
- **ID:** 1572 (with extensionId 100040)  
- **Type:** Advanced Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** After Load Rules  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Always  

**Summary:**  
This extension is designed to standardise the formatting of certain URL-like strings within the event payload. It specifically targets keys such as `LinkValue` and `WTP:WT.ac` within a payload that may contain a substring ",upgrade account". The extension cleans up the data by extracting the first two segments of the string (using the "/" delimiter) and then appending a fixed suffix `"/CHQ,upgrade account"`. This ensures that the account nicknames follow a predetermined structure for consistency within the data layer.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables & Global Objects

- **eventType, eventPayload:**  
  These are the parameters of the IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) that represent the current event type and the payload object respectively.  
  – Note: The code assumes that `eventType` is a string and `eventPayload` is an object, with no defensive coding needed regarding their presence.

- **b:**  
  In the function, `b` is an alias for `eventPayload`. It is used to access and modify properties of the payload object.

### Logic Flow

1. **Validation for "LinkValue":**
   - The code checks if the `LinkValue` property in `b` exists and is of type string.
   - It converts the string to lowercase and checks if it contains the substring ",upgrade account" starting at any position greater than 0.  
   - If the condition is met:
     - The string is split using the delimiter "/" into an array.
     - The first two segments of the array are extracted using `splice(0,2)`.
     - These segments are then joined with "/" and concatenated with the suffix `"/CHQ,upgrade account"`.
     - The modified string is reassigned to `b.LinkValue`.

2. **Validation for "WTP:WT.ac":**
   - Similar checks are performed on the `WTP:WT.ac` property.
   - If its string value contains ",upgrade account" (case insensitive) and meets the condition:
     - The string value is split into an array by "/".
     - The first two segments are used to reconstruct the URL-like string.
     - The fixed suffix `"/CHQ,upgrade account"` is appended to the newly formed string.
     - The property `b["WTP:WT.ac"]` is updated with this new value.

### Dependencies

- **Global objects:**  
  The code references a global variable `b` which is deliberately provided to alias `eventPayload`. It assumes that all necessary properties exist on this object under certain conditions.
- No external libraries are involved; it utilises standard ES5 methods such as `split()`, `splice()`, and `join()`.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Example 1: Normal Scenario

**Input Payload:**

{
  "LinkValue": "site/page,upgrade account",
  "WTP:WT.ac": "site/page,upgrade account"
}

**Process:**
- For `LinkValue`:  
  The string `"site/page,upgrade account"` is split into `["site", "page,upgrade account"]`.  
  The first two elements are joined to form `"site/page"`, and then `"/CHQ,upgrade account"` is concatenated resulting in `"site/page/CHQ,upgrade account"`.

- For `WTP:WT.ac`:  
  The same transformation is applied, leading to `"site/page/CHQ,upgrade account"`.

**Output Payload:**

{
  "LinkValue": "site/page/CHQ,upgrade account",
  "WTP:WT.ac": "site/page/CHQ,upgrade account"
}

### Example 2: Edge Condition (Missing Upgrade Substring)

**Input Payload:**

{
  "LinkValue": "site/page/info",
  "WTP:WT.ac": "site/page/info"
}

**Process:**
- Since neither string contains the substring ",upgrade account", no changes are made.

**Output Payload:**

{
  "LinkValue": "site/page/info",
  "WTP:WT.ac": "site/page/info"
}

### Example 3: Edge Condition (Additional Path Segments)

**Input Payload:**

{
  "LinkValue": "site/page/extra/info,upgrade account",
  "WTP:WT.ac": "site/page/another/segment,upgrade account"
}

**Process:**
- For `LinkValue`:  
  The value is split to produce `["site", "page", "extra", "info,upgrade account"]`.  
  Only the first two elements (`"site"` and `"page"`) are used, regardless of additional path segments.  
  The resulting string becomes `"site/page/CHQ,upgrade account"`.

- For `WTP:WT.ac`:  
  Likewise, the resultant string is `"site/page/CHQ,upgrade account"`.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Fixed Suffix Concatenation:**  
  The extension appends the fixed string `"/CHQ,upgrade account"` regardless of the original content beyond the first two segments. Any variations or additional path segments in the initial data are discarded, which might not be desired behaviour in all contexts.

- **Assumption on Delimiter Count:**  
  The code assumes that the URL-like structures always contain at least two segments split by "/". If the input string has fewer segments, this may result in an incorrect transformation.

- **Reliance on Case Insensitive Match:**  
  The use of `toLowerCase()` ensures case insensitivity; however, it may also lead to accidental matches if ",upgrade account" appears as part of another parameter or string value unexpectedly.

- **Potential Conflicts:**  
  If other Tealium extensions or external scripts modify the same properties (`LinkValue` or `WTP:WT.ac`) either before or after this extension runs, conflicts may occur leading to inconsistent or unexpected outcomes.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Additional Validation:**  
  Although the eventType and eventPayload are assumed to be present, consider adding checks for the existence and proper format of the URL-like strings to avoid unexpected errors when the payload structure changes.

- **Modularisation:**  
  Consider extracting the repeated logic into a helper function, for example, a function that cleans up any given key, to make future modifications easier and reduce code duplication.

- **Improve Readability:**  
  Add inline comments that clearly explain each step of the transformation process. This helps new developers quickly understand the logic and reduces onboarding time.

- **Consolidate Repeated Code:**  
  Both segments of the code (for `LinkValue` and `WTP:WT.ac`) are almost identical. Abstracting the cleanup process would reduce errors in future changes and improve maintainability.

- **Variable Naming:**  
  Although using single-letter aliases (such as `b`) is common in inline IIFE patterns, more descriptive names (e.g. payload or eventPayload) could improve readability in documentation, even if the code must remain ES5 compliant.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Version Control:**  
  Ensure that changes to this extension are version controlled and documented within your changeset system. Review and test changes in a staging environment prior to production deployment.

- **Ownership:**  
  Assign a specific team member or group as the maintainers of this extension so that any issues or required updates can be properly addressed.

- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  Create unit tests or test cases that simulate input payload variations (both normal and edge conditions) to verify that the extension behaves as expected. This is particularly important if there are changes in how the payload is structured or if the business logic evolves.

- **Documentation Updates:**  
  Keep this documentation up to date with any modifications made to the code base or the business requirements it supports. Regular reviews during sprint retrospectives or code audits are recommended.

- **Compatibility:**  
  Stay aware of potential impacts from other Tealium iQ extensions that may modify the same properties. Coordinate changes within your team to avoid unintended side effects.
