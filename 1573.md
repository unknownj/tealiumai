# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation - GA360 : XD : Persist xd_cid

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name**: GA360 : XD : Persist xd_cid
- **ID**: 100004
- **Type**: Persist Data Value
- **Scope**: After Load Rules
- **Execution Frequency**: Run Always

### Summary
This extension is designed to persist the `xd_cid` (a custom identifier for tracking user interaction) if the `GA360ClientID` variable is defined. It performs a series of actions to enhance user accessibility through integration with the Signly assistive technology. The extension primarily interacts with the web page by dynamically adding scripts and stylesheets to support the functionalities provided by Signly, while also tracking user engagement with the system.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- **LBGAnalytics**: A global object that handles analytics logging and event sending.
- **document.cookie**: Used to check for the presence of the `showSignly` flag.
- **document.querySelector**: Checks for the existence of the Signly input field.
- **localStorage**: Also checks for `showSignly` to determine whether to load Signly.

### Logic Flow
1. The primary function is triggered after a delay of 100 milliseconds.
2. It checks for the presence of the `showSignly` flag via cookies, inputs, and localStorage.
3. If found:
   - It sets an interval to check for the Signly logo and applies a specific class.
   - Loads the Signly CSS and JavaScript files dynamically into the page.
   - Tracks activation and user interactions using LBGAnalytics.
4. User interactions are tracked with event listeners for button clicks, allowing detailed reporting of activity related to translation requests and video interactions.

### Dependencies
- **LBGAnalytics**: The extension relies on this global object for analytics logging.
- **jQuery**: Implicit dependency due to the use of `$` in event binding.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Condition
- When a user visits a page with the `GA360ClientID` defined, the extension will:
  - Load Signly.
  - Allow the user to translate content.
  - Track each translation request through analytics.

### Edge Condition
- If cookies are not enabled or if the relevant DOM elements (e.g. `signly-logo`) are not present:
  - No actions will be taken, and no error will occur. The code includes try-catch blocks to handle these cases gracefully without affecting page functionality.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Browser Compatibility**: The use of `localStorage` requires a modern browser; older browsers may not support this.
- **Performance**: Continuous interval checks every 250 milliseconds may lead to performance issues if many elements are present, especially on lower-end devices.
- **Conflict with Other Scripts**: If multiple scripts manipulate the same DOM elements or classes, unexpected behaviour may occur.
  
## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks**: While the current version handles exceptions, it's advisable to add checks for LBGAnalytics availability before invoking methods on it.
- **Modularisation**: Consider breaking the code into smaller functions (e.g., separate functions for loading CSS, loading scripts, tracking events).
- **Code Style**: Maintain consistent indentation and whitespace for better readability; consider using `if` and `else` statements to reduce nesting.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ownership**: Assign a team member for ongoing maintenance to ensure the extension continues to function correctly with evolving web standards.
- **Testing Guidelines**: Regularly test across multiple browsers to ensure compatibility. Automated tests could be implemented for regression checking.
- **Documentation Updates**: This documentation should be reviewed and updated whenever enhancements or bug fixes are applied to the extension to reflect the most current functionality.
