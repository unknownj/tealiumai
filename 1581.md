# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: Fix Arrays in Celebrus Data

## Extension Overview
- **Name:** Fix Arrays in Celebrus Data
- **ID:** 1581
- **Type:** Javascript Code
- **Scope:** 1222
- **Execution Frequency:** Active

### Summary
This extension processes the `eventPayload` to ensure that any arrays within it are converted to comma-separated strings. This is particularly useful when integrating or forwarding data to Celebrus, which may expect a different format for array data. By transforming arrays into a string format, this extension ensures compatibility and prevents potential data handling issues.

## Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- `a`: Represents the `eventType`, which is expected to be a string.
- `b`: Represents the `eventPayload`, which is an object that may contain arrays.
- `u`: Represents the `tagObject`, but is not utilized in the current implementation.

### Logic Flow
1. The function iterates over the properties of the `eventPayload` object (`b`).
2. For each key `k` in `b`, it checks if the corresponding value is an array by validating the existence of `push` and `join` methods.
3. If the value is an array:
   - It converts the array into a comma-separated string using `join(",")`.
4. Any errors encountered during these operations are caught silently, preventing execution from breaking.

### Dependencies
- The code relies on the global objects `eventType` and `eventPayload`, which are provided by the Tealium environment. No other external libraries are needed for this extension to function.

## Usage Examples

### Normal Condition
**Input:**
```json
{
  "eventType": "page_view",
  "eventPayload": {
    "categories": ["electronics", "computers", "tablets"],
    "product_ids": ["12345", "67890"]
  }
}
```

**Output:**
```json
{
  "eventType": "page_view",
  "eventPayload": {
    "categories": "electronics,computers,tablets",
    "product_ids": "12345,67890"
  }
}
```

### Edge Condition
**Input:**
```json
{
  "eventType": "page_view",
  "eventPayload": {
    "categories": "not_an_array",
    "product_ids": []
  }
}
```

**Output:**
```json
{
  "eventType": "page_view",
  "eventPayload": {
    "categories": "not_an_array",
    "product_ids": ""
  }
}
```
In this case, the empty array is transformed into an empty string.

## Known Limitations & Gotchas
- **Error Handling**: The code catches all errors silently. If an error occurs while processing a property, it may lead to data loss or silent failures without diagnostic information.
- **Non-Array Data Types**: If the property value is a non-array (e.g., a string or number), it remains unchanged. This may be unintended for certain key-value pairs where array-like behaviour is expected.
- **Data Structure**: The extension does not recurse into nested objects or arrays, meaning that arrays within objects further nested in the `eventPayload` will not be addressed.

## Recommendations for Refactoring
- **Defensive Checks**: Consider implementing checks to ensure that `eventPayload` is indeed an object before processing it. This can prevent unexpected results.
- **Code Readability**: Use clear variable names instead of single-letter variables. For instance, replace `a`, `b`, and `u` with more descriptive names such as `eventType`, `eventPayload`, and `tagObject`.
- **Modularisation**: Extract the logic for checking and transforming arrays into a separate function. This makes the code more maintainable and testable.

Example refactoring could include:
```javascript
function transformArrays(payload) {
    for (var k in payload) {
        try {
            if (typeof payload[k].push === "function" && typeof payload[k].join === "function") {
                payload[k] = payload[k].join(",");
            }
        } catch (e) {
            // handle error or log message
        }
    }
}
transformArrays(eventPayload);
```

## Maintenance & Further Notes
- **Ownership**: Assign an owner for this extension within the development team, ensuring accountability for updates and issues.
- **Testing**: Regularly test the extension with a variety of `eventPayload` structures, particularly focusing on edge cases. Automated tests can be implemented to validate functionality with new updates or changes.
- **Documentation Updates**: Any changes to this extension should be documented thoroughly to keep stakeholders informed of the behaviour and implications of adjustments.
