# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: Fix Arrays in Celebrus Data

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name**: Fix Arrays in Celebrus Data
- **ID**: 1581
- **Type**: Javascript Code
- **Scope**: 1222
- **Execution Frequency**: Active

### Summary
The "Fix Arrays in Celebrus Data" extension is designed to process the incoming data structure within the Celebrus data layer. The extension automates the transformation of array data types present in the `eventPayload` into comma-separated strings to ensure compatibility with downstream systems that may not handle array formats effectively. This helps to standardise data transmission and improve overall data integrity.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- **`a`**: This parameter corresponds to `eventType`, a string representing the type of event being processed.
- **`b`**: This parameter corresponds to `eventPayload`, an object containing the event data, which may include arrays that need to be transformed.
- **`u`**: This parameter corresponds to `tagObject`, but it is not used in the current logic.

### Logic Flow
1. The code initiates an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) which takes `eventType`, `eventPayload`, and `tagObject` as arguments.
2. It iterates over each property (`k`) in the `eventPayload` object `b`. 
3. For each property, it checks if the property is an array by verifying if it has both `push` and `join` methods:
   - If both conditions are met, the array is transformed into a comma-separated string using `join(",")`, effectively replacing the original array.
4. Any errors that occur during this process are caught and ignored to ensure that the extension runs without interruption, even if there are unexpected data structures.

### Dependencies
- No external libraries or dependencies beyond the native JavaScript functionality are required.
- Relies on the standard JavaScript Array methods `push` and `join`.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Flow
1. **Input**:
   - `eventPayload` contains:
     ```javascript
     {
       "userIds": ["123", "456"],
       "actionTypes": ["click", "view"]
     }
     ```

2. **Output**:
   - After the extension processes this input, the `eventPayload` would be transformed to:
     ```javascript
     {
       "userIds": "123,456",
       "actionTypes": "click,view"
     }
     ```

### Edge Conditions
1. **Input with Non-Array Values**:
   - If `eventPayload` contains:
     ```javascript
     {
       "userId": "123",
       "actionTypes": ["click", "view"]
     }
     ```
   - The output remains unchanged for `userId`:
     ```javascript
     {
       "userId": "123",
       "actionTypes": "click,view"
     }
     ```
   - No errors are thrown.

2. **Input with Nested Arrays**:
   - Given an `eventPayload` like:
     ```javascript
     {
       "nested": [["inner1", "inner2"]]
     }
     ```
   - Only the first level of arrays will be processed and transformed, resulting in:
     ```javascript
     {
       "nested": [["inner1", "inner2"]]
     }
     ```

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Array Depth**: The extension only flattens one level of arrays. Nested arrays are not converted into strings.
- **Data Type Assumption**: The extension assumes that any property matching the array check (`push` and `join`) is indeed an array. If a property has those methods but is not an array, it may lead to unexpected results.
- **Global Scope**: Care should be taken when using the extension in conjunction with other global scripts that may modify the `eventType` or `eventPayload` before this extension executes.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Code Style**: While the current implementation is functional, using `for...in` can sometimes lead to unintended properties being accessed. Consider using `Object.keys(b)` combined with a standard `for` loop or a `forEach` loop to restrict the iteration to own properties only.
  
- **Defensive Checks**: Although we are not required to handle the availability of `eventType` and `eventPayload`, it may be prudent to check for the existence of properties before processing to avoid potential pitfalls in misstructured data.

- **Modularisation**: Consider breaking out the array-checking logic into a separate function. This enhances readability and allows for easier testing of specific functionalities.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance**: Regularly review the extension for compatibility with updated data structures or changes in external systems. Automated unit tests for various input scenarios can assist in maintaining the integrity of the extension.
  
- **Ownership**: Determine a single point of ownership for future development, updates, and documentation to ensure that any changes are well communicated and managed.

- **Testing Guidelines**: When testing the extension, consider a variety of inputs, including complex nested structures, to ensure robust performance. Log the outputs to facilitate easier debugging if issues arise.
