# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: OD PageRole Override

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name**: OD PageRole Override
- **ID**: 1582
- **Type**: Javascript Code
- **Scope**: After Load Rules
- **Execution Frequency**: Run Always

### Summary
The "OD PageRole Override" extension is designed to manipulate the `PageRole` value in the `eventPayload` object based on specific conditions related to the `JourneyName` and `JourneyProduct`. This extension is primarily aimed at ensuring that the dataLayer is correctly populated with values that reflect the current user's journey, thus enhancing the accuracy of tracking and analysis for user interactions.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- **eventType**: This parameter is expected to contain the event type that presumably triggers the execution of the extension (not explicitly used in the logic of this code).
- **eventPayload**: An object representing the payload of the event, which should contain various properties including `JourneyName` and `JourneyProduct`.

### Logic Flow
1. The extension checks if the `JourneyName` in the `eventPayload` equals `"ApplyOverdraft"`.
2. If the condition is met:
   - It sets the `PageRole` to `"Servicing"`.
   - Subsequently, it checks the value of `JourneyProduct`. If this value is `"Increase"` or `"New"`, the `PageRole` is overridden to `"Widgets"`.

### Dependencies
- The extension relies on the `eventPayload` object to access values related to user journey. There are no external libraries referenced, thus ensuring that the extension operates independently within the Tealium environment.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Flow
1. **Scenario A**: 
   - **Input**: `JourneyName` = "ApplyOverdraft", `JourneyProduct` = "New".
   - **Output**: `PageRole` is set to "Widgets".
  
2. **Scenario B**: 
   - **Input**: `JourneyName` = "ApplyOverdraft", `JourneyProduct` = "Other".
   - **Output**: `PageRole` is set to "Servicing".

### Edge Cases
- **Scenario C (Absent Journey)**:
   - **Input**: `JourneyName` = "SomeOtherJourney".
   - **Output**: `PageRole` remains unchanged (not set within this extension).
  
- **Scenario D (Unexpected Value)**:
   - **Input**: `JourneyName` = "ApplyOverdraft", `JourneyProduct` = null or an empty string.
   - **Output**: `PageRole` will be set to "Servicing", as it defaults when the conditions are met.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Condition Dependence**: The extension only activates for the specific case of `JourneyName` = "ApplyOverdraft". Other journey names will not trigger any changes.
- **Potential Conflicts**: If other extensions manipulate `PageRole` on the same execution scope after this extension, there may be undesirable outcomes. Care should be taken to ensure that they do not have conflicting logic.
- **Hardcoded Strings**: All strings are hardcoded; if the terminology for journey names or roles changes, the extension will require an update.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks**: A check to ensure `JourneyName` and `JourneyProduct` are defined before accessing them could improve stability, even though such checks are not mandatory given the availability guarantee.
- **Refactor for Readability**: While the logic is simple, comments could be added inline to improve clarity for future developers.
- **Modularisation**: Consider encapsulating the role setting logic in its own function, which would facilitate easier testing and maintenance.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ownership**: Assign a designated owner or team responsible for the ongoing maintenance of this extension to ensure updates are consistently applied when necessary.
- **Testing Guidelines**: Regular testing should be conducted to verify that changes to input variables are reflected correctly in `PageRole`. This should include both functional and edge case testing following changes.
- **Documentation Updates**: Keep this documentation updated with any changes to the extension's logic or behaviours to aid current and future developers in understanding the workings of this extension.

This documentation aims to provide a comprehensive overview for developers and stakeholders regarding the functionality and operation of the "OD PageRole Override" extension within Tealium iQ.
