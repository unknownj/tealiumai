# OD PageRole Override Extension Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive guide to the "OD PageRole Override" Tealium iQ extension. It covers an overview of the extension, code explanation, usage examples, limitations, refactoring recommendations, and maintenance notes.

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** OD PageRole Override  
- **ID:** 1582 (Extension Code), Extension Identifier: 100036  
- **Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** After Load Rules  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Always  

**Summary:**  
This extension inspects the event payload and overrides the PageRole value dynamically based on the JourneyName and JourneyProduct properties. Specifically, if the JourneyName equals "ApplyOverdraft", then the default PageRole value is set to "Servicing". Further checks on JourneyProduct refine this assignment by setting the PageRole to "Widgets" when JourneyProduct equals either "Increase" or "New". This functionality ensures consistent page role tagging across variations of a user journey.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- **a & b:**  
  The extension receives two parameters. By conventional usage, `a` (eventType) and `b` (eventPayload) are assumed to be mapped respectively to the event type identifier (a string) and the event payload (an object).

- **b.PageRole:**  
  An attribute in the event payload that is being dynamically modified based on the conditions.

- **b.JourneyName & b.JourneyProduct:**  
  Properties in the event payload that determine which conditions apply:
  - `b.JourneyName` is used to verify that the event belongs to the "ApplyOverdraft" journey.
  - `b.JourneyProduct` distinguishes between product types ("Increase" or "New") further adjusting the PageRole.

### Logic Flow and Data Processing
1. **Primary Condition:**  
   The code first checks if the `JourneyName` property of the payload equals "ApplyOverdraft".
   - If true, the default assignment is to set `PageRole` to "Servicing".

2. **Nested Conditions:**  
   Within the same block, it checks the value of `JourneyProduct`:
   - If `JourneyProduct` equals "Increase":  
     The `PageRole` is overridden and set to "Widgets".
   - If `JourneyProduct` equals "New":  
     Similarly, the `PageRole` is overridden to "Widgets".

### Dependencies
- **Global Objects:**  
  The code depends on the globally provided variables `eventType` and `eventPayload` (aliased as `a` and `b` respectively).  
- **No External Libraries:**  
  The logic is self-contained and does not rely on any external libraries.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Example 1: Standard "ApplyOverdraft" with Default Servicing Role
- **Input Event Payload:**
  - JourneyName: "ApplyOverdraft"
  - JourneyProduct: "OtherProduct"
- **Process:**
  - The first condition matches (JourneyName equals "ApplyOverdraft").
  - `PageRole` is set initially to "Servicing".
  - Since JourneyProduct is not "Increase" or "New", no further changes are applied.
- **Result:**  
  The event payload will have `PageRole` as "Servicing".

### Example 2: "ApplyOverdraft" with JourneyProduct "Increase"
- **Input Event Payload:**
  - JourneyName: "ApplyOverdraft"
  - JourneyProduct: "Increase"
- **Process:**
  - The code sets `PageRole` to "Servicing" based on JourneyName.
  - It detects JourneyProduct to be "Increase" and then reassigns `PageRole` to "Widgets".
- **Result:**  
  The event payload will have `PageRole` as "Widgets".

### Example 3: "ApplyOverdraft" with JourneyProduct "New"
- **Input Event Payload:**
  - JourneyName: "ApplyOverdraft"
  - JourneyProduct: "New"
- **Process:**
  - The initial condition is satisfied and sets `PageRole` to "Servicing".
  - Since JourneyProduct equals "New", the role is updated to "Widgets".
- **Result:**  
  The event payload will have `PageRole` as "Widgets".

### Example 4: Non "ApplyOverdraft" Journey
- **Input Event Payload:**
  - JourneyName: "SomeOtherJourney"
  - JourneyProduct: Any value
- **Process:**
  - The primary condition fails since JourneyName is not "ApplyOverdraft".
  - No modifications are applied to the `PageRole`.
- **Result:**  
  The event payload remains unchanged with respect to `PageRole`.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Sequential Overwrites:**  
  The nested conditions override the initial PageRole. If additional criteria need to be maintained, the current approach may need to be restructured to handle multiple conditions in a more modular fashion.

- **Ordering of Conditions:**  
  The code assumes that the JourneyProduct conditions are only relevant when JourneyName equals "ApplyOverdraft". If there are cases when JourneyProduct should be processed independently, the current logic does not cover these scenarios.

- **Potential Conflicts:**  
  - If there are other Tealium extensions that also modify `PageRole` at the same scope (After Load Rules) and execution frequency, conflicts might arise.
  - Ensure that no other scripts override the changes applied by this extension further down the processing chain.

- **Hardcoded Values:**  
  Magic strings like "ApplyOverdraft", "Servicing", "Increase", "New", and "Widgets" are directly embedded in the code. Any updates to these values require code modification.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Modularisation:**  
  Consider breaking the logic into distinct functions that handle:
  - Verification of the journey type.
  - Determination and assignment of the PageRole based on product type.
  This separation of concerns can facilitate unit testing and future enhancements.

- **Use of Commenting:**  
  Increase inline documentation within the code to explain the purpose of conditionals and expected outcomes for future maintainers.

- **Avoiding Redundant Conditions:**  
  The checks for "Increase" and "New" are both assigning the same value ("Widgets"). It might be beneficial to consolidate these checks:
  
  Example (ES5 compliant):
  
  // Note: Using a single if-block for product types
  if (b.JourneyName === "ApplyOverdraft") {
    b.PageRole = "Servicing";
    if (b.JourneyProduct === "Increase" || b.JourneyProduct === "New") {
      b.PageRole = "Widgets";
    }
  }
  
- **Testing Scenarios:**  
  Establish a set of unit tests or QA tests to simulate various payloads, ensuring that changes in one condition do not unexpectedly impact the others.

- **Scalability:**  
  If more product types or journey names need to be supported in the future, consider using mapping objects (while maintaining ES5 compatibility) to replace multiple nested if statements.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ownership:**  
  Clearly assign ownership of this extension to a developer or team responsible for updates to related journey and product tagging.

- **Version Control:**  
  Maintain versioning of this extension within your Tealium deployment to track changes and recover previous versions if issues are introduced.

- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Develop test payloads covering all possible combinations of JourneyName and JourneyProduct.
  - Confirm that the extension only triggers when appropriate conditions are met.
  - Review its integration with other page-level scripts to avoid conflicts with similar overrides.

- **Documentation Updates:**  
  As the business logic evolves (e.g. new JourneyProducts or new role assignments), update this documentation accordingly to maintain accuracy.

- **Logging:**  
  Although not implemented in this ES5 extension, consider adding logging (if permitted) during debugging phases to track condition evaluations and final role assignment. Ensure such logging is removed in production to avoid performance issues.

This documentation should serve as a definitive guide for developers working with or maintaining the "OD PageRole Override" extension in Tealium iQ. Please update the documentation as further changes are made to the logic or environment.
