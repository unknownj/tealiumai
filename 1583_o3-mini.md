# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the "GA360 : XD : Set link decoration type : linking pages" extension. It covers the extension overview, code explanation, usage examples, known limitations, recommendations for refactoring, and maintenance guidelines.

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** GA360 : XD : Set link decoration type : linking pages  
- **ID:** 1583  
- **Type:** Advanced Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** Before Load Rules  
- **Occurrence:** Run Always  

**Summary:**  
This extension determines the link decoration type based on the page identifier and brand within the incoming data layer. By extracting the final segment of the SectionID and considering the brand (either "Halifax" or "Lloyds"), it maps the page to a predefined decoration method. If no match is found, it defaults the decoration type to "none". This is primarily used for setting link decoration parameters for Google Analytics 360 in cross-domain scenarios.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables and Functions

- **Input Variables:**
  - `eventType`: Expected to be a string (provided globally).
  - `eventPayload` (aliased as `b`): Object containing the data layer with properties like `SectionID`, `Brand`, and `ut.env`.

- **Primary Function:**
  - `set_link_decoration_type(dl)`:  
    - Accepts the data layer object (`dl`).
    - Splits `dl.SectionID` using `":"` to capture the last element of the identifier (denoted as `section_id_last`).
    - Reads `dl.Brand` to decide which set of link decoration mappings to use.
    - Defines an object (`link_decoration_type_values`) which maps page identifiers (keys) to their respective decoration types (values). Two different mappings exist for "Halifax" and "Lloyds".
    - Returns the decoration type based on the extracted `section_id_last`. If no matching key exists, the returned value is `undefined` or `null`.

- **Post Function Execution:**
  - After calling `set_link_decoration_type`, the code checks if the returned `link_decoration_type` is either `null` or `undefined`. If so, it assigns a default value of `"none"`.
  - In a development environment (when `b["ut.env"]` equals `"dev"`), the decoration type is logged to the console.
  - Finally, the decoration type is added to the data layer with `b.link_decoration_type = link_decoration_type`.

### Logic Flow

1. **Extract Section Identifier:**  
   - The code splits the `SectionID` by `":"` and retrieves the last segment as the page identifier.

2. **Determine Brand Mapping:**  
   - Depending on whether `dl.Brand` is `"Halifax"` or `"Lloyds"`, the appropriate mapping object is selected.  
   - Each mapping contains several commented and uncommented properties, allowing for granular control over which pages receive a `"standard"` decoration type.

3. **Apply Mapping & Fallback:**  
   - The decoration type is fetched from the mapping using `section_id_last` as the key.
   - If no matching key exists (resulting in an `undefined` value), the extension defaults the decoration type to `"none"`.

4. **Output & Debug:**  
   - If in a development environment, the chosen decoration type is logged.
   - The final value is then stored on the data layer payload.

### Dependencies

- The extension depends on the global variables `eventType` and `eventPayload`, which are guaranteed to be present.
- It leverages properties from `eventPayload` (accessed via `b`) such as:
  - `SectionID`
  - `Brand`
  - `ut.env` (to decide if console logging is necessary)

## 3. Usage Examples

### Example 1: Standard Halifax Scenario

**Input:**  
- `dl.SectionID = "home:bankaccounts_switch_to_halifax"`  
- `dl.Brand = "Halifax"`

**Process:**  
- The function splits `SectionID` into an array and extracts `"bankaccounts_switch_to_halifax"`.
- The extension then uses the Halifax mapping which has `"bankaccounts_switch_to_halifax"` explicitly set to `"standard"`.
- The decoration type `"standard"` is returned, logged (if in dev mode), and assigned to `eventPayload.link_decoration_type`.

**Output:**  
```
eventPayload.link_decoration_type = "standard"
```

---

### Example 2: Standard Lloyds Scenario

**Input:**  
- `dl.SectionID = "section:current_accounts_all_accounts"`  
- `dl.Brand = "Lloyds"`

**Process:**  
- The function extracts `"current_accounts_all_accounts"` from the `SectionID`.
- The Lloyds mapping contains an entry for `"current_accounts_all_accounts"` set to `"standard"`.
- The decoration type is set accordingly.

**Output:**  
```
eventPayload.link_decoration_type = "standard"
```

---

### Example 3: No Matching Mapping

**Input:**  
- `dl.SectionID = "misc:unknown_page"`  
- `dl.Brand = "Halifax"` (or `"Lloyds"`)

**Process:**  
- The function extracts `"unknown_page"`, which is not a key in the corresponding mapping.
- As the retrieved value is `undefined`, the default `"none"` is assigned.
- This fallback behaviour ensures that the decoration type is always defined.

**Output:**  
```
eventPayload.link_decoration_type = "none"
```

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Commented Out Mappings:**  
  - Many mapping entries are commented out, which may lead developers to inadvertently forget to uncomment and apply needed configurations. It is important to review these comments if new pages need to be supported.
  
- **Reliance on Input Format:**  
  - The extension assumes `SectionID` has a predictable format with colon-delimited values. An unexpected format may result in the wrong page identifier being extracted.
  
- **Brand Dependency:**  
  - The mapping logic is entirely split by the `Brand` value. An unexpected or null `Brand` value will bypass the expected mapping, potentially resulting in a default `"none"` output.

- **Potential Conflicts:**  
  - If other Tealium extensions modify the same `eventPayload` properties or interfere with the `ut.env` property for logging, it may cause conflicts or unexpected behaviour.
  
- **Strict ES5 Requirement:**  
  - The code adheres to ES5 syntax; any proposals to refactor using newer ECMAScript syntax must avoid ES6+ features due to compatibility requirements.

---

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks:**  
  - Although `eventType` and `eventPayload` are guaranteed, consider adding comments or logging to verify the presence and correct type of mandatory properties (`SectionID`, `Brand`) to assist future debugging.

- **Improve Readability and Maintainability:**  
  - Separate the mapping definitions for "Halifax" and "Lloyds" into distinct functions or external configuration objects. This will make updates easier and reduce clutter within the main function.
  - Group similar mappings and add inline comments where necessary to explain why certain pages are set to `"standard"` or `"fragment"`.

- **Modularisation:**  
  - Consider refactoring the function into smaller helper functions if further complexity is anticipated. For example:
    - A function to extract the page identifier.
    - A function to select the mapping based on `Brand`.
  
- **Extensibility:**  
  - Document the intended use of commented mapping entries so that future modifications (i.e. uncommenting certain lines) are done with understanding of the original design decisions.

- **Code Style:**  
  - Maintain consistent indentation and spacing throughout the code. Even though ES5 restricts the usage of specific modern constructs, clear formatting and comments help maintain readability.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**
  - Regularly review and update the mapping objects to ensure new pages or design changes are reflected.
  - Maintain a changelog in the code comments or internal documentation to track modifications or additions to the mapping logic.

- **Ownership:**
  - Define a primary owner or team responsible for tracking changes in link decoration rules. Include contacts or a reference to a shared maintenance document.

- **Testing Guidelines:**
  - Set up automated tests to validate that for known inputs (combinations of `SectionID` and `Brand`), the extension returns the expected `link_decoration_type`.
  - Test edge cases where `SectionID` might not follow the expected format.
  - Verify in development environments that console logs are accurate and that the default `"none"` decoration is correctly applied.

- **Documentation Updates:**
  - Ensure that any changes to the mapping logic are reflected in this documentation.
  - Utilize code comments to further explain complex logic, especially around areas where decisions (such as default or commented out mappings) may not be immediately obvious.
