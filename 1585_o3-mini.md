# GA360 : XD : Set Cross-Track Domain List Documentation

This document provides an in-depth explanation of the Tealium iQ extension titled “GA360 : XD : Set cross-track domain list”. The documentation outlines the extension’s purpose, code logic and structure, usage examples, limitations, potential gotchas, and recommendations for future improvements.

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** GA360 : XD : Set cross-track domain list
- **ID:** 1585 (Tealium Extension ID: 100040)
- **Type:** Advanced Javascript Code
- **Scope:** Before Load Rules
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Always

**Summary:**  
This extension is designed to generate an array of domain strings based on the current brand value present in the data layer (`dl.Brand`). The generated domain list is intended to be passed to Google Analytics 360’s (GA360) linker object for cross-domain tracking. By conditionally setting different domain arrays for "Halifax", "Lloyds", and "BOS", the extension assists in the correct configuration of cross-domain linking for multiple banking brands.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Components and Variables

- **IIFE Parameters:**  
  - `a`: Intended to represent `eventType`.  
  - `b`: Intended to represent `eventPayload` (data object with various properties including `Brand`).

- **Primary Function:**  
  `set_cross_track_domains(dl)`  
  - **Parameter:** `dl` – The data layer object containing the property `Brand`.
  - **Purpose:** Determines which array of domain strings to return based on the value of `dl.Brand`.

- **Local Variables:**  
  - `brand`: Stores the value of `dl.Brand`.  
  - `domains`: Declared to hold the array of domain strings for the corresponding brand.

### Logic Flow

1. **Brand Extraction:**  
   The function extracts the brand value from the provided `dl` object:
   - `var brand = dl.Brand;`

2. **Conditional Checks:**  
   The function then uses a series of `if` / `else if` statements to check the brand:
   - If `brand === "Halifax"`, the function sets `domains` to an array containing:
     - "halifax.co.uk"
     - "halifax-online.co.uk"
     - "halifaxsharedealing-online.co.uk"
   - Else if `brand === "Lloyds"`, the function sets `domains` to:
     - "lloydsbank.co.uk"
     - "lloydsbank.com"
   - Else if `brand === "BOS"`, the function sets `domains` to:
     - "bankofscotland.co.uk"

3. **Return Value:**  
   For each recognised brand condition, the function returns the corresponding `domains` array.  
   *Note:* If the `brand` does not match any of these conditions, the function returns `undefined`.

4. **Global Assignment:**  
   Outside of the function, the returned function is assigned to property `cross_track_domains` on the `b` (eventPayload) object:
   - `b.cross_track_domains = set_cross_track_domains(b);`

### Dependencies on Global Objects or Libraries

- **Global Objects Passed In:**  
  - The IIFE parameters (`eventType` and `eventPayload`) are used.  
  - The code directly accesses `b.Brand` as part of the data layer.  
  - No external libraries are referenced; however, the extension assumes that `eventType` (a string) and `eventPayload` (an object) are available and correctly provided by the Tealium environment.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Example 1 – Brand is “Halifax”

- **Input Data Layer (`dl`):**
  {
    Brand: "Halifax"
  }
- **Execution:**
  - The condition `brand === "Halifax"` is met.
  - Returns the array:  
    ["halifax.co.uk", "halifax-online.co.uk", "halifaxsharedealing-online.co.uk"]
- **Result:**
  - `eventPayload.cross_track_domains` will contain the above array.

---

### Example 2 – Brand is “Lloyds”

- **Input Data Layer (`dl`):**
  {
    Brand: "Lloyds"
  }
- **Execution:**
  - The condition `brand === "Lloyds"` is met.
  - Returns the array:  
    ["lloydsbank.co.uk", "lloydsbank.com"]
- **Result:**
  - `eventPayload.cross_track_domains` will contain the above array.

---

### Example 3 – Brand is “BOS”

- **Input Data Layer (`dl`):**
  {
    Brand: "BOS"
  }
- **Execution:**
  - The condition `brand === "BOS"` is met.
  - Returns the array:  
    ["bankofscotland.co.uk"]
- **Result:**
  - `eventPayload.cross_track_domains` will contain the above array.

---

### Example 4 – Brand is an Unhandled Value (Edge Condition)

- **Input Data Layer (`dl`):**
  {
    Brand: "SomeOtherBrand"
  }
- **Execution:**
  - None of the specified conditions are satisfied.
  - Function returns `undefined`.
- **Result:**
  - `eventPayload.cross_track_domains` will be assigned `undefined`, which may need to be handled downstream if unexpected.

---

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Unhandled Brands:**  
  - If the value of `dl.Brand` is not one of “Halifax”, “Lloyds”, or “BOS”, the function returns `undefined`. Downstream processes relying on a domain array may fail or behave unexpectedly.

- **No Fallback Mechanism:**  
  - There is no default case to handle brands not explicitly specified. Adding a fallback or warning could mitigate potential issues.

- **Dependency on Data Layer Integrity:**  
  - The function assumes that `dl.Brand` is always defined. If for some reason this property is missing or misspelt, the function will not return an expected output.

- **Potential Conflicts:**  
  - Other Tealium extensions or external scripts that modify `eventPayload` or rely on similarly named properties might conflict if not coordinated.

---

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Coding:**  
  - Although defensive checks for the availability of `eventType` and `eventPayload` are not required, consider verifying that `dl.Brand` exists before processing.
  - Add a fallback or error logging for cases where the brand does not match the expected values.

- **Modularisation and Readability:**  
  - Encapsulate the conditional checks in a single return statement to avoid multiple return points if possible. However, since the code needs to remain ES5-compliant, ensure that refactoring still uses `var` for variable declarations.
  
- **Consistent Return:**  
  - Instead of returning inside each conditional block, consider setting the `domains` variable during the checks and providing a single return at the end. This may improve readability and maintenance.
  
- **Documentation and Comments:**  
  - Expand inline comments to include explanations for the purpose of each branch (e.g. detailing why specific domain arrays are chosen for each brand).

---

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  - Ensure that any change in brand names or the addition of new brands is reflected in the conditional logic.
  - Regularly verify that the domain arrays remain up to date with organisational changes or new tracking requirements in GA360.

- **Ownership:**  
  - Assign a dedicated repository or source control location for maintaining Tealium extensions.  
  - Clearly document version changes in both the code (as seen by the v1.2.1 comment) and the accompanying documentation.

- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Create test cases for each conditional branch, including edge cases where `dl.Brand` is not recognised.
  - Validate the outputs both in a development environment and as part of the QA process before deploying to production.
  
- **Collaboration:**  
  - Encourage feedback from integration teams to ensure the extension’s functionality aligns with cross-domain tracking requirements in GA360.
  - Maintain a changelog that records modifications, add-ons, or bug fixes in the future.

By following this documentation and the recommendations listed, teams will be better equipped to maintain, troubleshoot, and further develop this Tealium iQ extension with confidence.
