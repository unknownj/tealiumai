# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: Responsive Sizes

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name**: Responsive Sizes
- **ID**: 100040
- **Type**: Advanced JavaScript Code
- **Scope**: 928
- **Execution Frequency**: Active

### Summary
The "Responsive Sizes" extension is designed to evaluate the current viewport size of the user's browser and establish which predefined size category the viewport falls into. It generates a string that indicates the size category, which is appended to the presentation type if it matches "Responsive." This functionality aids in better understanding user device characteristics and can enhance user experience by tailoring content based on the userâ€™s screen size.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- **breakpoints**: An array of defined pixel values representing the breakpoint thresholds for different device sizes.
- **opstring**: A string that will store the output reflecting the size category based on the viewport width.

### Logic Flow
1. The extension begins with a try-catch block to manage potential execution errors.
2. An empty string (`opstring`) is initialized to hold the output size category.
3. The extension iterates over the `breakpoints` array:
   - For each breakpoint, it determines the current range of size categories (defined by `from` and `to`).
   - It applies `window.matchMedia` to assess whether the current viewport matches the defined size conditions.
   - Based on these conditions, it constructs `opstring` with suitable text indicating the category size, such as "Up to" or "and above".
4. If an error occurs during execution, `opstring` is set to "Error".
5. Finally, if the `b.Presentation` variable equals "Responsive", it appends the generated size category to it.

### Dependencies
- The extension relies on the global `window` object, specifically the `matchMedia` method, which checks media query matches against the current viewport.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Normal Operation
- **Input**: A user navigates to a page on a device with a viewport width of 500 pixels.
- **Output**: The extension processes this width, determines it falls within the "Up to 650" size category, and updates `b.Presentation` to "Responsive - Size 2: Up to 650".

### Scenario 2: Edge Case
- **Input**: A user uses a device with a viewport width of 1000 pixels.
- **Output**: The extension finds that the width matches the "990 and above" category. It updates `b.Presentation` to "Responsive - Size 8: 990 and above".

### Scenario 3: Error Handling
- **Input**: If an error occurs during the viewport size evaluation (e.g., manipulation of the matchMedia function).
- **Output**: `opstring` is set to "Error", and `b.Presentation` reflects the original state with no size category appended.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- The extension may not function correctly if the device's screen size changes after the initial execution without a page reload.
- If multiple extensions modify `b.Presentation`, there could be conflicts leading to unexpected results, especially if they manipulate the same properties.
- If `matchMedia` is not supported in certain older browsers, the extension may behave unpredictably.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Modularization**: Consider breaking down the main logic into smaller functions for better readability and maintainability. For instance, separating the size determination logic into its own function can make testing easier.
- **Variable Naming**: Use more meaningful variable names than `opstring` to improve code clarity.
- **Commenting**: Add comments to clarify key parts of the logic, making it easier for future developers to understand the intent.
- **Defensive Checks**: While not required, adding checks for potential out-of-range values in `breakpoints` may prevent unexpected behaviour.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance**: Regularly review and test the extension with various devices and browsers to ensure it remains functional and relevant.
- **Ownership**: Designate a team member to be responsible for updates and documentation.
- **Testing Guidelines**: Establish a testing protocol to assess the extension's performance with new device sizes and browser updates, ensuring consistent behaviour and reliability.
