# Responsive Sizes Extension Documentation

This document outlines the details, functionality, usage examples, limitations, recommendations, and maintenance guidelines for the Responsive Sizes extension.

---

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Responsive Sizes  
- **ID:** 1589 (internal instance ID)  
- **Extension Type:** Advanced Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** 928  
- **Execution Frequency:** The code executes each time an event is processed where the extension conditions are met (typically on every page load or tag fire as defined in Tealium iQ).

**Summary:**  
The Responsive Sizes extension determines the current browser viewport width using predefined breakpoints and appends a descriptive string (including a size range) to the `Presentation` property within the event payload. This allows downstream tags or endpoints to understand the responsive dimensions of the user’s device, which is particularly useful for responsive web design tracking.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables and Parameters

- **Parameters:**  
  The extension is encapsulated in an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) that accepts three parameters:  
  - `a` representing `eventType` (a string),  
  - `b` representing `eventPayload` (an object), and  
  - `u` representing `tagObject` (an object).

- **opstring:**  
  A string variable initialised to an empty string. It will later hold descriptive information about the detected size range.

- **breakpoints:**  
  An array of numbers representing the pixel width thresholds used to define different responsive size ranges:  
  ```
  [360, 480, 650, 736, 768, 884, 990, 1024, 1600]
  ```

### Logic Flow

1. **Initial Setup and Error Handling:**  
   - The code is wrapped in a `try/catch` block. Any error during execution will result in `opstring` being set to `"Error"`.

2. **Iteration Through Breakpoints:**  
   - A `for` loop iterates with a counter variable `i` starting at `-1` up to `breakpoints.length - 1`.  
   - For each iteration:
     - The **from** (start) and **to** (end) values for the current size range are determined:
       - If `i` is negative (first iteration), `from` is set to `0`.
       - If `i` is greater than or equal to zero, `from` is set to the breakpoint at index `i`.
       - `to` is set to the next breakpoint if available; otherwise, it is set to a large number (effectively representing infinity).
     - **Media Queries:**  
       - The code utilises `window.matchMedia` to check if the browser window’s width is less than or equal to the lower and upper bounds.  
       - The condition requires that:
         - The window does **not** match the query for `(max-width: from px)` **and**  
         - The window **does** match the query for `(max-width: to px)`.
     - **Building the opstring:**  
       - If the media query condition is met, the code builds `opstring` by:
         - Prefixing with `"Size "` and the current size number (calculated as `i + 2`).
         - Appending a range descriptor:
           - If `from` is the minimum value (`0`), it states `"Up to to"`.
           - If `to` is the maximum value (`1000000`), it states `"from and above"`.
           - Otherwise, it states `"from to to"`.

3. **Appending to the Event Payload:**  
   - After the loop, if the `Presentation` property in the `eventPayload` object equals `"Responsive"`, the code appends `opstring` to it in the format:  
     ```
     "Responsive - " + opstring
     ```
   - This results in a modified `Presentation` field with additional size information.

### Dependencies

- The extension depends on:
  - The `window` object, in particular, the `matchMedia` method for evaluating CSS media queries.
  - The global structure of `eventPayload` (property `Presentation`) being used by downstream processes in Tealium.
  - The existence and proper initialisation of `eventType` and `eventPayload` (which are assured in your environment).

## 3. Usage Examples

### Example 1: Mobile Device Scenario

- **Context:**  
  A user visits the website using a mobile device with a viewport width of 320 pixels.

- **Processing:**  
   - In the first iteration (`i = -1`):  
     - `from` is set to `0`  
     - `to` is set to `360`  
   - The media queries evaluate such that the device does not match `(max-width: 0px)` but does match `(max-width: 360px)`.  
   - `opstring` is then set to `"Size 1: Up to 360"`.

- **Output:**  
   - If `eventPayload.Presentation` was originally `"Responsive"`, it becomes:  
     ```
     "Responsive - Size 1: Up to 360"
     ```

### Example 2: Tablet or Desktop Scenario

- **Context:**  
  A user’s browser width is 800 pixels.

- **Processing:**  
   - The loop will cycle through until it finds the appropriate size range where:
     - For one of the iterations, assume that `from` equals `768` and `to` equals `884`.
   - Media queries confirm the condition is met.  
   - `opstring` is set to `"Size X: 768 to 884"` (with X being the calculated size number).

- **Output:**  
   - `eventPayload.Presentation` will be updated to include the detected range, for example:  
     ```
     "Responsive - Size X: 768 to 884"
     ```

### Edge Conditions

- **Exact Breakpoint Values:**  
  - If the viewport exactly equals one of the breakpoint boundaries, the media query conditions are used to determine the proper range.  
- **Viewport Greater than Maximum Breakpoint:**  
  - For very large screens, the last iteration will use `from` as the highest breakpoint and `to` as the large number (1000000), resulting in an output indicating `"from and above"`.

---

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Browser Compatibility:**  
  - The code relies on `window.matchMedia`. Although widely supported in modern browsers, it may not work as intended in very old browsers that lack ES5 support or the `matchMedia` API.
  
- **Assumption on Presentation Field:**  
  - The extension assumes that `eventPayload` contains a property named `Presentation` with the value `"Responsive"`. If this is altered by another process or extension, it might not append the size details as expected.

- **Sequential Execution Dependency:**  
  - If multiple extensions update the `Presentation` property in sequence, the appended information could grow undesirably or conflict with other extension outputs.
  
- **Breakpoints Ordering:**  
  - The breakpoints must be in ascending order. Incorrect ordering will yield inaccurate size range detection.

- **Error Handling:**  
  - In case any error occurs within the try block, `opstring` is set to `"Error"`, which might not be adequately processed downstream unless proper error handling is implemented at the consumption point.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Code Organisation:**  
  - Consider refactoring the breakpoint processing into a helper function to improve readability and maintainability.
  
- **Variable Naming:**  
  - Enhance variable names to be more descriptive (e.g. change `i` to `breakpointIndex`) to improve code clarity.
  
- **Comments and Documentation:**  
  - Add inline comments to further explain each step of the loop and the media queries for developers unfamiliar with the logic.
  
- **Consider Modularisation:**  
  - Although the ES5 requirement restricts using newer syntax, you might still structure the code into distinct functions within the ES5 standard to separate concerns and ease future updates.
  
- **Defensive Checks:**  
  - While availability of `eventType` and `eventPayload` is guaranteed, additional checks for the existence of `window.matchMedia` in legacy environments could be helpful if there is any uncertainty about browser compatibility.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Testing:**  
  - Regularly test the extension across different browsers and devices to ensure that media query evaluations are consistent.
  - Automated tests should include various viewport widths, especially edge cases at breakpoint boundaries.

- **Ownership:**  
  - Designate a primary developer or team who is responsible for maintaining this extension. Ensure that any changes to the breakpoint values or logic are documented in version control.
  
- **Version Control and Change Logging:**  
  - Maintain a changelog documenting any modifications or bug fixes to the extension code.
  
- **Future Enhancements:**  
  - Evaluate whether further responsive parameters (beyond viewport width) need to be incorporated.
  - Monitor browser API changes to ensure that `matchMedia` remains a reliable method for media queries.
  
- **Stakeholder Communication:**  
  - Share this documentation with stakeholders to ensure that the purpose and functionality of the extension are well understood. Developer onboarding should include a review of these guidelines.
  
- **Documentation Updates:**  
  - Regularly update this documentation if the code logic is adjusted or if new features are added to prevent miscommunication.
