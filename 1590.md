# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: Basket Bits

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name**: Basket Bits
- **ID**: 1590
- **Type**: Advanced Javascript Code
- **Scope**: Before Load Rules
- **Execution Frequency**: Run Always

### Summary
The "Basket Bits" extension is designed to interact with the `LBGAnalytics` library to collect and send basket-related data for analytics purposes. Specifically, it retrieves items from the basket and correlates them with a predefined eVar (eVar32), allowing for enhanced tracking and reporting on user interactions with the shopping basket.

---

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- **LBGAnalytics**: A global object that interfaces with the analytics platform.
- **eventType**: A string representing the event that triggers execution.
- **eventPayload**: An object containing the data payload relevant to the event.

### Logic Flow
1. The extension immediately invokes a function with `eventType` and `eventPayload` as parameters.
2. It retrieves the current basket data using `LBGAnalytics.basket.get()`, which returns an array of items.
3. The `.map()` method iterates through each item in the basket:
   - For each item, it calls `LBGAnalytics.correlations.add()` to correlate the item with `evar32`, using an array containing the ID `610`.

### Dependencies on Global Objects or Libraries
- The extension relies on the existence and correct initialisation of the `LBGAnalytics` library.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Condition
When a user adds items to their shopping basket, the extension triggers `eventType` associated with the addition event. The items are processed, and each item's details are sent to the analytics server, allowing for insights on which products contribute to the basket.

### Edge Condition
If the basket is empty, `LBGAnalytics.basket.get()` would return an empty array. The `.map()` function would not execute any additional logic since there are no items to iterate over, resulting in no calls to `LBGAnalytics.correlations.add()`.

---

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Empty Basket**: If there are no items in the basket, the extension runs without errors but does not send any data to the analytics platform.
- **Dependency on LBGAnalytics**: If for any reason the `LBGAnalytics` library is not loaded or available before this extension executes, it will lead to a failure in data collection.
- **Interaction with Other Extensions**: If other extensions modify `LBGAnalytics` actions or trigger events that affect the state of the basket, it may lead to unexpected results. Care should be taken to ensure no conflicting manipulations occur elsewhere.

---

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks**: While we’re not worried about the presence of `eventType` or `eventPayload`, consider adding checks for `LBGAnalytics` to ensure it is loaded before attempting to use it.
- **Code Style**: 
  - Utilize traditional function expressions instead of newer syntax to ensure compatibility with ES5. For instance, replacing `.map()` with a traditional `for` loop could enhance readability for developers familiar with classic JavaScript.
  
  ```javascript
  var basketItems = LBGAnalytics.basket.get();
  for (var i = 0; i < basketItems.length; i++) {
      LBGAnalytics.correlations.add({evar32: basketItems[i]}, [610]);
  }
  ```

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ownership**: Designate a responsible developer or team to manage the extension’s updates and performance checks.
- **Ongoing Maintenance**: Regularly verify if updates to `LBGAnalytics` could affect this extension. Schedule periodic reviews based on analytics usage reports.
- **Testing Guidelines**: Implement testing protocols to validate that basket data is correctly sent and correlated after updates to the extension or the underlying analytics library. Consider edge cases such as empty baskets and unexpected data formats.
