# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: Basket Bits

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name**: Basket Bits
- **ID**: 1590
- **Type**: Advanced Javascript Code
- **Scope**: Before Load Rules
- **Execution Frequency**: Run Always

### Summary
The "Basket Bits" extension processes basket-related analytics by extracting data from the LBGAnalytics global object. The extension retrieves basket items and sends a specific correlation to the analytics platform, aimed at enhancing e-commerce tracking and decision-making.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- **LBGAnalytics**: A global object assumed to be provided by an external library or script, offering methods to interact with basket data and analytics.
  
### Logic Flow
1. The function is immediately invoked using the parameters `eventType` and `eventPayload`.
2. `LBGAnalytics.basket.get()` is called to retrieve an array of items from the user's basket.
3. The method `.map()` is employed on the array of items. For each item in the basket:
   - The method `LBGAnalytics.correlations.add()` is called, passing the `evar32` property set to the current item and an array containing the number `610`. This sends the correlation data to the analytics system.

### Dependencies
- **LBGAnalytics**: This must be included and correctly configured to ensure functionality.
- The extension relies on the basket structure provided by `LBGAnalytics.basket.get()`.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Example 1: Normal Condition
- **Scenario**: A user adds three items to their cart.
  - Data returned from `LBGAnalytics.basket.get()` would be an array containing these items.
  - The extension will invoke `LBGAnalytics.correlations.add()` for each item, sending their respective data to the analytics system.

### Example 2: Edge Condition
- **Scenario**: The basket is empty.
  - `LBGAnalytics.basket.get()` returns an empty array.
  - The `map()` function executes without errors, resulting in no calls to `LBGAnalytics.correlations.add()`, and no data is sent to the analytics system.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Missing Global Object**: If `LBGAnalytics` is not defined or improperly configured, the extension will not function as intended.
- **Empty Basket Handling**: It operates silently without throwing errors for empty states, which might lead to confusion when monitoring analytics outputs.
- **Conflict with Other Extensions**: If other extensions manipulate or override the `LBGAnalytics` object, it may lead to unpredictable behaviour or failures.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Code Structure**: While this code is compact, consider modularising the functionality for better readability and maintainability. For example, creating utility functions to handle basket retrieval and data correlation could improve clarity.
- **Logging**: Adding logging statements can provide insights during development and troubleshooting phases.
- **Error Handling**: Implement checks or error handling for cases when the basket data is not formatted as expected or in case of absent attributes.
- **Documenting Assumptions**: Clearly document the expectations for the `LBGAnalytics` object and its methods to prevent misuse by other developers.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ownership**: Designate a team or individual responsible for maintaining this extension, ensuring they are informed of any changes to the LBGAnalytics API or structure.
- **Testing Guidelines**: Implement automated tests to check the functionality with both populated and empty baskets to ensure consistent behaviour.
- **Documentation Updates**: Review and update this documentation periodically, especially when major changes are made to the analytics implementation or related extensions.
