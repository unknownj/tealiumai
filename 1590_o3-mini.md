# Basket Bits Tealium iQ Extension Documentation

This document provides a detailed overview, code explanation, usage examples, limitations, and recommendations for the "Basket Bits" extension implemented in Tealium iQ.

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Basket Bits  
- **ID:** 1590  
- **Type:** Advanced Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** Before Load Rules  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Always  

### Summary

The Basket Bits extension is designed to process items contained in a basket (retrieved from a global analytics object) and add each item as a correlation with a specific eVar value (evar32) to a predefined container (represented by the numeric identifier 610). This process is executed on every page load (or event) before any load rules are applied, ensuring that basket data correlations are updated early in the execution flow.

---

## 2. Code Explanation

### Structure and Execution

- The code is wrapped in an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE), with two parameters (`a` and `b`), which are passed `eventType` and `eventPayload` respectively.  
- Although `eventType` and `eventPayload` are supplied by Tealium, they are not directly used within the extension's logic.

### Key Operations

1. **Retrieving Basket Items:**  
   - The code calls `LBGAnalytics.basket.get()` to retrieve the basket items.  
   - It is assumed that this method returns an array of items.

2. **Mapping Through Items:**
   - The returned basket array is processed using the `.map()` function.  
   - For each item in the basket, the code executes a callback function.

3. **Adding Correlations:**
   - Inside the `.map()` callback, each item is added to correlations using  
     `LBGAnalytics.correlations.add({evar32: item}, [610]);`
   - This method call attaches the item value to `evar32` and associates this correlation with the container identified by 610.

### Dependencies and Global Objects

- **LBGAnalytics:**  
  The extension relies on the global `LBGAnalytics` object to access both the basket and correlations functionalities.  
- **basket and correlations:**  
  It is assumed that `LBGAnalytics.basket.get` and `LBGAnalytics.correlations.add` are defined and available during the execution of this code.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Scenario

- **Scenario:** A userâ€™s basket contains items such as "item1", "item2", and "item3".  
- **Data Flow:**
  1. `LBGAnalytics.basket.get()` retrieves the array: ["item1", "item2", "item3"].
  2. The `.map()` function iterates over each item.
  3. For each item, `LBGAnalytics.correlations.add({evar32: <item>}, [610]);` is called.
- **Result:**  
  - The correlation for "item1" is added under evar32 in container 610.
  - The same process is repeated for "item2" and "item3".

### Edge Conditions

- **Empty Basket:**  
  - If `LBGAnalytics.basket.get()` returns an empty array, the `.map()` function will execute zero iterations.  
  - **Outcome:** No correlations will be added, which is the expected behaviour for an empty basket.
  
- **Non-Array Response:**  
  - If `LBGAnalytics.basket.get()` were to return a non-array type (unlikely if implemented correctly), the `.map()` function could fail.  
  - **Outcome:** An error might be thrown when trying to use `.map()`. This situation would require additional handling elsewhere in the codebase or in the Tealium configuration.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Dependence on Global Object:**  
  The extension depends on the global `LBGAnalytics` object. If `LBGAnalytics`, `LBGAnalytics.basket`, or `LBGAnalytics.correlations` are not defined or are altered by other extensions or scripts, the extension may fail silently or throw errors.

- **Assumption of Valid Return Type:**  
  The code assumes that `LBGAnalytics.basket.get()` returns an array. If this method ever returns a different data type, the subsequent `.map()` operation will fail.

- **Fixed Correlation Key & Container:**  
  The extension always maps item values to `evar32` and associates them with container 610. Any changes to these values would require code modifications.

- **No Error Handling:**  
  There is no error handling provided within the extension. Any failures (for instance, if adding a correlation fails) will not be captured or logged.

- **Potential Interference with Other Extensions:**  
  Since the extension runs "Before Load Rules," if other extensions modify the global `LBGAnalytics` object later in the execution process, unexpected behaviours might occur. Coordination with other team members is recommended to ensure compatibility.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Validation of Returned Data:**  
  Although it is noted that defensive coding for `eventType` and `eventPayload` is not required, consider verifying that `LBGAnalytics.basket.get()` returns an array before using `.map()`. This can further reinforce the reliability of the code, especially if future changes occur.

- **Modularisation:**  
  For maintainability, consider abstracting the correlation addition into a separate function. This would make future updates (such as changing the eVar or container value) simpler and more manageable.

- **Error Handling & Logging:**  
  Introducing simple try/catch blocks or logging could help diagnose issues in a production environment, especially when dealing with external dependencies. Note, however, that extensive defensive coding should be balanced with the performance requirements of your implementation.

- **Comments & Documentation:**  
  Although inline comments are present, additional documentation within the code (explaining the purpose of specific method calls) can be beneficial for future developers who may work on the extension.

- **Maintain ES5 Compliance:**  
  Ensure any refactoring maintains ES5 compatibility. Avoid using ES2015/ES6 features such as arrow functions, template literals, or let/const declarations.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  - Regularly verify that the global `LBGAnalytics` object and its methods (`basket.get` and `correlations.add`) remain consistent with expectations across updates to the analytics platform.
  - Monitor for any changes in how basket items are structured or how correlations should be handled, ensuring that the extension is updated accordingly.

- **Ownership:**  
  - Clearly assign ownership of the extension documentation and code to ensure accountability for future modifications.
  - Maintain version control records and update the documentation whenever changes are made.

- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Include unit and integration tests that simulate various basket conditions (e.g. valid arrays, empty arrays, and unexpected data types) to ensure that the extension behaves as expected.
  - Test the extension in isolation to confirm that it correctly adds correlations and check for any conflicts with other Tealium extensions.

- **Collaboration:**  
  - Discuss any planned changes with stakeholders and other developers to avoid conflicts, especially when modifying global objects or key analytics tracking mechanisms.
  - Consider a review process for future updates to the extension to ensure continued compliance with best practices and business requirements.
