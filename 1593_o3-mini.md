# Adobe Virtual Pageviews Extension Documentation

This document provides a detailed overview and explanation of the Adobe Virtual Pageviews Tealium iQ extension, including its purpose, inner workings, usage examples, known limitations, and recommendations for future improvements. This guide is intended for developers and stakeholders involved in managing or maintaining this extension.

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Adobe Virtual Pageviews  
- **ID:** 1593  
- **Extension ID:** 100040  
- **Type:** Advanced Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** After Load Rules  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Always  

**Summary:**  
The Adobe Virtual Pageviews extension is designed to integrate with Adobe Target’s triggerView functionality. It facilitates the invocation of virtual pageview events, ensuring that pageviews are appropriately recorded under different scenarios (e.g. journey steps or landing pages). The extension dynamically constructs the view name using data from the event payload or from the DOM, checks for duplicate events, and utilises a history log for troubleshooting and reuse.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Global Objects and Dependencies
- **window.adobe.target:**  
  The extension relies on Adobe Target's `triggerView` function. It checks that this object and method exist on the window object before attempting any action.

- **LBGAnalytics and LBGAnalytics.cookies:**  
  An existing global object (`LBGAnalytics`) is extended with a `triggerView` property. This object includes utility methods for handling cookies, history, and event logging. The code assumes that `LBGAnalytics` and, optionally, `LBGAnalytics.cookies` are available and correctly set up.

### Key Variables and Methods

- **LBGAnalytics.triggerView Object:**  
  This object encapsulates all logic regarding the virtual pageview operations. Its key methods include:

  - **triggerViewAvailable:**  
    Checks for the existence of `window.adobe.target` and ensures that the `triggerView` method is a function.  
    _Logic Flow:_  
    Returns `true` if Adobe Target's `triggerView` is available; otherwise, it returns `false`.

  - **triggerViewDisabled:**  
    Determines if the trigger view functionality is disabled by checking a cookie named "triggerViewDisabled".  
    _Logic Flow:_  
    If `LBGAnalytics.cookies` is available, it uses its `getItem` method; otherwise, it parses `document.cookie`.

  - **disable(cookieDuration):**  
    Sets a cookie (`triggerViewDisabled=true`) for a specified duration to temporarily disable the trigger view functionality.  
    _Logic Flow:_  
    Either uses `LBGAnalytics.cookies.setItem` or directly sets `document.cookie` with an expiry.

  - **enable:**  
    Re-enables the trigger view functionality by removing the disabling cookie.  
    _Logic Flow:_  
    Uses `LBGAnalytics.cookies.removeItem` if available, or sets the cookie expiry to clear it.

  - **history:**  
    An array used to maintain a log of view names that have been triggered, which helps to avoid duplicate events unless explicitly forced.

  - **invoke(viewName, immediate, suppressHistory, forceDuplicate):**  
    The primary method to trigger a virtual pageview event.  
    _Logic Flow:_
    - Checks if Adobe Target's `triggerView` is available and not disabled.
    - Determines whether an event is a duplicate (comparing the last view in the `history` array).
    - Based on the `immediate` flag:
      - If `true`, it calls `triggerView` immediately.
      - Otherwise, it utilises `setTimeout` to introduce a slight delay.
    - Optionally logs events in `LBGAnalytics.target.events` (if this property exists) to support event chronological tracking.
    - Maintains a history of triggered view names unless `suppressHistory` is `true`.

  - **replay(viewName):**  
    A convenience method that simply calls `invoke` with the `immediate` and `suppressHistory` flags set to `true`.

### Event Entry Point and Conditional Logic

- The enclosing self-invoking function is invoked with two parameters: `eventType` and `eventPayload`. These parameters are used to determine the context in which the extension should run.

- **Conditional Scenarios:**  
  1. **Journey-based Trigger:**  
     If `eventType` equals "view" and the `eventPayload` contains both `JourneyName` and `JourneyStepName`, the extension concatenates these values (separated by a period) to form the `viewName` and then invokes the triggerView.
  
  2. **Landing Page Trigger:**  
     If the current `window.location.pathname` contains `"landingpage/landingPage.jsp"`, the extension looks for the first `<h1>` element within an element with the class `landingPage`. If found, it triggers a view with a `viewName` based on the text content of the `<h1>`, prefixed by "Landing Page.".

---

## 3. Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Journey-Based Virtual Pageview
- **Input Data:**  
  eventType = "view"  
  eventPayload = { JourneyName: "Checkout", JourneyStepName: "Payment" }

- **Process:**  
  - The extension forms the view name as "Checkout.Payment" (after trimming).
  - It checks if Adobe Target's `triggerView` is available and not disabled.
  - Calls the `invoke` method to log events and trigger the view (either immediately or queued, based on the immediate parameter).

- **Outcome:**  
  Adobe Target receives a `triggerView` call with "Checkout.Payment", and the event is logged in the history.

### Scenario 2: Landing Page Virtual Pageview
- **Condition:**  
  The user navigates to a URL that includes "landingpage/landingPage.jsp".

- **DOM Structure Assumption:**  
  The landing page contains an element with class `landingPage` and an `<h1>` inside it, e.g.:
  <pre>
  &lt;div class="landingPage"&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Welcome&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  </pre>

- **Process:**  
  - The extension detects the URL pattern.
  - It queries for the first `<h1>` inside the `.landingPage` container.
  - Formulates the view name as "Landing Page.Welcome" (with trimming applied).
  - Invokes the `triggerView` immediately.

- **Outcome:**  
  Adobe Target receives a `triggerView` call with "Landing Page.Welcome".

### Normal vs. Edge Conditions
- **Normal Condition:**  
  Adobe Target is fully available, and both journey and landing page conditions trigger appropriate virtual pageviews.

- **Edge Condition:**  
  If Adobe Target’s `triggerView` is not available (or if the trigger view is disabled via cookie), the code silently skips the trigger. Additionally, duplicate events are avoided unless the `forceDuplicate` flag is set to `true`.

---

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Dependency on Adobe Target:**  
  The extension will only function if `window.adobe` and `window.adobe.target.triggerView` are available. If these objects aren’t loaded or are delayed, the triggerView functionality will not execute.

- **Cookie Usage:**  
  The extension relies on cookies to disable or enable trigger views. Variations in cookie behaviour (based on browser settings or third-party cookie restrictions) could impact this feature.

- **Duplicate Event Handling:**  
  The history array prevents duplicate triggers if the same view name is passed consecutively. However, in scenarios where duplicate events are intentional, the `forceDuplicate` parameter must be carefully managed.

- **DOM Dependency for Landing Pages:**  
  The landing page functionality depends on the existence of a `.landingPage h1` selector. If the markup changes or if the selector is not found, no virtual pageview will be triggered.

- **Conflicts with Other Extensions:**  
  Since the extension extends a global object (`LBGAnalytics`), naming collisions or modifications in other Tealium extensions that interact with `LBGAnalytics` or modify its cookies functionality could cause unintended behaviour.

---

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks and Error Handling:**  
  Although it is guaranteed that `eventType` and `eventPayload` exist, consider adding more safeguards for external object references (other than the provided ones) to make the extension more robust against changes in global objects like `LBGAnalytics` or `document.cookie`.

- **Modularisation:**  
  Split the code into smaller, more modular functions. For example, separate the cookie handling functions into their own module to enhance clarity and ease future modifications.

- **Code Comments:**  
  Increase inline comments to detail the purpose of each logic block. This will improve readability and ease maintenance for future developers.

- **Logging Enhancements:**  
  Consider standardising event logging within the extension so that developers can more easily trace the sequence of actions in the history array.

- **Separation of Concerns:**  
  Moving the DOM query used for landing pages into a separate function may facilitate testing and modification should the page structure change in the future.

- **Maintain ES5 Compliance:**  
  Continue using ES5 syntax practices (function declarations, var) to keep compatibility with legacy browsers. Avoid any ES6+ constructs.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  - Regularly verify that the global dependencies (e.g. Adobe Target, LBGAnalytics) remain consistent with the expected structure.
  - Monitor changes in the DOM structure of landing pages or any other pages that utilise this extension.
  - Test the extension with new versions of Adobe Target to ensure continued compatibility.

- **Ownership:**  
  Clearly document the team responsible for maintaining the `LBGAnalytics` namespace and its related utilities, as this extension depends heavily on those global objects.

- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Include unit tests for each method under `LBGAnalytics.triggerView` to validate that triggerView events are correctly queued, invoked, and logged.
  - Simulate different conditions (e.g. disabled cookie, missing Adobe Target, duplicate events) to ensure that edge cases are handled gracefully.
  - Include integration tests on landing pages to validate that the DOM queries and view name creation work as intended.

- **Documentation Updates:**  
  As further enhancements are made, update this documentation to reflect any changes in the functionality or integration points with other systems.
