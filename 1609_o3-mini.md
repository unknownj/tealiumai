# Event Stream Data Mappings Extension Documentation

This document provides an in-depth overview, explanation, usage examples, known limitations, recommendations, and maintenance notes for the "Event Stream Data Mappings" extension.

---

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Event Stream Data Mappings  
- **ID:** 100036  
- **Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** 1459  
- **Execution Frequency:** Invoked on every event payload processing (each event that triggers the extension)  

**Summary:**  
This extension processes your event payload by filtering out unwanted variables while ensuring that key marketing and tracking information is always included. In essence, it maintains a whitelist of variables (and variable prefixes) that should be passed to the Event Stream. When marketing consent is not present (as indicated by the "CookiesTargeting" flag), it removes sensitive variables from the payload. The code also includes logic to automatically add additional variables from an Adobe Analytics tag if present.

---

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables

- **eventStreamVariables:**  
  A base array containing the names of variables that should always be mapped to the Event Stream. It includes variables such as "cp.trace_id", "cp._ga", "click_id", and others.

- **eventStreamVariablePrefixes:**  
  An array of key prefixes. Any payload variable whose name starts with one of these prefixes is added to the mapping list. This ensures that dynamically named variables or additional tracking variables are captured.

- **eventStreamCMVariableRemoves:**  
  An array of variable names that are removed from the payload in cases where marketing consent is not granted (i.e. when b["CookiesTargeting"] is not true). This list includes sensitive identifiers like "AccountID", "CustomerGender", "FacebookPixelID", etc.

### Logic Flow

1. **Initial Setup:**  
   The extension immediately executes in an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) that receives the global event variables: eventType, eventPayload, and tagObject (aliased as b in the code).

2. **Collecting Default Variables:**  
   The `eventStreamVariables` array is populated with pre-defined variable names that should always be available. These variables are intended to pass through to the Event Stream.

3. **Adding Adobe Analytics Variables:**  
   A try-catch block attempts to read variable names from an Adobe Analytics tag (if available) by iterating over the keys in `utag.sender[928].map`. Any found variable names get added to `eventStreamVariables`.

4. **Adding Based on Prefix Matching:**  
   A second try-catch block:
   - Retrieves a list of variable names present in the event payload.
   - Checks each variable against the list of prefixes (`eventStreamVariablePrefixes`).
   - If a variable name starts with one of these prefixes, it is added to the `eventStreamVariables` list.

5. **Filtering the Payload:**  
   The code loops through every property of the event payload. If a variable is not present in the compiled `eventStreamVariables` list, it is removed (deleted) from the event payload.

6. **Consent Mode Filtering:**  
   The extension checks for marketing consent using `b["CookiesTargeting"]`:
   - If consent is not true, a secondary deletion loop removes any variables from the payload that appear in the `eventStreamCMVariableRemoves` list.

7. **Presentation Family:**  
   Finally, it ensures that `b.PresentationFamily` is set to "Web" if it is not already defined.

### Dependencies and Global Objects

- **utag.sender[928]:**  
  The extension optionally depends on an Adobe Analytics tag present in utag.sender. If this tag is not available, the code handles the exception gracefully.

- **Event Payload (eventPayload):**  
  The payload is expected to be an object with key/value pairs. The extension assumes this object is always provided.

- **CookiesTargeting (b["CookiesTargeting"]):**  
  This property is used to determine whether marketing consent is present.

- **Other Globals:**  
  The code uses standard ES5 JavaScript objects and functions. No external libraries are required apart from the ones provided by Tealium.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Operation Scenario

**Input:**  
An event payload containing the following variables:

{
  "cp.trace_id": "1234",
  "click_id": "abcd",
  "non_matching_key": "value",
  "FacebookUser": "user123",
  "CustomerGender": "female"
}

- The code always maps "cp.trace_id" and "click_id".
- Because "FacebookUser" starts with "Facebook" (a recognised prefix), it is added.
- "non_matching_key" is not whitelisted and is removed.
- If marketing consent (CookiesTargeting) is granted (true), "CustomerGender" may be retained if added by the default or prefix list. If added otherwise, it could be filtered by the subsequent logic; however, if no consent is given, then "CustomerGender" falls under the sensitive variables list in eventStreamCMVariableRemoves and gets deleted.

**Output:**  
With consent given:

{
  "cp.trace_id": "1234",
  "click_id": "abcd",
  "FacebookUser": "user123",
  "CustomerGender": "female"   // May be present if found in earlier lists
}

Without consent (CookiesTargeting !== true):

{
  "cp.trace_id": "1234",
  "click_id": "abcd",
  "FacebookUser": "user123"
  // "CustomerGender" is removed for privacy reasons
}

### Edge Condition Scenario

- If the Adobe Analytics tag (utag.sender[928].map) is not present, an exception is caught and the mapping continues without those additional variables.
- Similarly, if a variable is not present in the payload, or if there are no matches based on prefix filtering, the try-catch safeguards prevent any disruption in the mapping process.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Dependency on Adobe Analytics Tag:**  
  The extension attempts to augment the mapping with variables from utag.sender[928].map. If this tag is absent or misconfigured, the extra variables will not be added.

- **Ordering of Extensions:**  
  If other Tealium or custom extensions manipulate the event payload either before or after this extension runs, it may inadvertently affect the payload. Ensure correct extension ordering to avoid conflicts.

- **Consent Logic Assumption:**  
  The consent check strictly depends on the b["CookiesTargeting"] flag being set to true or not. If the consent mechanism changes or if other consent flags are used, the code may require adjustments.

- **ES5 Compliance:**  
  The extension is written in ES5. While this ensures backwards compatibility, it lacks some of the modern language features that could make the code more readable and maintainable.

---

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Modularisation:**  
  Consider breaking the code into smaller functions for the following tasks:
  - Extracting and merging whitelist variables.
  - Filtering the event payload based on the whitelist.
  - Handling marketing consent and sensitive data removal.
  
  Modular code aids in testing and future enhancements.

- **Defensive Checks:**  
  While eventType and eventPayload are guaranteed to be available, additional checks may be useful when handling utag.sender arrays or during interactions with external tags to prevent unexpected runtime errors.

- **Code Style Improvements:**  
  Although ES5 constraints apply, you can still introduce improvements in variable naming and inline commenting to enhance maintainability. For example, consistently use proper scoping (using var) and avoid accidental global reassignments.

- **Documentation Comments:**  
  Increasing inline comments explaining complex sections (e.g. the filtering loops) could aid future developers in understanding the code at a glance.

- **Testing Enhancements:**  
  Introduce unit tests for each function (if modularised) to ensure that payload filtering behaves as expected under various scenarios.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  The arrays (eventStreamVariables, eventStreamVariablePrefixes, and eventStreamCMVariableRemoves) are central to the extension's functionality. Review these lists periodically to ensure they remain accurate with evolving tracking needs and privacy regulations.

- **Ownership:**  
  Assign an owner or team for this extension to handle updates, bug fixes, and enhancements. Ensure that documentation remains updated alongside any code changes.

- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  Regularly test the extension within staging environments using sample payloads to verify that:
  - Only the expected whitelisted variables are passed through.
  - Sensitive variables are correctly removed when marketing consent is not provided.
  - No unintended side-effects occur when interacting with other extensions.

- **Change Log & Versioning:**  
  Keep a detailed changelog within the source repository to document any changes or improvements that are made, along with reasons for the changes.
