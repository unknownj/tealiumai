# Event Stream cfg Hack Documentation

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Event Stream cfg Hack  
- **Extension ID:** 100036  
- **Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** 1459  
- **Execution Frequency:** Executed on every event load (via the IIFE in the Tealium iQ tag lifecycle)  

**Summary:**  
This extension intercepts and overrides the native protocol validation function (validateProtocol) within the Tealium tag configuration. Its primary purpose is to inject a runtime configuration override that ensures the property "loader.cfg" (if present) is cleared before the standard protocol validation occurs. This prevents tag completion statuses from being inadvertently sent to EventStream, aligning with a specific use-case requirement.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables & Structure

- **Input Parameters:**  
  The outermost immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) is defined with three parameters:  
  • `a` (eventType)  
  • `b` (eventPayload)  
  • `u` (tagObject)  

- **Inner IIFE:**  
  The inner IIFE accepts a parameter `tagConfigObject`, which is assigned the value of `u` (the tag object). This object holds configurations and runtime functions for the tag.

### Logic Flow

1. **Legacy Function Check:**  
   The code first checks whether `tagConfigObject.validateProtocol_legacy` is already defined.  
   - If not defined, it stores the original `validateProtocol` function in `validateProtocol_legacy`.

2. **Function Override:**  
   The extension then overrides `tagConfigObject.validateProtocol` with a new function. This new function performs the following:
   - **Override 1:**  
     Checks if `tagConfigObject.data` exists and whether it has a property named `"loader.cfg"`.  
     - If the property exists, it resets its value to an empty object (`{}`). This effectively clears any configuration that might otherwise send tag completion statuses to EventStream.
   - **Invocation of Legacy Function:**  
     Calls and returns the result from the original `validateProtocol_legacy` function with the provided `address` and `force_ssl` parameters.

### Dependencies

- **Global / External Objects:**  
  The extension assumes the presence of the following objects passed to the outer IIFE:
  - `eventType` (as a string): Represents the type of event triggering the extension.
  - `eventPayload` (as an object): Contains the data associated with the event.
  - `tagObject` (as an object): Represents the current tag configuration, including functions such as validateProtocol.
  
- **Tealium iQ Runtime:**  
  This script relies on the standard Tealium iQ tag lifecycle and its internal configuration objects.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Condition

**Scenario:**  
A tag is set to validate an address with `force_ssl` applied.  
- **Input:**  
  • `tagConfigObject.data` includes a `loader.cfg` property with valid configuration data.  
- **Process:**  
  The overridden `validateProtocol` checks for the `loader.cfg` and resets it to an empty object before calling the original function.  
- **Output:**  
  The address is validated normally while ensuring that no completion statuses are sent to EventStream.

### Edge Condition

**Scenario:**  
The `tagConfigObject.data` object is present but does not have the `loader.cfg` property.  
- **Input:**  
  • `tagConfigObject.data` might exist, but there is no `"loader.cfg"` key.  
- **Process:**  
  The check passes without making any changes. The code calls the original `validateProtocol_legacy` function seamlessly.  
- **Output:**  
  The validation proceeds normally without any intervention since there is no `loader.cfg` to clear.

### Alternative Scenario

**Scenario:**  
The overridden function is executed a second time during the tag lifecycle.  
- **Condition:**  
  If `validateProtocol_legacy` is already defined, the inner IIFE block does not override it again.  
- **Output:**  
  The extension ensures that the override logic is applied only once, maintaining consistency across multiple executions.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Single-Time Override:**  
  The logic to store the legacy `validateProtocol` is guarded by a check (`if (typeof tagConfigObject.validateProtocol_legacy !== "function")`).  
  - If another extension or script has already altered this function by setting `validateProtocol_legacy`, this code may not be executed, potentially resulting in inconsistent behaviour.

- **Dependency on Tag Data Structure:**  
  The extension strictly relies on `tagConfigObject.data` structure and the existence (or potential existence) of `"loader.cfg"`.  
  - If the structure is altered or depleted by other scripts, the intended override may not execute as expected.

- **Potential Conflicts:**  
  If other Tealium extensions also attempt to modify `validateProtocol` or its properties, there might be conflicts causing unpredictable tag behaviour.

- **Debugging Complexity:**  
  Since the extension overrides a core validation function, debugging validation issues may become more complex if multiple overrides occur.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks for Data Structure:**  
  Although the user guarantees the presence of certain objects (e.g., eventType, eventPayload), consider adding additional checks around `tagConfigObject.data` to prevent runtime errors if the object's structure is modified unexpectedly by other extensions.
  
- **Modularisation of Overrides:**  
  For improved clarity and maintenance:
  - Extract the override logic into a clearly named helper function within the IIFE. This would improve readability by separating the restore of the legacy function from the override logic.
  
- **Clear Documentation and Comments:**  
  Maintain thorough inline comments to explain the purpose of each code segment.  
  - Ensure that the documentation stays updated if any part of the logic changes.

- **Robust Fallback Strategies:**  
  Include fallback strategies or logging mechanisms for debugging, especially if the `validateProtocol` override does not behave as expected in certain scenarios.

- **ES5 Adherence:**  
  Continue to use ES5 syntax (avoiding ES2015 features such as arrow functions, let/const, and template literals) to ensure compatibility across environments using older JavaScript engines.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Testing:**  
  - Establish automated tests to simulate both normal and edge case scenarios to ensure that the override behaves as expected.
  - Test across various tag configurations to prevent regressions.

- **Change Ownership:**  
  - Assign a dedicated maintainer for this extension to manage updates, ensuring that all changes are verified against production use cases.
  
- **Version Control:**  
  - Track changes to the extension in version control (e.g., Git) alongside the Tealium iQ container to maintain a clear revision history.
  
- **Logging & Error Handling:**  
  - Although traditional error handling is not included, consider adding basic logging for debugging purposes during development and regression testing.
  
- **Stakeholder Communication:**  
  - Prepare clear documentation (similar to this page) to inform stakeholders about the changes in behaviour due to this override, especially in cases where other event stream functionalities might be affected.
