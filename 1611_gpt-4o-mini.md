# Application State Events Extension Documentation

## 1. Extension Overview
- **Name**: Application State Events
- **ID**: 100036
- **Type**: JavaScript Code
- **Scope**: Before Load Rules
- **Execution Frequency**: Run Always

### Summary
The "Application State Events" extension is designed to capture and handle different application states in a web application. It specifically tracks events related to the application's lifecycle, allowing for analytics to observe user interactions with different states. By capturing these states, marketers and analysts can make informed decisions about user engagement and application performance.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- `a`: Represents the event type that triggers the execution of this extension.
- `b`: Represents the event payload that contains application state information and potentially other relevant data.
- `aState`: The current application state fetched from `b.ApplicationState`.

### Logic Flow
1. The extension checks if `LBGAnalytics.asTracker` is defined and is not already tracking the current `aState`.
2. If `LBGAnalytics.asTracker` isn't defined, it initializes it with the current `aState`.
3. If `LBGAnalytics.asTracker` is present and doesn't include the newly received `aState`, it pushes `aState` to the tracker.
4. Next, it checks if `b.JourneyUniqueID` is not present. If true, it calls `LBGAnalytics.events.genericEvent(x)` for specific states ("Application", "Offered", "Fulfilled", "Referred", "Declined"), sending different event IDs based on the state.
5. Regardless of the previous checks, it always triggers a generic event with ID `407`.

### Dependencies
The extension relies on:
- `LBGAnalytics`: A global object assumed to have properties and methods for managing analytics states and events. Specifically, it accesses:
  - `asTracker`: An array that keeps track of application states.
  - `events.genericEvent(x)`: A function that records specific events by ID.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Conditions
- As a user navigates through different states of the application (e.g., "Application", "Offered", etc.), the extension captures these states and triggers relevant events.
- If the user transitions from "Application" to "Offered", both states will be logged in `LBGAnalytics.asTracker`, and event ID `29` (for "Offered") will be triggered.

### Edge Conditions
- If the user transitions to a state that is already logged in `LBGAnalytics.asTracker` (e.g., goes from "Offered" back to "Offered"), no new state is pushed, preventing duplication.
- If the `JourneyUniqueID` is present, none of the specific state events will fire, and only event ID `407` will trigger indicating a state update.

---

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas
- The extension does not handle the case where `LBGAnalytics` is not defined, which could lead to runtime errors if the analytics library fails to load.
- If another extension or script modifies `LBGAnalytics`, it could lead to unexpected behaviour, such as missing events or incorrect state logging.
- Events are only triggered if `b.JourneyUniqueID` is absent, which may not align with all business requirements, potentially leading to missed tracking opportunities.

---

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring
- **Defensive Checks**: Introduce checks to confirm that `b.ApplicationState` is valid before attempting to process it.
- **Modularity**: Consider breaking down the logic for triggering events into separate functions for better readability and maintainability.
- **Code Style**: Ensure consistent variable naming and structure, possibly using explanatory comments to clarify the purpose of each segment, leading to enhanced readability.
- **Error Handling**: Although not required by the specifications, consider implementing basic error logging to capture any unexpected conditions, such as preventing event tracking if `LBGAnalytics` is unavailable.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes
- **Ownership**: Assign a dedicated team member for ongoing maintenance of the extension, ensuring they are familiar with both JavaScript and analytics requirements.
- **Testing Guidelines**: Regularly verify that the extension functions correctly with different application states, particularly after updates to LBGAnalytics or other interdependent scripts.
- **Documentation Updates**: Make sure to update this documentation as enhancements or changes are made to the extension, keeping all stakeholders informed of any impacts on tracking and reporting.
