# Application State Events Extension Documentation

This document provides a detailed explanation of the Application State Events extension. It covers the extension overview, code explanation, usage examples, known limitations, refactoring recommendations, and maintenance notes.

---

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Application State Events  
- **ID:** 1611  
- **Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** Before Load Rules  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Always  

**Summary:**  
This extension is designed to track and process state changes within an application. When an application state is detected (stored on the event payload), the extension adds the state to a global tracker (if not already present) and conditionally fires specific generic events via the LBGAnalytics framework. This enables the analytics system to track different states such as "Application", "Offered", "Fulfilled", "Referred", and "Declined". Additionally, a common event (event code 407) is dispatched on state change to provide a general signal that the application’s state has transitioned.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables and Global Dependencies

- **a (eventType):** Although not used explicitly in this code snippet, it represents the type of event received.
- **b (eventPayload):** An object that is expected to contain the property `ApplicationState` along with other potential identifiers like `JourneyUniqueID`.
- **aState:** A local variable that stores the current application state (i.e. `b.ApplicationState`).
- **LBGAnalytics:** A global object expected to exist in the environment.  
  - `LBGAnalytics.asTracker` is used to collect states that have already been tracked.
  - `LBGAnalytics.events.genericEvent()` is the method invoked to send generic event codes.

### Logic Flow

1. **Initial Assignment:**  
   The code extracts `ApplicationState` from the eventPayload and assigns it to `aState`.

2. **First Condition – Initial Tracker Setup:**  
   - Checks if `LBGAnalytics.asTracker` is undefined (it does not exist yet) and if a valid `aState` is provided.
   - If so, it initialises the tracker as an array containing the current `aState`.

3. **Second Condition – Tracking New States:**  
   - If `LBGAnalytics.asTracker` already exists, and the current `aState` is defined but not already in the tracker array (i.e. `indexOf(aState) < 0`), the new state is appended to `LBGAnalytics.asTracker`.
   - **Conditional Event Firing:**  
     - It first checks if the `JourneyUniqueID` property is not present on the event payload. If absent, it fires specific generic events based on the value of `aState`:
       - If `aState` is "Application", it fires generic event 28.
       - If `aState` is "Offered", it fires generic event 29.
       - If `aState` is "Fulfilled", it fires generic event 30.
       - If `aState` is "Referred", it fires generic event 31.
       - If `aState` is "Declined", it fires generic event 32.
   - Regardless of the above condition, generic event 407 is always fired after updating the tracker.

### Dependencies & External Objects

- **Global Object Dependency:**  
  The extension relies on the global `LBGAnalytics` object for both state tracking (via `asTracker`) and event dispatching (via the `genericEvent` method).

- **Tealium iQ Environment:**  
  The code is executed within Tealium iQ with the expectation that valid `eventType` (string) and `eventPayload` (object) parameters are provided.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Scenario

- **Scenario:**  
  A visitor completes an action that sets the `ApplicationState` to "Application" without a `JourneyUniqueID`.
  
- **Data Flow:**  
  - `b.ApplicationState` is set to "Application".
  - Since `LBGAnalytics.asTracker` has not been initialised, it gets initialised with `["Application"]`.
  - Because there is no `JourneyUniqueID`, generic event 28 is fired.
  - Finally, generic event 407 is fired to indicate a state change.

### Repeated State Change

- **Scenario:**  
  The same visitor triggers another event with the same `ApplicationState` value ("Application").
  
- **Data Flow:**  
  - The code detects that "Application" is already present in `LBGAnalytics.asTracker`.
  - No repeated state-specific event is fired (i.e. generic event 28, 29, etc. are skipped).
  - Only generic event 407 is fired.

### New State with Journey Identifier Present

- **Scenario:**  
  A different state, say "Offered", is introduced but with a `JourneyUniqueID` present in the event payload.
  
- **Data Flow:**  
  - "Offered" is not yet in the tracker, so it gets added.
  - Since `JourneyUniqueID` is present, the conditional block that dispatches specific generic events for "Offered" is skipped.
  - Nevertheless, generic event 407 is still triggered.

### Edge Condition – No ApplicationState

- **Scenario:**  
  The event payload does not provide an `ApplicationState`.
  
- **Data Flow:**  
  - The variable `aState` remains undefined.
  - The extension does not perform any further processing.
  - No tracker updates or events will occur.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Dependence on Global Objects:**  
  The extension assumes the existence of a correctly defined `LBGAnalytics` global object along with the required methods and properties. Absence or misconfiguration of this global object will cause the extension to fail.

- **Hardcoded Event Mappings:**  
  The generic events (28, 29, 30, 31, 32, and 407) are hardcoded. Any changes to event codes or state names require modifying the code.

- **Execution Order Sensitivity:**  
  Since the extension runs "Before Load Rules", any subsequent modifications to the global `LBGAnalytics` object after this extension runs might negate or conflict with the set tracking.

- **No Defensive Coding for External Dependencies:**  
  While the extension guarantees that `eventType` and `eventPayload` are provided, it does not check for the existence of `LBGAnalytics`. This might create issues if `LBGAnalytics` is unexpectedly undefined.

---

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Modularisation:**
  - Consider abstracting the logic that maps the state strings to the corresponding event codes into a separate function or lookup object. This would reduce repetitive code and simplify future updates if event codes change.

- **Defensive Checks:**
  - Although not required for `eventType` and `eventPayload`, it is advisable to perform early checks or fail gracefully if `LBGAnalytics` is not defined.
  
- **Code Comments:**
  - Include inline comments to explain the purpose of key conditional blocks, especially the rationale behind firing event 407 after each state update.
  
- **DRY Principle:**
  - The conditional firing of specific generic events based on the state value could be refactored into a loop or lookup table to avoid multiple if-statements.
  
- **Error Handling:**
  - Implement try/catch blocks around calls to external methods like `LBGAnalytics.events.genericEvent` to capture any unexpected errors without breaking the execution of subsequent code.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**
  - Regularly review and test the extension in staging environments when deploying updates to the analytics framework or Tealium iQ configuration.
  - If new application states are introduced, update the extension’s logic to handle these new states appropriately.
  
- **Ownership and Versioning:**
  - Ensure proper version control is applied to the extension code within your Tealium iQ environment.
  - Document any changes as part of your release notes to keep stakeholders informed of modifications.

- **Testing Guidelines:**
  - Create unit tests that simulate events with various `ApplicationState` values, with and without the `JourneyUniqueID`.
  - Test for scenarios where `LBGAnalytics` might be absent or misconfigured to ensure proper error handling is in place.
  - Confirm that the `LBGAnalytics.asTracker` array accurately tracks states without duplications.

- **Further Documentation:**
  - If possible, include external documentation links (e.g., to the LBGAnalytics API or Tealium iQ guidelines) to provide additional context for developers unfamiliar with the broader system.
