# Bucketed Journey Amount Extension Documentation

## Extension Overview
- **Name**: Bucketed Journey Amount
- **ID**: 1615
- **Type**: Javascript Code
- **Scope**: After Load Rules
- **Execution Frequency**: Run Always

### Summary
The "Bucketed Journey Amount" extension processes a numerical or string representation of a journey amount and formats it into a bucketed representation. Specifically, it transforms the input into a format that comprises only relevant digits and places zeros for other less significant figures. This is particularly useful for analytics and reporting, ensuring a consistent data format across varying input values.

## Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- **getReportingNumber**: A function designed to process a number (or string that represents a number) and format it according to specific rules:
  - It uses `toLocaleString` to ensure the number has two decimal places and is represented in British English.
  - The formatted number is then manipulated by replacing all but the two most significant digits (and the decimal point) with zeros.

### Logic Flow
1. The extension begins by defining a function `getReportingNumber` to perform the formatting of the Journey Amount.
2. It checks the type of `b.JourneyAmount` to confirm it is either a string or number.
3. If valid, it processes `b.JourneyAmount` through the `getReportingNumber` function to generate the formatted value.
4. Finally, it assigns the result to `b.JourneyAmountBucketed`.
   
### Dependencies
- This extension relies on the global objects `eventType` and `eventPayload` provided by the Tealium environment. Additionally, it assumes that `b.JourneyAmount` is present either as a string or number, with no external libraries required.

## Usage Examples

### Normal Condition
If `b.JourneyAmount` is set to `12345.67`:
- The output `b.JourneyAmountBucketed` would yield a value formatted as `12345.00`.

### Edge Conditions
1. If `b.JourneyAmount` is a string:  
   Input: `"5000.1234"`  
   Output: `5000.00`  
   The function trims the decimal places to maintain two decimals.

2. If `b.JourneyAmount` has fewer significant figures:  
   Input: `50`  
   Output: `50.00`  
   The function adds two decimal places.

3. If `b.JourneyAmount` is invalid (e.g., a string that cannot be converted to a number, such as `"abc"`):
   Output: `b.JourneyAmountBucketed` would not be set.

## Known Limitations & Gotchas
- The extension does not handle non-numeric strings gracefully. If parsing fails (due to unexpected characters), it results in `b.JourneyAmountBucketed` being undefined.
- If the formatted journey amount exceeds the precision handling of the `Number` type in JavaScript, potential inaccuracies may arise.
- There might be conflicts with other extensions that manipulate `b.JourneyAmount`, leading to unintended consequences in the order of execution.

## Recommendations for Refactoring
- **Code Structure**: Consider making `getReportingNumber` a standalone modular function outside the IIFE for better readability and potential reuse.
- **Variable Naming**: Use clearer variable names for better code clarity, e.g., `journeyAmount` instead of `number` inside the `map` function.
- **Defensive Programming**: Although checks on `eventType` and `eventPayload` are unnecessary, consider adding explicit type checks for `b.JourneyAmount` before processing to enhance robustness.
  
```javascript
var getReportingNumber = function(amount) {
  // Processing logic...
};
```

## Maintenance & Further Notes
- **Ownership**: Assign a team member responsible for maintaining this extension, ensuring knowledge transfer within the team.
- **Testing Guidelines**: Incorporate unit tests covering both valid inputs and edge cases. Ensure the extension is re-tested following any changes or upgrades within the Tealium platform.
- **Documentation Updates**: Regularly review and update this documentation as the requirements evolve or as the extension undergoes changes.
