# Bucketed Journey Amount Extension Documentation

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name**: Bucketed Journey Amount  
- **ID**: 1615 (Extension Instance ID)  
- **Extension Type**: Javascript Code  
- **Scope**: After Load Rules  
- **Execution Frequency**: Run Always  

**Summary**:  
This extension transforms the value present in the property "JourneyAmount" into a numeric format with two fixed decimal places, then processes the string representation of this number. Specifically, after formatting using the British locale, it replaces all characters after the third position (except the decimal point) with zeros. The output is stored in "JourneyAmountBucketed". This bucketed value can later be used for reporting or segmentation where rounded buckets are desired.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables and Their Purpose

- **eventType**: The first parameter passed into the immediately invoked function expression (IIFE). Although its value is not utilised within the extension, it is provided as part of the Tealium event workflow.  
- **eventPayload**: The second parameter that holds the event data. This object is expected to contain the "JourneyAmount" property and will eventually be updated with the "JourneyAmountBucketed" property.

- **getReportingNumber (Function)**:  
  This local function takes an input (`number`) and performs the following steps:  
  1. **Parsing**: Converts the input to a floating point number using `parseFloat()`.  
  2. **Formatting**: Uses the `toLocaleString()` method with the British English locale (`'en-GB'`) to ensure the number has exactly two decimal places.  
  3. **String Manipulation**:  
     - Removes any commas from the formatted number string.  
     - Splits the string into an array of characters.  
     - Uses the `map()` function to iterate over each character; any character with an index greater than 2 (after the first three characters) is replaced with "0", unless that character is a decimal point (".").  
     - Joins the array back into a string for the final bucketed value.  
  4. **Error Handling**: Should any error occur during processing, the function will catch it and return `NaN`.

### Logic Flow

1. **Input Check**:  
   The code checks whether the `JourneyAmount` property in the `eventPayload` object is of type "string" or "number". This ensures that only valid numeric or numeric string values are further processed.

2. **Data Processing**:  
   - If `JourneyAmount` is valid, it is passed into the `getReportingNumber` function.  
   - The function tries to parse, format, and then map the formatted output into a bucketed format.  
   - The code then verifies that the output is not `NaN`.

3. **Output Assignment**:  
   - If the transformed number is valid (i.e. not `NaN`), it assigns the resultant value to a new property on the `eventPayload` object: `JourneyAmountBucketed`.

### Dependencies

- **Global Objects**:  
  This extension relies on two globally available parameters (`eventType` and `eventPayload`) guaranteed by Tealium.  
- **ES5 Methods**:  
  The code exclusively uses ES5 compatible methods such as `parseFloat()`, `toLocaleString()`, `split()`, `map()`, and `join()`, ensuring broad browser compatibility.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Example 1 – Standard Numeric Input

- **Input**:  
  `eventPayload.JourneyAmount = "1234.56";`  
- **Processing**:  
  - `parseFloat("1234.56")` returns 1234.56.
  - The number is then formatted to "1,234.56" (subject to locale formatting).
  - After removing commas, the string becomes "1234.56".
  - The mapping function will leave the first three characters intact ("1", "2", "3") and replace subsequent characters (except the decimal point) with "0".
- **Output**:  
  `eventPayload.JourneyAmountBucketed` might result in a value such as "123000" (depending on the precise behaviour of mapping; note that the decimal is preserved but characters after the third digit are replaced with "0").

### Example 2 – Numeric Input as a Number

- **Input**:  
  `eventPayload.JourneyAmount = 9876.54;`  
- **Processing**:  
  - Using `parseFloat(9876.54)` yields 9876.54.
  - After formatting (e.g. "9,876.54"), the process strips commas, then transforms the string based on the defined mapping.
- **Output**:  
  A bucketed version of the number, stored as `eventPayload.JourneyAmountBucketed`, ensuring standardized formatting for reporting purposes.

### Example 3 – Edge Case: Non-numeric String

- **Input**:  
  `eventPayload.JourneyAmount = "not a number";`  
- **Processing**:  
  - `parseFloat("not a number")` returns `NaN`.
  - The `getReportingNumber` function catches this and returns `NaN`.
- **Output**:  
  Since `isNaN(getReportingNumber(b.JourneyAmount))` is true, the property `JourneyAmountBucketed` is not added to the eventPayload.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Input Format Sensitivity**:  
  The extension assumes that the `JourneyAmount` value can be successfully processed by `parseFloat()`. Unconventional numeric formats may lead to unexpected results or `NaN`.

- **Rigid Mapping Logic**:  
  Characters beyond the third position are indiscriminately replaced with "0" (except for the decimal point). This behaviour might not be suitable for all reporting requirements and may lead to loss of precision.

- **Locale Dependence**:  
  The use of `toLocaleString('en-GB', {...})` ensures British formatting. However, discrepancies in formatting behaviour across different browsers or environments could affect the output string.

- **Potential Conflicts**:  
  If other extensions or external scripts attempt to manipulate `JourneyAmount` or `JourneyAmountBucketed`, there may be unexpected overwrites or conflicts in data processing.

- **Error Handling**:  
  The broad try/catch within `getReportingNumber` may obscure specific exceptions, making troubleshooting harder if unexpected inputs or environmental conditions occur.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Modularisation and Readability**:  
  Consider breaking the mapping logic into smaller helper functions to improve readability and testability.

- **Defensive Type-Checks**:  
  While the availability of `eventType` and `eventPayload` is guaranteed, additional checks on `JourneyAmount` could provide clearer error handling and debugging (if future modifications or integrations alter expected behaviour).

- **Detailed Logging**:  
  Although not currently required, introducing logging when an unexpected value is encountered (i.e. when conversion results in `NaN`) can help with debugging in complex deployments.

- **Commenting**:  
  Enhance in-line comments to fully explain the transformation logic (especially the character mapping). This can assist future developers in understanding the rationale behind the bucketed format.

- **Unit Testing**:  
  Implement a suite of unit tests specifically for the `getReportingNumber` function to cover normal, boundary, and edge cases. This aids in catching any future regressions should the logic evolve.

*Note: All recommendations preserve ES5 compatibility, ensuring the extension remains supportable across all target environments.*

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Version Control**:  
  Ensure that any modifications to this extension are tracked through a version control system, including descriptive commit messages that detail the reasoning behind changes.

- **Testing Guidelines**:  
  Develop thorough test cases covering various representations and values of `JourneyAmount`. This should include typical numeric strings, numbers, and misformatted strings to ensure that the extension behaves as expected in all scenarios.

- **Documentation Updates**:  
  Keep this documentation updated as changes are made to the extension. If modifications to logic or additional features are introduced, ensure that the documentation reflects those updates.

- **Ownership and Review**:  
  Assign an owner for the extension who is responsible for regular reviews and quality assurance checks. Peer reviews on code changes are recommended to maintain code quality.

- **Integration Considerations**:  
  Prioritise compatibility with other Tealium iQ extensions, particularly those that may use the `JourneyAmount` field. Consistent naming conventions and clear documentation of field usage can help avoid conflicts.
