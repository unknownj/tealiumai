# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: Set Mapp Brand ID

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Set Mapp Brand ID
- **ID:** 1616 (Extension Instance), 100036 (Extension Metadata ID)
- **Type:** Javascript Code
- **Scope:** 1460
- **Execution Frequency:** Runs on every event where the extension is loaded (as per Tealium configuration)

**Summary:**  
This extension assigns a Mapp Brand ID to an event's payload based on the value of the "Brand" property. It utilises a lookup (hard-coded within the extension) to map recognised brand names (e.g. "Lloyds", "Halifax", "BOS") to their corresponding Mapp Brand IDs. This is useful for ensuring that the payload includes a standardised identifier for the brand, which can then be used for further processing or analytics downstream.

## 2. Code Explanation

**Key Variables:**

- `mappBrandLookup`:  
  An object that acts as a lookup table containing a set of brand-to-ID mappings.  
  Example mappings:
  - "Lloyds" maps to "206"
  - "Halifax" maps to "207"
  - "BOS" maps to "208"

- `a`, `b`, `u`:  
  Parameters of the anonymous function representing `eventType`, `eventPayload`, and `tagObject` respectively.  
  - `a` (eventType): A string representing the event type.
  - `b` (eventPayload): An object containing the event's payload, including various properties.
  - `u` (tagObject): Represents the associated tag configuration which may include extra details if needed.

**Logic Flow:**

1. The function is immediately invoked with the parameters `eventType`, `eventPayload`, and `tagObject`.

2. Within the function, the `mappBrandLookup` object is defined to map known brand names to their respective Mapp Brand IDs.

3. The code checks if the `Brand` property in the payload (`b.Brand`) exists in the `mappBrandLookup`.  
   - If a mapping exists (i.e. the brand is recognised), then `b.MappBrandID` is set to the corresponding value from the lookup table.

**Global Dependencies:**

- The extension depends on the availability of the global objects or parameters `eventType`, `eventPayload`, and `tagObject` provided by Tealium iQ.
- There are no external libraries referenced; the code is self-contained and written in plain ES5-compliant JavaScript.

## 3. Usage Examples

**Scenario 1: Valid Brand Mapping**

- **Input:**  
  eventPayload = { Brand: "Lloyds" }  
- **Processing:**  
  The code checks `mappBrandLookup["Lloyds"]` and finds the value "206".  
- **Output:**  
  The eventPayload is updated to include:  
  MappBrandID: "206"  

**Scenario 2: Unrecognised Brand**

- **Input:**  
  eventPayload = { Brand: "UnknownBrand" }  
- **Processing:**  
  Since "UnknownBrand" is not defined in `mappBrandLookup`, the condition fails, and no action is taken.  
- **Output:**  
  The eventPayload remains unchanged without a MappBrandID property.

**Scenario 3: Missing Brand Property**

- **Input:**  
  eventPayload = { }  
- **Processing:**  
  Because `b.Brand` is undefined, the lookup condition does not pass.  
- **Output:**  
  The eventPayload remains unchanged without a MappBrandID property.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Strict Matching:**  
  The lookup is case-sensitive as defined. For example, "lloyds" (lowercase) will not match "Lloyds".
  
- **Hard-Coded Mappings:**  
  Any additions or changes to brand mappings require direct code modifications and redeployment of the extension.
  
- **Limited Error Handling:**  
  There is no provision for logging or error handling if an unexpected situation occurs (e.g. brand property is present but not in the expected format).

- **Potential Conflicts:**  
  If another Tealium extension modifies the same `eventPayload` and sets a different MappBrandID, this could lead to unintended overwrites.  
  Ensure that the order of execution for extensions is properly managed to avoid conflicts.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks and Logging:**  
  Although the availability of inputs is guaranteed for this specific context, consider including logging for unsupported brands or unexpected values to aid debugging in future iterations.

- **Code Modularity:**  
  Encapsulate the lookup logic in a separate function if additional transformations will be required in similar contexts. This allows for easier unit testing and future code reuse.

- **Configuration Driven:**  
  In scenarios where brand mappings are subject to change, consider moving the `mappBrandLookup` data outside of the code (e.g. via a JSON configuration file or Tealium Data Layer) to allow non-developers to update values without needing to adjust code.

- **Documentation:**  
  Add inline comments to explain the purpose of variables and logic, especially for developers who might work on the extension in the future.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ownership:**  
  Ensure that the version control and documentation are maintained in a central repository (e.g. GitHub) and update the version number when making significant changes.

- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Regularly test with various eventPayload scenarios to ensure that both recognised and unrecognised brands are processed as expected.
  - Consider automated tests that simulate event payloads and verify that the MappBrandID is only set when appropriate.
  
- **Change Management:**  
  - Document any changes or additions in the extension's changelog.
  - Review the extension periodically, especially if the list of supported brands is updated.

- **Collaboration:**  
  Encourage peer reviews for modifications to the extension, as the simplicity of the logic may lead to overlooked edge cases when new mappings are introduced.

This documentation should provide a clear reference for developers and stakeholders to understand, maintain, and enhance the "Set Mapp Brand ID" Tealium iQ extension.
