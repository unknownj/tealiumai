# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name**: Abort Event Stream tag on defer event
- **ID**: 1617
- **Type**: Javascript Code
- **Scope**: 1459
- **Execution Frequency**: On specific events (view, link)

### Summary
This extension is designed to prevent processing of certain tags within the Tealium iQ Event Stream based on the event type. Specifically, it allows for the conditional bypassing of tags if the event type does not match 'view' or 'link'. This helps ensure that only relevant data is sent under specific circumstances, improving overall data accuracy and performance.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- **eventType**: A string representing the type of the event being processed (e.g., 'view', 'link').
- **eventPayload**: An object representing the data associated with the event.
- **tagObject**: The object that holds information about the tag being executed (not explicitly used in the logic).

### Logic Flow
1. The function checks the value of `eventType`.
2. If `eventType` is neither 'view' nor 'link', the function returns `false`, effectively aborting the execution of the Event Stream tag.
3. If `eventType` is 'view' or 'link', the function allows the tag to continue processing (although this part is not actively coded).

### Global Dependencies
- The function relies on globally available variables `eventType`, `eventPayload`, and `tagObject` which are provided by the Tealium iQ environment when the extension is triggered.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Standard Operation
- **Input**: `eventType = 'view'`
- **Output**: The extension allows the tag to process normally, as the condition for processing is met.

### Scenario 2: Abort Condition
- **Input**: `eventType = 'customEvent'`
- **Output**: The extension returns `false`, preventing the tag from executing.

### Edge Condition: No Type Match
- **Input**: `eventType = 'link'`
- **Output**: The tag continues processing.
  
### Edge Condition: Unrecognized event type
- **Input**: `eventType = 'unknownEvent'`
- **Output**: The extension aborts processing.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Limited Event Types**: Currently, the extension only checks for 'view' and 'link'. Any other event types will lead to an abort, which may not be desirable if additional event types need to be handled in the future.
- **Dependency on Event Type**: If the `eventType` variable is not accurately set prior to the extension execution, this could lead to unintended behaviour.
- **Conflict with Other Extensions**: If other extensions attempt to manipulate event handling based on the same event types, conflicts may arise resulting in inconsistent data payloads.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Code Clarity**: The ternary operator can be used for better readability. However, as ES5 needs to be supported, the current structure should remain as is.
- **Expand Functionality**: Consider expanding the logic to handle additional event types or make the conditions dynamic to enhance flexibility.
- **Modularisation**: Distributing the logic in separate functions (e.g., a function to evaluate the event type) can improve maintainability and testability.
- **Documentation**: Inline comments can be added to clarify the purpose of major sections of the code for future developers.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

### Ongoing Maintenance
- Regularly review the usage of this extension to ensure it continues to meet requirements as new event types and data structures evolve.
- Document any changes made to adjacent extensions that could affect this extension's functionality.

### Ownership
- Assign a team member to take responsibility for maintenance and periodic review of the extension performance.

### Testing Guidelines
- Conduct regular functional tests to ensure the extension behaves as expected with multiple event types â€“ including legitimate and edge cases.
- Reassess the extension's impact whenever major updates are made to other connected extensions or the Tealium iQ platform.
