# Abort Event Stream Tag on Defer Event Extension

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Abort Event Stream tag on defer event  
- **ID:** 1617  
- **Extension Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** 1459  
- **Execution Frequency:**  
  - The extension executes on every event, but it immediately returns without processing if the event type is not "view" or "link".  
  - In practise, it only proceeds when the event type is either a "view" or a "link" event.

### Summary

This extension is designed to abort the processing of the Event Stream tag when the event type does not meet the accepted criteria (i.e. "view" or "link" events). Essentially, its purpose is to prevent non-standard events from triggering the event stream tag, ensuring that only the desired (or primary) events pass through. This is useful in scenarios where you want to defer or filter out events that could lead to unwanted or erroneous data being sent.

## 2. Code Explanation

The code consists of a self-invoking function that takes three parameters:

- **Variables/Parameters:**
  - `a` (assigned from `eventType`): Expected to be a string holding the type of event (e.g. "view" or "link").
  - `b` (assigned from `eventPayload`): Expected to be an object containing the event’s payload data.
  - `u` (assigned from `tagObject`): Typically provides context about the tag being executed.  

- **Logic Flow:**
  1. **Input Check:**  
     The function first checks whether the value of `a` (i.e. the event type) is exactly equal to the string `"view"` or `"link"`.
  2. **Conditional Exit:**  
     If the event type does not match either `"view"` or `"link"`, the function immediately exits by returning `false`.  
     - This return value can be used by Tealium iQ to determine whether the tag action should continue or be aborted.
  3. **No Further Processing:**  
     If the event type does match `"view"` or `"link"`, no additional code is executed—implying that the default behavior (or subsequent logic outside this snippet) is allowed to proceed.

- **Dependencies:**
  - The code relies on three global or externally provided variables: `eventType`, `eventPayload`, and `tagObject`.  
  - There is an implicit dependency on Tealium iQ’s execution environment, which ensures these variables are defined and available.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Condition: "view" or "link" Event

- **Input:**  
  - eventType: "view"  
  - eventPayload: { someData: "example" }  
  - tagObject: { tagName: "EventStream" }
  
- **Behaviour:**  
  Since the event type is "view", the condition check passes. The function does not return `false` and thereby allows the Event Stream tag to continue its intended processing.

### Edge Condition: Non-Matching Event Type

- **Input:**  
  - eventType: "click" (or any other value not equal to "view" or "link")  
  - eventPayload: { someData: "example" }  
  - tagObject: { tagName: "EventStream" }
  
- **Behaviour:**  
  The condition (`if(a !== "view" && a !== "link")`) evaluates to `true`, causing the function to immediately execute `return false`. This action prevents the Event Stream tag from processing this event further.

### Additional Scenario – Undefined Non-Standard Event Types

- **Input:**  
  - eventType: "custom_event"  
  - eventPayload: {}  
  - tagObject: {}  
  
- **Behaviour:**  
  As “custom_event” does not satisfy the criteria for "view" or "link", the function returns `false`. This implementation acts as a guard clause to filter out non-standard events.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Hard-Coded Logic:**  
  The extension only explicitly checks for the string values `"view"` and `"link"`. Any future expansion of valid event types will require manual updating of this condition.
  
- **Return Value Handling:**  
  The significance of returning `false` is presumed to be interpreted correctly by Tealium iQ’s event system. Misinterpretation or conflicts with other custom return value expectations may lead to unexpected behaviour.
  
- **Potential Conflicts:**  
  - If other Tealium extensions apply modifications or cancellation logic based on the return value of event processing, there is a risk of conflict.
  - External scripts or extensions altering `eventType` or similar global objects may inadvertently affect this extension's behaviour.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Coding Enhancements:**  
  Although `eventType` (string) and `eventPayload` (object) are guaranteed, consider additional logging or error tracking for easier debugging when unexpected event types occur.
  
- **Modularisation:**  
  If more complex logic is incorporated in the future, break down the functionality into smaller functions that can be individually unit tested.
  
- **Code Style:**  
  - Retain ES5 syntax to support legacy browsers.  
  - Maintain clear variable naming and inline comments for clarity.
  - Consider explicitly commenting on the purpose of the return `false` to aid maintainers in understanding its importance.
  
- **Testing Improvements:**  
  Introduce unit tests or manual test cases for each branch (i.e. when eventType is "view", "link", and an unrecognised value).

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**
  - Regularly review the conditions that determine which events are permitted.  
  - Ensure compatibility with any updates to Tealium iQ or associated libraries.  
  - Maintain a changelog if modifications to the extension logic are made.

- **Ownership:**
  - Designate a responsible team member or group for monitoring extension performance and logging, especially in environments with high event volumes.
  
- **Testing Guidelines:**
  - Implement periodic manual tests simulating various event types.
  - Validate that the tag is consistently aborted when non-"view" or non-"link" events occur, and that correct events are processed without delay.
  - Integrate with any continuous integration (CI) systems if possible, to run tests on code changes.

- **Documentation Updates:**  
  - Update this documentation page whenever significant changes are made to the code or business requirements.
  - Use version control for the documentation alongside the code to track updates and rationales for changes.
