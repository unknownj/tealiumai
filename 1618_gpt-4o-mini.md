# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: Hatch Cookie Override

## 1. Extension Overview
- **Name**: Hatch Cookie Override
- **ID**: 1618
- **Type**: Javascript Code
- **Scope**: Pre Loader
- **Execution Frequency**: Run Once

### Summary
The "Hatch Cookie Override" extension is designed to set specific cookies for users visiting certain URLs on a website. It specifically targets paths related to youth student bank accounts and a help guidance page. By manipulating the cookies, this extension aims to manage user experience and consent regarding tracking.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- **`hatch`**: A boolean variable that determines whether the cookies should be set. It is initially false and is set to true if the page URL matches specified conditions.

### Logic Flow
1. The code initializes the `hatch` variable to `false`.
2. It checks if the current page URL starts with the path `/bankaccounts/youth-student-accounts/` or exactly matches `/savings/help-guidance/saving-explained/score-your-first-job.html`.
3. If either condition is met, `hatch` is set to `true`.
4. If `hatch` is `true`, two cookies, `OPTOUTMULTI` and `OPTOUTMULTIMESSAGE`, are created with specific values and a path of `/`.

### Dependencies
- The extension relies on the global `window` object for obtaining the current URL via `window.location.pathname`.
- No external libraries are utilized.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Flow
- When a user navigates to `https://example.com/bankaccounts/youth-student-accounts/`, the extension checks the URL and finds a match. Consequently, it sets the cookies:
  - `document.cookie = "OPTOUTMULTI=0:0|c1:1|c3:0|c5:1|c4:1|c2:0; path=/;"`
  - `document.cookie = "OPTOUTMULTIMESSAGE=1; path=/;"`

### Edge Conditions
- If a user visits a non-matching path, such as `https://example.com/home`, the `hatch` variable remains `false`, and no cookies are set.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas
- The extension only triggers once per page load due to the "Run Once" frequency, which may lead to missed opportunities to set cookies under certain user navigation patterns (e.g., page refresh or navigation via external links).
- Cookies will not be set on URLs not specified in the conditions, which may not account for all relevant pages.
- There may be potential conflicts with other extensions or scripts that manipulate cookies, leading to unintended overwrites or behaviours.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring
- **Modularisation**: Consider wrapping the logic in a function that can be reused or tested independently.
- **Defensive Checks**: Although it is guaranteed that `eventType` and `eventPayload` are present, additional checks could be implemented to ensure `window.location` is accessible.
- **Code Commenting**: Inline comments could be added to clarify each step of the logic for future developers reviewing the code.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes
- **Ownership**: Designate an owner responsible for monitoring the extension's performance and any requisite updates.
- **Testing Guidelines**: Regularly test the extension across all target URLs to ensure proper functionality and cookie setting.
- **Documentation Updates**: Ensure this documentation is reviewed and updated whenever changes to the extension code occur or if additional conditions are added.

This documentation serves as a comprehensive reference for understanding the Hatch Cookie Override extension, its functionalities, limitations, and recommendations for future development.
