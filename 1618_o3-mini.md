# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: Hatch Cookie Override

This document provides a comprehensive overview and explanation of the "Hatch Cookie Override" extension implemented in Tealium iQ. It covers the extension's purpose, code logic, sample use cases, limitations, and recommendations for future improvements.

---

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Hatch Cookie Override  
- **ID:** 1618  
- **Extension Type:** Javascript Code (Pre Loader)  
- **Scope:** Pre Loader  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Once  

**Summary:**  
The Hatch Cookie Override extension is designed to conditionally set specific cookies on web pages. It inspects the current URL (using `window.location.pathname`) and, if the URL matches one of the defined criteria, it sets two cookies:  
- `OPTOUTMULTI` is assigned a value of `"0:0|c1:1|c3:0|c5:1|c4:1|c2:0"`.  
- `OPTOUTMULTIMESSAGE` is assigned a value of `1`.  

These cookies are likely used elsewhere in the website to control content or tracking preferences based on user activity in selected sections of the site.

## 2. Code Explanation

The extension code is structured as follows:

1. **Initialisation:**  
   - A variable named `hatch` is declared and initialised to `false`. This variable acts as a flag to determine whether the cookie override should be applied.

2. **Conditional Checks on URL Path:**  
   - The code then checks the global `window.location.pathname` against two specific URL conditions:
     - **Condition 1:**  
       - Checks if the pathname starts with `"/bankaccounts/youth-student-accounts/"` using `indexOf` and ensuring the index is `0`.
     - **Condition 2:**  
       - Compares the pathname for an exact match against `"/savings/help-guidance/saving-explained/score-your-first-job.html"`.
   - If either condition evaluates to true, the `hatch` flag is set to `true`.

3. **Cookie Setting:**  
   - When `hatch` is true, two cookies are set:
     - **OPTOUTMULTI Cookie:**  
       - The cookie is assigned a value of `"0:0|c1:1|c3:0|c5:1|c4:1|c2:0"` and its path is set to `/`.  
     - **OPTOUTMULTIMESSAGE Cookie:**  
       - The cookie is assigned a value of `"1"` and its path is set to `/`.
     
4. **Dependencies on Global Objects:**  
   - The code relies on the global `window` object for obtaining the current pathname via `window.location.pathname`.
   - It uses the `document.cookie` API to set browser cookies.

5. **Execution Context:**  
   - The extension is executed in the Pre Loader phase and is configured to run only once, ensuring these cookies are not repeatedly modified.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Matching Youth or Student Accounts Page
- **URL Example:**  
  `https://www.example.com/bankaccounts/youth-student-accounts/account-details`
- **Process:**  
  - The pathname starts with `"/bankaccounts/youth-student-accounts/"`.
  - The `hatch` flag is set to true.
  - Both `OPTOUTMULTI` and `OPTOUTMULTIMESSAGE` cookies are set.
- **Outcome:**  
  The userâ€™s session will include the override cookies, possibly affecting tracking or content display for youth/student account helper pages.

### Scenario 2: Matching the Saving Explained Page
- **URL Example:**  
  `https://www.example.com/savings/help-guidance/saving-explained/score-your-first-job.html`
- **Process:**  
  - The pathname exactly matches the defined route.
  - The flag `hatch` becomes true.
  - The cookies are set as specified.
- **Outcome:**  
  The cookie settings are applied ensuring that users on the "score your first job" page receive the intended user experience.

### Scenario 3: Non-Matching Paths
- **URL Example:**  
  `https://www.example.com/savings/calculators/`
- **Process:**  
  - The pathname does not match any of the conditions.
  - The `hatch` flag remains false.
  - No cookies are set.
- **Outcome:**  
  Since none of the conditions are met, the extension does not alter cookie behaviour, and the default settings remain intact.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Hard-Coded URL Paths:**  
  - The extension checks for very specific URL patterns. Any changes in the URL structure could cause the override logic to fail or miss the intended pages.
  
- **Exact String Matching:**  
  - The second condition employs an exact string comparison (`==`). A minor variation in the URL (e.g., trailing slash differences or case sensitivity) might result in the flag not being set.
  
- **Cookie Overwriting:**  
  - As this is a "Run Once" script on a Pre Loader, any later extensions or scripts that manipulate the same cookies (`OPTOUTMULTI` and `OPTOUTMULTIMESSAGE`) may override these values if not managed correctly.
  
- **Dependency on Global Objects:**  
  - The logic deeply relies on `window.location.pathname` being in the expected format. If the global object is altered or if the code is executed in an environment without a window (such as server-side rendering), errors may occur.
  
- **Conflict Risks:**  
  - There might be potential conflicts with other Tealium extensions or external scripts that attempt to set or modify the same cookies.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks:**  
  - Although the eventType and eventPayload are guaranteed to be available, consider wrapping the URL condition checks or the cookie setting in try/catch blocks to safeguard against any unforeseen issues.
  
- **Modularisation:**  
  - Extract the code for matching URL conditions into a helper function. This increases readability and makes it easier to update the conditions in the future.
  
- **Documentation and Logging:**  
  - Add comments or logging statements (using a legacy-compatible method such as `console.log`) that trace which URL condition was met for debugging purposes.
  
- **Parameterisation:**  
  - Consider externalising the URL patterns and cookie values so they can be more easily updated without modifying the code directly.
  
- **Code Style Consistency:**  
  - Stick to the ES5 syntax guidelines. Ensure all variable declarations use `var` and that the function definitions and conditional statements maintain consistent indentation and style for better readability.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Testing:**  
  - Regularly test the extension in a staging environment whenever URL structures are updated. Verify that the cookie values remain consistent with the business logic.
  
- **Ownership and Version Control:**  
  - Ensure that changes to this extension are tracked through version control. Assign a specific developer or team to oversee modifications and coordinate JavaScript code reviews.
  
- **Documentation Updates:**  
  - Update this document as changes are made to the extension logic or as new requirements arise.
  
- **Monitoring and Logging:**  
  - If possible, add monitoring tools that can report when the extension is triggered and when cookies are set to ensure any unexpected behaviour is quickly identified.
  
- **Dependencies Check:**  
  - Schedule periodic checks to ensure that changes in the platform (or browser updates) do not impact the reliance on `window.location` or `document.cookie` functions.

This documentation should serve as a comprehensive guide for developers and stakeholders to understand, maintain, and improve the Hatch Cookie Override extension in Tealium iQ.
