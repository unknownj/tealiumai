# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name**: Grab data from utag_data if we're missing it
- **ID**: 1620
- **Type**: Javascript Code
- **Scope**: Before Load Rules
- **Execution Frequency**: Run Always

### Summary

This extension is designed to enhance data integrity during the data layer population process. It checks if certain data points are missing in the `eventPayload` (the object that carries data for the specific event). If the `JourneyName` property is absent and if the current page's URL matches certain criteria, the extension will populate the `eventPayload` with data from `utag_data`. This ensures that all relevant data is collected, preventing data loss during tracking.

---

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables

- **`window.utag_data`**: A global object storing data related to the current page, which may include properties such as `JourneyName`.
- **`eventType`**: A string representing the type of event being tracked. This is passed as an argument to the IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression).
- **`eventPayload`**: An object that holds the data for the specific event. It is modified in place if necessary.

### Logic Flow

1. The code checks if the `utag_data` object exists and if the `JourneyName` within it is defined.
2. If `JourneyName` is missing in `eventPayload` or if the URL contains "applypca", the extension loops through `utag_data`.
3. During the loop, if a key from `utag_data` is not already present in `eventPayload`, it adds that key and its corresponding value to `eventPayload`.

### Processing Data

The extension ensures that for any key-value pair in `utag_data`, if it is not already defined in `eventPayload`, it will be copied over. This functionality is essential for collecting relevant browsing or user journey information that may not be explicitly sent with the event.

### Dependencies

- This extension relies on the global `window` object, specifically the `utag_data` variable that must be defined prior to this code execution. It assumes that `utag_data` is populated by other parts of the Tealium system.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Operation

Suppose a user navigates to a page where the `utag_data` object contains:
```javascript
utag_data = {
    JourneyName: "Homepage",
    UserId: "12345"
}
```

If `eventPayload` at the time of invocation is:
```javascript
eventPayload = {
    UserId: null
}
```

After running the extension, the modified `eventPayload` will be:
```javascript
eventPayload = {
    UserId: "12345",
    JourneyName: "Homepage"
}
```

### Edge Conditions

- **Scenario 1**: If `eventPayload` already contains a value for `UserId`, no changes will be made, and it will remain:
```javascript
eventPayload = {
    UserId: "67890"
}
```
- **Scenario 2**: If the user is on a page whose path does not contain "applypca" and `JourneyName` is still missing in `eventPayload`, the extension will not run, and no data will be borrowed from `utag_data`.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Global Dependency**: If `utag_data` is not properly initialised before this extension runs, the code will not function as expected. This reliance on a global variable necessitates careful ordering of scripts in the Tealium configuration.
- **Overwriting Existing Data**: It can unintentionally overwrite properties in `eventPayload` if they are not already defined, altering the data sent to analytics.
- **Performance**: While this extension should execute efficiently, a large number of properties in `utag_data` could affect performance due to increased looping.

---

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks**: Although this extension assumes certain properties will be present, adding additional checks can prevent unexpected behaviours if future modifications are made.
- **Use of for-in Loop**: Consider adding a condition to check if `k` is a property of `utag_data` using `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call`, to avoid unintended inheritance issues.
- **Code Style**: Consistency in variable naming conventions could enhance readability. Adding comments to logical sections of the code can also provide clarity.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

### Ongoing Maintenance

- Regularly review and test the extension against updates to Tealium iQ and related configurations to ensure continued compatibility.
- Monitor the data being collected to ensure that the extension performs as expected.

### Ownership

- Designate a specific developer or team responsible for the ongoing support and enhancement of this extension.

### Testing Guidelines

- Establish a testing protocol to validate that the `eventPayload` receives the appropriate values under various scenarios.
- Ensure regression testing whenever changes are made to relevant data flows or dependencies.
