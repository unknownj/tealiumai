# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name**: Grab data from utag_data if we're missing it  
- **Extension ID**: 100036 (instance ID: 1620)  
- **Type**: Javascript Code  
- **Scope**: Before Load Rules  
- **Execution Frequency**: Run Always  

**Summary**:  
This extension checks if the global object "utag_data" exists along with its property "JourneyName". If the property "JourneyName" is found and the event payload (provided via the parameter "b") does not have "JourneyName", or if the URL pathname includes "applypca", the extension copies all properties from "utag_data" into the event payload. This ensures that required data is available in the event payload when it is missing, or for specific conditions based on the URL, enhancing data consistency within the Tealium workflow.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- **a (eventType)**: A parameter passed into the function representing the type of event. It is not directly used in the code.
- **b (eventPayload)**: An object that is expected to carry event-specific data. The extension uses this to check and set properties if necessary.
- **window.utag_data**: A global object provided by Tealium which may contain various data properties including "JourneyName".

### Logic Flow
1. **Condition Check**:
   - The code first verifies that `window.utag_data` exists.
   - It checks that `window.utag_data.JourneyName` is defined.
   - The condition then uses an OR logic:
     - Either the event payload (`b`) does not have the property "JourneyName".
     - Or the current document's URL pathname contains the string "applypca".
2. **Data Copying**:
   - If the above conditions are met, the extension iterates over every property in the `window.utag_data` object.
   - For each property `k`, if the event payload (`b`) does not already contain that property, it copies the value from `window.utag_data[k]` to `b[k]`.
3. **Execution**:
   - The function is executed immediately, ensuring the event payload is updated with any missing data before subsequent load rules or processing.

### Dependencies
- **Global Objects**:  
  - `window.utag_data` must be available in the global scope.
  - `window.location.pathname` is used to check the current URL.
- **Assured Parameters**:  
  - `eventType` and `eventPayload` are guaranteed to be present when the extension is executed.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Example Scenario 1: Standard Data Population
- **Context**:  
  - `window.utag_data` exists and contains `JourneyName = "Onboarding"`.  
  - The event payload (`eventPayload`) does not have a `JourneyName` property.
- **Behaviour**:  
  - The extension iterates through `window.utag_data` and copies `JourneyName` and any other properties into `eventPayload`.
  - Result: `eventPayload.JourneyName` becomes `"Onboarding"` and all missing properties are populated.

### Example Scenario 2: URL Overrides Data Checking
- **Context**:  
  - The URL pathname includes `"applypca"` (e.g. `/applypca/submit`).
  - Even if `eventPayload` already has a `JourneyName`, the condition related to the pathname is true.
- **Behaviour**:  
  - The extension will copy any properties from `utag_data` that are missing in the payload.
  - Result: Ensures that any missing data is filled even if some fields exist because of the specific URL condition.

### Example Scenario 3: Data Already Present
- **Context**:  
  - Both `window.utag_data` and `eventPayload` contain a valid `JourneyName`.
  - The URL pathname does not contain `"applypca"`.
- **Behaviour**:  
  - No copying occurs since `eventPayload` already has `JourneyName`.
  - Result: `eventPayload` remains unchanged, preserving any existing data.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Deep Copying**:  
  - The code performs a shallow copy of properties. If any values are objects themselves, only the reference is copied, not a deep clone.
  
- **Global Dependency on utag_data**:  
  - The extension relies on `window.utag_data` being available before it runs. If this object is not defined, the extension does nothing.
  
- **Potential Data Overwriting**:  
  - Although the code checks if a property already exists on `eventPayload`, if another extension or script modifies `eventPayload` later, conflicts could occur.
  
- **Edge Condition with URL Matching**:  
  - The condition involving `"applypca"` in the URL pathname will trigger the copying irrespective of whether `eventPayload.JourneyName` exists. This may lead to unintended duplication if not carefully monitored.

- **Interference with Other Extensions**:  
  - If other Tealium extensions modify `eventPayload` before or after this extension, the sequencing might affect the final payload values.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Modularisation**:  
  - Consider extracting the data merging logic into a separate function for clarity and potential reuse.

- **Enhanced Property Checks**:  
  - Although current checks are sufficient, additional logging or error handling (when running in a development environment) could help identify unexpected behaviour.

- **Documentation Comments**:  
  - Adding inline comments explaining each conditional check and loop iteration would improve future maintainability.
  
- **Testing with Different Data Structures**:  
  - Ensure that testing is performed with various shapes of `utag_data` and `eventPayload` objects to handle edge cases beyond the current implementation.
  
- **Preserve Property Order**:  
  - If order is important (and in case of dependency on specific sequences in the payload), consider the potential impact when properties are added.

*Note*: Do not add checks for the existence or type of `eventType` and `eventPayload` as they are guaranteed to be present and valid based on implementation standards.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance**:  
  - Regularly review the extension for changes in underlying global objects like `utag_data` or any modifications in how Tealium delivers data.
  
- **Owner and Versioning**:  
  - Assign a team member for ownership of this extension. Document any changes or updates within version control and update this documentation accordingly.
  
- **Testing Guidelines**:  
  - Use staging environments to test changes.
  - Create unit tests to simulate scenarios with and without `JourneyName` in both `utag_data` and `eventPayload`.
  - Pay special attention to URL conditions where `"applypca"` is part of the pathname.
  
- **Integration Checks**:  
  - Monitor the performance of this extension in production to ensure no conflicts arise with other data manipulation scripts.
  
- **Future Extensions**:  
  - As new data requirements emerge, consider refactoring with a view to more dynamically handling different source and target objects. Document any such changes clearly to maintain consistency with the current extension lifecycle and functionality.
