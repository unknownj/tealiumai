# Tealium iQ Extension: Documentation

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Consume utag_data if not done  
- **ID:** 1621 (ExtensionId: 100036)  
- **Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** Pre Loader  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Once  

### Summary
This extension is designed to perform two main tasks:  
1. Check whether the utag_data object on the page has already been “consumed” (i.e. processed by checking for a dummy property), and if not, mark it as consumed and trigger consumption using LBGAnalytics.  
2. Detect if the current page is being viewed in a webview by performing a series of checks on cookies, URL parameters, hostname properties, and DOM elements. If webview detection criteria are met, it sets a flag in the data layer and, after confirming the presence of a global nga_constants object, creates and sets an "OPTOUTMULTI" cookie based on GDPR-related consent data.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables & Objects
- **window.utag_data:** Global data object that may already exist on the page.
- **LBGAnalytics:** A global object assumed to manage analytics and the data layer. It contains helper methods such as:
  - `LBGAnalytics.datalayer.get(property)`
  - `LBGAnalytics.datalayer.consume(source, objectName)`
  - `LBGAnalytics.datalayer.set(property, value)`
  - `LBGAnalytics.cookies.getItem(name)`
  - `LBGAnalytics.cookies.defaultDomain`
- **webviewDetected:** Boolean flag initialised to false and updated based on several conditions for webview detection.
- **nga_constants:** Global object checked using the helper function `waitForObject`. When present, it is used to generate a consent cookie.

### Logic Flow
1. **utag_data Consumption Check:**
   - If the global `utag_data` exists, the code assigns a dummy property `__isconsumed__` with a value of true.
   - It then checks if this dummy property is already present in the analytics data layer.  
   - If not found, `LBGAnalytics.datalayer.consume(window, "utag_data")` is invoked to mark the consumption process.

2. **Webview Detection:**
   - The extension employs multiple `try-catch` blocks to test various conditions that indicate a webview environment.
   - **Testing Techniques:** Looks for the presence of a cookie ("tealiumngatestflag") or a hash value (`#donottrack`) in the URL.
   - **Legit Webview Pages:** Checks for conditions such as hostname starting with "api", query strings containing "nga=true", or URL patterns matching specific webview keys.
   - **Data Layer Conditions:** Looks into the data layer for properties "Presentation" equalling "NGA" or "Native" as well as an inferred check for "NativeCookie."
   - Additional conditions involve testing for the existence of global `nga_constants` or specific DOM elements when the pathname indicates a Sharedealing App.

3. **Updating the Data Layer:**
   - After evaluating various conditions, the final state of `webviewDetected` is set into the data layer using `LBGAnalytics.datalayer.set("WebviewDetected", webviewDetected)`.

4. **Waiting for nga_constants and Creating the Cookie:**
   - The helper function `waitForObject(window, "nga_constants", ngaToCookie, 500)` is used to delay cookie creation until `nga_constants` is available.
   - **ngaToCookie Function:**  
     - Checks for GDPR consent properties within `nga_constants`.
     - Converts these consent flags into a cookie string, with each cookie flag in the format key:value.
     - Sets an "OPTOUTMULTI" cookie with a 90-day expiry, ensuring that the domain and path are properly set.

### Dependencies
- The extension heavily relies on global objects `utag_data`, `LBGAnalytics`, and optionally `nga_constants`.
- It also depends on specific cookies and URL query parameters to determine behaviour.

---

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Behaviour
- **Scenario:** A webpage loads and has a properly populated `utag_data` object.
  - The extension will mark `utag_data.__isconsumed__` as true.
  - It then calls `LBGAnalytics.datalayer.consume(window, "utag_data")` if the dummy flag is not found in the data layer.
  - Webview detection is performed.  
    - For example, if the URL contains `nga=true` or a matching hostname (e.g. "api..."), then `webviewDetected` is set to true.
  - When `nga_constants` becomes available, a GDPR-based consent cookie ("OPTOUTMULTI") is set with a 90-day expiry.

### Edge Conditions
- **Missing utag_data:**  
  - If `utag_data` does not exist on the page, the consumption code is simply bypassed.
- **Webview Detection Failures:**  
  - If none of the prescribed conditions are met (e.g. missing specific cookies, URL patterns, or data layer values), `webviewDetected` remains false.
  - The `ngaToCookie` function will only be invoked if `webviewDetected` is true and the `nga_constants` object eventually becomes available.
- **Error Handling:**  
  - Most key operations are wrapped in `try-catch` blocks to prevent a single failure from breaking the subsequent processing.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Assumptions on Global Objects:**  
  - The code assumes that `LBGAnalytics` (and its methods) is already defined and available. If it is delayed or missing, parts of the functionality (such as data layer consumption and cookie handling) may fail.
- **Dependency on URL/DOM Structure:**  
  - The detection logic for a webview relies heavily on specific URL patterns and DOM elements. Changes in URL structures or HTML layouts could cause webview detection to fail.
- **Cookie Parsing and Setting:**  
  - The construction of the consent cookie ("OPTOUTMULTI") is strictly based on the structure of `nga_constants.gdpr`. Any changes to the structure of `nga_constants` may break the cookie logic.
- **Try-Catch Overuse:**  
  - While the try-catch blocks guarantee that the extension does not break the page if an error occurs, they might also mask underlying issues during debugging.
- **Potential Conflicts:**  
  - Extensions running in the Pre Loader and operating on global objects might interfere with other scripts modifying the same objects, especially if multiple extensions handle `utag_data` or similar global variables.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks & Robust Error Handling:**  
  - Although errors are caught, consider logging errors (if logging is available) to assist in debugging rather than silently eating exceptions.
- **Modularisation:**  
  - Break the webview detection logic and the cookie creation logic into separate, well-documented helper functions. This would improve readability and future maintenance.
- **Code Readability:**  
  - Use comments liberally to explain why specific regular expressions or conditions are used, especially in the webview detection sections.
- **Configuration Options:**  
  - Externalise parameters such as cookie expiry days, domain settings, and key URL parameters to a configuration object. This enables easier adjustments without modifying the core logic.
- **Maintain ES5 Compliance:**  
  - Ensure that all refactoring continues to use ES5 syntax (using functions, var keyword, etc.) and avoids ES6 features like arrow functions, let/const declarations, or template literals.
- **Testing Boundaries:**  
  - Consider adding conditional logging during development to capture and verify behaviour, but remove or disable this logging in production.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  - Establish a clear owner or team responsible for the LBGAnalytics integration to keep track of any changes in the global objects or data layer methods.
  - Regularly review browser console logs during development and production releases to ensure that no unexpected errors in the try-catch blocks are silently failing.
- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Create unit tests covering various scenarios:
    - Presence and absence of `utag_data`.
    - Webview detection under different URL and cookie scenarios.
    - Verification of correct cookie values when `nga_constants` is provided.
  - Use debug environments to simulate webview conditions and observe the execution flow.
- **Documentation Updates:**  
  - Keep documentation in sync with any modifications in URLs, DOM selectors, or analytic methods.
  - Incorporate change logs for any updates to the extension to facilitate rollback or future enhancements.

This documentation should serve as a comprehensive guide for developers and stakeholders involved with the Tealium iQ extension. Any updates to business logic or the underlying analytics libraries should be reflected promptly in this documentation to ensure continued alignment with system behaviour.
