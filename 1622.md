# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation

## Extension Overview
- **Name**: Temporary Cookie Stitch Rollout
- **ID**: 1622
- **Type**: Javascript Code
- **Scope**: Pre Loader
- **Execution Frequency**: Run Once

### Summary
The Temporary Cookie Stitch Rollout extension enhances the tracking functionalities by managing cookies across user sessions. It stitches cookie information together and decorates URLs with a specific parameter (`LBGAc`). The extension helps maintain user state and supports cookie opt-out management, ensuring compliance with user privacy preferences.

## Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- **target**: The main object that serves as a namespace for the cookie functions.
- **cookiehash**: A string that retrieves and processes cookies from the current URL.
- **cookieobj**: An object representing decoded cookie values.
- **hash**: Represents the URL hash value to ensure the original links are preserved while being decorated.

### Logic Flow
1. **Setting Cookie Functions**:
   - Cookies are filtered through `target.stitchCookies`, enabling the extension to manage specific cookies that require tracking.
   
2. **Hash Generation (getCookieHash)**:
   - Constructs a hash string from the list of cookies returned by `target.listCookies()`, encoding cookie values and adding a timestamp with an expiration period.

3. **Hash Decoding (decodeCookieHash)**:
   - Accepts a hash, splits it, decodes its components, and populates `cookieobj` with validated cookies while checking timestamps.

4. **Cookie Management**:
   - On page load, it attempts to retrieve a cookie hash from the URL or from `window.name`, ensuring that any valid cookies are set for a duration of 90 days.

5. **URL Decoration**:
   - Links are modified to include decorator parameters, enriching them with tracking information before user interaction.

### Dependencies
- **LBGAnalytics**: The extension relies on the `LBGAnalytics` library object, particularly its `$` function for DOM manipulation and `cookies` methods.

## Usage Examples

### Normal Conditions
1. A user visits a page with specific cookies. The extension retrieves these cookies and encodes them, allowing them to be passed along with URL links that users may click on.

### Edge Conditions
1. If no valid cookies are retrieved, the extension will not set any cookies, and the user may not maintain their session state.
2. Errors during cookie processing will silently fail due to the catch blocks, which may lead to obscure issues if not logged.

## Known Limitations & Gotchas
- Missing or malformed cookie hashes could lead to `undefined` returns from `decodeCookieHash`, resulting in potential loss of user tracking information.
- If other scripts manipulate `window.name`, it could inadvertently overwrite the expected values, causing discrepancies in user data retention.
- Events that occur during quick navigation may lead to race conditions, in which a cookie value isn't set before a new page load happens.

## Recommendations for Refactoring
1. **Defensive Checks**: Include validations for cookies retrieved, especially to handle cases where cookies could be improperly structured.
  
2. **Code Style Enhancements**:
   - Modularise functionality by encapsulating related actions within self-contained functions.
   - Consider replacing `for(var k in cookieobj)` with `Object.keys(cookieobj).forEach` to improve clarity, though in ES5, you’ll need to handle it appropriately.

3. **Improved Logging**: Utilize a more structured logging system rather than `console.log` for maintaining traceability of cookies being processed or potential errors encountered.

## Maintenance & Further Notes
- **Ownership**: Assign a dedicated team member to oversee the extension’s functionality and ensure its alignment with business goals as cookie regulations evolve.
- **Testing Guidelines**: Regularly test the extension in various browser environments to account for differences in cookie management. Automated tests should be considered to cover both standard and edge cases.
- **Ongoing Improvements**: Monitoring user feedback and analytics can provide insights into required enhancements or modifications to the extension’s logic.
