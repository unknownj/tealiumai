# Temporary Cookie Stitch Rollout Extension

This document details the "Temporary Cookie Stitch Rollout" extension for Tealium iQ, including an overview of the extension, a detailed explanation of its code and logic, usage examples, known limitations, recommendations for refactoring, and maintenance guidelines.

---

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Temporary Cookie Stitch Rollout  
- **Extension ID:** 100036  
- **Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** Pre Loader  
- **Occurrence (Execution Frequency):** Run Once  

### Summary

This extension is designed to enable cookie stitching between different pages or sites by encoding selected cookie names and their values into a hash. It decodes incoming cookie hash values from URL query parameters or the window.name property, and then re-establishes these cookies with defined expiry times. The extension also decorates anchor URLs with the cookie hash when navigating to specific pages. Its primary purpose is to enable a temporary session handover between different parts of a site (or across sites) so that user state can be maintained.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables and Functions

- **Global Objects and Dependencies:**  
  - `window`: The browser’s global object.  
  - `LBGAnalytics`: A presumed global namespace for analytics and cookie handling. It must exist with properties such as `$.fn.extend`, `cookies`, and `cookies.getItem`.  
  - `btoa/atob`: Browser functions used for Base64 encoding and decoding.

- **Core Functions in the Extension:**

  - **enhanceCookieLogic(target):**  
    Enhances the provided target object (expected to be `LBGAnalytics.cookies`) with additional cookie-related methods.
    
    - **target.stitchCookies(a):**  
      Returns `true` for cookies matching specific patterns or names. It checks if:
      - The cookie string starts with "OPTOUTMULTI"
      - Contains the substring "230D643E5A2550980A495DB6"
      - Is exactly "LBGc3"  
      This function is used as a filter to identify which cookies are eligible for stitching.
    
    - **target.getCookieHash(seconds):**  
      Constructs a cookie hash string.  
      Steps:
      1. Retrieves a list of cookies via `target.listCookies()`.
      2. Filters the list using `target.stitchCookies` to select only specific cookies.
      3. Maps each cookie to a value where both the cookie name and its value (retrieved using `LBGAnalytics.cookies.getItem`) are Base64 encoded.
      4. Joins these encoded pairs using a period (`.`) delimiter.
      5. Appends a timestamp indicator ("ts") along with the current time (plus an offset defined by the `seconds` parameter) encoded in a URL-safe manner (using a base-36 conversion).
      6. Returns the concatenated string.
    
    - **target.decodeCookieHash(hash):**  
      Decodes the cookie hash string into a cookie object using the following process:
      1. Splits the hash string into parts by the period (`.`) delimiter.
      2. Pairs each even-index Base64 string with the following odd-index string (decoded using `atob`) to form cookie name/value pairs.
      3. Filters the results to only include pairs where the cookie name is "ts" (timestamp marker) or if it passes the `target.stitchCookies` check.
      4. Reduces the filtered list into a single object:
         - For the "ts" marker, it converts the timestamp value back from base-36 to an integer and checks if that timestamp is valid (i.e. falls within a window of up to 10 minutes into the future).
         - Adds all valid cookies to an object keyed by the cookie name.
      5. Returns the resultant object (or `undefined` if any error arises).

- **Cookie Hash Transport Logic:**

  - Attempts to capture a cookie hash passed in the query parameter `LBGAc` from the URL.
  - If unable to decode from the URL, optionally attempts to use `window.name` as a fallback.
  - If a valid cookie hash is found, iterates through the cookie object and re-sets each cookie (except for "valid") using `target.setItem` with a 90-day expiry period.
  - This mechanism supports transferring cookie values when redirecting between pages.

- **Anchor Decoration & Event Binding:**

  - The extension extends the jQuery-like object (`LBGAnalytics.$.fn`) with a `decorate` method that appends key/value pairs to an anchor tag’s `href` as query parameters.
  - It selects all `<a>` elements with an `href` attribute and maps over them to change specific links (e.g., a particular Halifax share dealing link) by updating their URL and setting an attribute `fudgeref`.
  - An event handler for `mousedown` is attached to anchor tags. When clicked, if the `href` does not represent a same-domain link, it:
    - Sets `window.name` to a temporary cookie hash (valid for 30 seconds).
    - For specific URL patterns (e.g. logon pages or form login pages), it decorates the link with an additional query parameter (`LBGAc`) set to a freshly generated cookie hash that is valid for 60 seconds.

- **Duplicate Logic Note:**
  
  At the end of the code, there is an additional definition of `LBGAnalytics.cookies.stitchCookies` which is similar to the previous implementation but adds an extra check for cookie names starting with "AMCV". This redundancy could be a result of evolving requirements and might need cleaning up.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Scenario

1. **Initial Page Load:**
   - The extension runs during the Pre Loader stage.
   - It checks the URL for a query parameter `LBGAc`. If found, it decodes the cookie hash to retrieve cookies (and a timestamp).
   - Valid cookies are re-set with a 90-day expiry, making them available to the rest of the site.

2. **User Clicks an External Link:**
   - When the user clicks on an anchor tag not belonging to the current domain:
     - The event handler on `mousedown` triggers.
     - The extension immediately sets `window.name` with a temporary cookie hash (for 30 seconds).
     - If the link’s `href` matches certain patterns (e.g. logon pages), the link is modified ("decorated") to append a fresh `LBGAc` value, ensuring that the session cookies are stitched across transitions.

### Edge Case Scenario

- **Invalid or Tampered Cookie Hash:**
  - If the cookie hash in the URL or `window.name` is incorrectly formatted or fails decoding, `target.decodeCookieHash` returns `undefined`.
  - Consequently, no cookies will be set, and the site might fall back on other session-handling methods.
  
- **Same-Domain Link Navigation:**
  - If an anchor’s `href` contains the default domain (as determined by `LBGAnalytics.cookies.defaultDomain`), the decoration logic is bypassed, assuming no need for cookie stitching because the session is maintained internally.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Dependence on Global Objects:**  
  The extension relies heavily on objects like `window`, `LBGAnalytics`, and `$`. If any of these are not defined or get overridden, the extension will likely fail.
  
- **Error Swallowing:**  
  The try/catch blocks silently process errors (e.g. in `getCookieHash`, `decodeCookieHash`, and in the event binding). This means debugging failures may be challenging since errors are not surfaced.

- **Duplicate Logic:**  
  There are two different implementations of `stitchCookies` in the code. These slight differences (e.g. one version checks for "AMCV") can lead to inconsistencies in how cookies are filtered across the extension.

- **Browser Support:**  
  The extension is written in ES5; while this ensures wide compatibility, some modern browsers may provide improved APIs that are not leveraged here.

- **URL String Manipulation Complexity:**  
  Manual parsing and reassembly of URLs (for query string handling and fragment preservation) can produce edge cases if the URL format deviates slightly.

- **Timing & Expiry:**  
  The logic that validates the timestamp uses the current time with a 10-minute window and an additional 600,000 milliseconds offset. This mechanism may not hold up in slow or delayed network conditions.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Consolidate Duplicate Functionality:**  
  Merge the two versions of `stitchCookies` so that there is a single source of truth regarding which cookies should be stitched. Consider storing the list of cookie prefixes or conditions in a single configuration object.

- **Improve Error Handling:**  
  Rather than swallowing errors silently, log sufficient details or provide feedback via a debugging console. This would help during troubleshooting without compromising production flow.

- **Modularise URL Handling Logic:**  
  Encapsulate URL parsing, decoration, and reconstruction into separate helper methods. This improves readability and makes it easier to test each aspect independently.

- **Commenting and Documentation Inline:**  
  More inline comments summarising each step of the complex logic (e.g. base64-encoding, timestamp handling) will improve code readability for future maintainers.

- **Testing of Time-sensitive Logic:**  
  Extract the time adjustment code into a dedicated function that can be unit-tested in isolation, ensuring that changes in system clock or delays do not unexpectedly break the session stitching.

- **Retain ES5 Standards:**  
  Ensure that any refactoring maintains ES5 compatibility. Avoid introducing ES6 features such as arrow functions, template literals, or block scoped variables.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ownership:**  
  The extension appears to be a part of the ongoing analytics and session management infrastructure at LBG. Establish clear ownership with relevant stakeholders to monitor dependency changes (e.g. changes in `LBGAnalytics` library).

- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Unit test each function (especially decoding and encoding of cookie hashes).
  - Simulate navigation events to ensure that the cookie stitching logic behaves as expected.
  - Validate that edge conditions (e.g. invalid or expired cookie hashes) are handled gracefully.
  - Monitor browser console logs for any suppressed errors and understand the contexts in which they occur.

- **Ongoing Enhancements:**  
  Regularly review the underlying assumptions (e.g., URL structure, presence of `window.name`, and global variables) as the site evolves. A regression test suite should be maintained as part of the deployment pipeline.

- **Documentation Updates:**  
  Keep this documentation updated as changes are made to the extension. This is crucial for current and future developers who may work with the code.
