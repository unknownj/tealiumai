# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation

## 1. Extension Overview
- **Name**: Timings Capture
- **ID**: 100036
- **Type**: Javascript Code
- **Scope**: 928
- **Execution Frequency**: On each event trigger

### Summary
The "Timings Capture" extension is designed to track and log various timing metrics related to page events. This extension captures timing information for key lifecycle events (such as loading and running main scripts) and sends this data to the LBGAnalytics service. By doing this, it offers insights into the performance of web applications and helps identify any potential bottlenecks or issues affecting user experience.

## 2. Code Explanation
### Key Variables
- `t`: A reference to the `utag_timing` object, which contains timing metrics for various parts of the Tealium implementation.
- `eventType`: Represents the type of event being processed.
- `eventPayload`: Provides additional context or data for the event.

### Logic Flow
1. The extension checks if the `utag_timing` object exists. If it does not, the function returns early.
2. The current timestamp (in milliseconds) is appended to the `event` property of `utag_timing`.
3. An initial generic event (ID 314) is dispatched to the LBGAnalytics service.
4. A loop iterates over the keys in `utag_timing`.
   - For each key, it verifies if the value is a positive number and less than one hour (in milliseconds).
   - Depending on the key name (`sync`, `loadmain`, `runmain`, `event`), corresponding generic events (IDs 315, 316, 317, and 318) are dispatched with the associated timing value.

### Dependencies
- The code relies on the global `window.utag_timing` object for timing values.
- It calls `LBGAnalytics.events.genericEvent` to send data. This function is assumed to be part of an external analytics library that has been properly integrated.

## 3. Usage Examples
### Normal Scenario
When a user navigates to a webpage:
- The `timing` metrics are populated within the `utag_timing` object.
- The `Timings Capture` extension triggers, appending the current timestamp to the timing data.
- Timing values for events such as `loadmain` and `runmain` are sent to `LBGAnalytics`, providing insight into page performance.

### Edge Conditions
- If no timing values exist in `utag_timing`, no events are dispatched to `LBGAnalytics`.
- If a timing value exceeds one hour, it will be ignored, preventing the capturing of outlier data points.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas
- The extension will not function if the `utag_timing` object is absent due to improper configuration.
- Events outside the specified thresholds (0ms to 3600000ms) are ignored, potentially omitting relevant data.
- It may conflict with other extensions that also manipulate `utag_timing`, leading to unexpected results if they are not well-coordinated.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring
- **Defensive Checks**: While we are not focused on defensive coding here, consider adding checks to ensure that `LBGAnalytics` and its methods are defined before invoking them. This can guard against runtime errors.
- **Code Style**: Adhere to consistent naming conventions and code formatting to enhance readability.
- **Modularisation**: For future scalability, consider refactoring the event dispatching logic into a separate function, simplifying the main execution flow.
- **Use of Comments**: Adding comments to explain the purpose of each key section can benefit developers unfamiliar with the codebase.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes
- **Ongoing Maintenance**: Regularly review and update the extension in line with the latest Tealium iQ upgrades and changes.
- **Ownership**: Designate a team or individual responsible for monitoring the extension's performance and making necessary adjustments.
- **Testing Guidelines**: Ensure thorough testing on staging environments before deployment to production, especially when other extensions or external code are altered.

By maintaining clear documentation and following the above recommendations, the "Timings Capture" extension can continue to provide valuable insights into web performance while remaining compatible with the broader Tealium ecosystem.
