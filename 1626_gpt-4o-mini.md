# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: Timings Capture

## Extension Overview

- **Name**: Timings Capture
- **ID**: 1626
- **Type**: Javascript Code
- **Scope**: 928
- **Execution Frequency**: Active

### Summary
The Timings Capture extension is designed to track the timing of various events within a web application. It captures the timing data from the `utag_timing` object and sends it to LBG Analytics as generic events. This allows for enhanced performance monitoring and diagnostics. By tracking specific timing events such as `sync`, `loadmain`, `runmain`, and `event`, this extension provides valuable insights into load performance and user experience.

## Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- `t`: A reference to the `utag_timing` object which contains measurement data for various events.
  
### Logic Flow
1. **Null Check**: The extension first checks if `utag_timing` exists. If not, the function returns early without executing further.
2. **Event Timestamp**: It appends the current timestamp (in milliseconds) to the existing event property `event` within the `utag_timing` object.
3. **Event Logging**: The code iterates over the properties of the `utag_timing` object.
   - If a property's value is greater than 0 and less than one hour (in milliseconds), it checks for specific keys and sends the corresponding timing value to LBG Analytics using `genericEvent`.
     - `sync` → Event ID 315
     - `loadmain` → Event ID 316
     - `runmain` → Event ID 317
     - `event` → Event ID 318

### Dependencies
The extension relies on:
- The global `window.utag_timing` object for tracking timing events.
- The `LBGAnalytics` object which is assumed to have a method `events.genericEvent()` for logging events.

## Usage Examples

### Normal Conditions
When the timings for events are being recorded properly:

1. **Scenario**: A user accesses a web page.
   - **Input**: `utag_timing` contains timing values for `sync`, `loadmain`, and `runmain`.
   - **Output**: The extension will send timed events to LBG Analytics for events corresponding to the timing captured.

### Edge Conditions
1. **Scenario**: If `utag_timing` is not defined.
   - **Input**: The page attempts to run the Timings Capture extension.
   - **Output**: The extension safely exits without producing error logs or triggering any event sends, maintaining stability.

2. **Scenario**: Timing values exceeding one hour.
   - **Input**: A timing value is greater than `1000 * 60 * 60`.
   - **Output**: Those values will not be processed, ensuring only relevant timing data is sent.

## Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Timing Data**: Only timing values between 0 and 3600000 milliseconds (1 hour) are captured. Values beyond this range are ignored, which may lead to loss of potentially useful data.
- **Global Object Dependency**: The extension will fail silently if `window.utag_timing` is not present, and this behaviour can be problematic if expected data is not being logged.
- **Event Execution**: The extension may conflict with other scripts that also try to manipulate the `utag_timing` object, leading to unpredictable behaviour if timings are modified concurrently.

---

## Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Error Handling**: Consider adding logging or notifications if there is a notable absence of `utag_timing`, rather than failing silently.
- **Modular Approach**: Encapsulate sending events into a separate function for clarity and easier unit testing in the future. This will improve readability and maintainability.
- **Code Styling**: Consistency in variable naming and adherence to a uniform coding style would enhance code quality. For example, using `for...in` is appropriate here, but caution should be taken to check for inherited properties.

## Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ownership**: Designate a responsible team member for ongoing maintenance, ensuring they are familiar with the extension's dependencies and integrations.
- **Testing Guidelines**: Create unit tests for the extension to ensure that timing events are being captured and reported as expected. Test under different scenarios, including missing `utag_timing` and high timing values.
- **Documentation Updates**: Ensure that this documentation is updated whenever the extension is modified or new features are added. Encourage feedback from users to improve clarity and usefulness.
