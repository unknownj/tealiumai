# Travel Money Pref Rates Extension Documentation

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Travel money pref rates  
- **ID:** 1648  
- **Extension ID (Reference):** 100036  
- **Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** After Load Rules  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Always  

**Summary:**  
This extension is designed to detect specific conditions in the travel money journey. It monitors the journey for a preferential rate scenario. If the journey is a "BuyTravelMoney" journey at step 2, then, depending on whether a preferential rate icon exists on the page, it categorises the rate as either "Preferential rate" or "Standard rate" using the LBGAnalytics API. This segregation assists in defining customer attributes based on the user's interaction with the page, thereby allowing for better-targeted analytics and reporting.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- **a (eventType):** The event type that triggers the script. It is expected to hold a string value, e.g. "view".
- **b (eventPayload):** The event payload object containing relevant data such as "JourneyName" and "JourneyStep".

### Logic Flow
1. **Timeout Invocation:**  
   The code is wrapped in a `setTimeout` with a delay of 3000 milliseconds (3 seconds) before executing the conditional logic. This ensures that the DOM and any dynamic journey data are likely to be fully loaded.

2. **Journey Detection:**  
   - The script checks if the `JourneyName` property exists in the payload `b` and confirms it equals "BuyTravelMoney".
   - Next, it validates that `JourneyStep` equals "2" (either as a string or number).

3. **Event Type Check:**  
   - The extension only performs further actions if the event type `a` is equal to "view". This is a basic safeguard to ensure that the tracking only occurs on view events.

4. **DOM Element Check:**  
   - It searches for elements with the CSS class name `get-a-quote-page__pref-rate-icon`.
   - If one or more such elements are found, it logs a customer attribute of "segment" with the value "Preferential rate".
   - If no elements are found, it logs the attribute with the value "Standard rate".

5. **Usage of LBGAnalytics:**  
   - The code utilises the global object `LBGAnalytics` to:
     - Set a customer attribute.
     - Chain the promise methods `.done()`, `.events.apiResponse()`, and `.send()` to process and send the analytics data.

### Dependencies on Global Objects or Libraries
- **LBGAnalytics:**  
  The code makes use of a global LBGAnalytics object that must be available in the environment. This object is responsible for tracking and sending customer attribute data.
  
- **eventType and eventPayload:**  
  Both these variables are assumed to be injected by the Tealium environment and are guaranteed to be present (no defensive coding needed for their availability).

- **DOM API:**  
  The script uses the `document.getElementsByClassName` method, a standard DOM API, to find elements matching the specified CSS class.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Preferential Rate Detected
- **Input Conditions:**
  - `eventPayload.JourneyName` is "BuyTravelMoney"
  - `eventPayload.JourneyStep` is 2 (or "2")
  - `eventType` equals "view"
  - The DOM contains at least one element with the class `get-a-quote-page__pref-rate-icon`
- **Flow:**
  1. The script delays for 3 seconds.
  2. It confirms that the journey is "BuyTravelMoney" at step 2.
  3. Since the event is a "view" event and the preferential rate icon is found, it sends through LBGAnalytics:
     - Customer attribute "segment" set to "Preferential rate".
- **Outcome:**  
  The analytics system is updated with a preferential rate segment for the customer.

### Scenario 2: Standard Rate (No Preferential Rate Icon)
- **Input Conditions:**
  - `eventPayload.JourneyName` is "BuyTravelMoney"
  - `eventPayload.JourneyStep` is 2 (or "2")
  - `eventType` equals "view"
  - The DOM does not contain any element with the class `get-a-quote-page__pref-rate-icon`
- **Flow:**
  1. The script delays for 3 seconds.
  2. It validates the journey conditions.
  3. Since the event is "view" but no preferential rate icon is found, it sends through LBGAnalytics:
     - Customer attribute "segment" set to "Standard rate".
- **Outcome:**  
  The analytics system is updated indicating that the customer does not receive a preferential rate.

### Scenario 3: Irrelevant Journey or Step
- **Input Conditions:**
  - `eventPayload.JourneyName` is not "BuyTravelMoney" (or `JourneyStep` is not equal to 2).
- **Flow:**
  1. After the timeout, the script checks the journey name and step.
  2. If conditions are not met, no further action or analytics tracking is performed.
- **Outcome:**  
  The extension exits without sending any customer attributes.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Delayed Execution:**  
  Due to the 3-second delay, rapid changes in the DOM or user interactions might not be captured if they occur outside of this timeframe.

- **DOM Dependency:**  
  The tracking is based on the existence of DOM elements with a specific class name. If the page structure or class names change, the logic may fail to detect preferential rates.

- **Global Object Reliance:**  
  The extension depends on the global `LBGAnalytics` object. In cases where this object is not loaded or its API changes, the extensionâ€™s functionality will be impaired.

- **Single Condition Path:**  
  The code only examines the journey conditions and the event type "view". Any events or conditions beyond these will not trigger any analytics, which may not cover all use cases.

- **No Error Handling:**  
  If any of the conditions fail (e.g. undefined properties beyond those checked), the extension simply returns without logging errors. This may complicate debugging if issues arise.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Improve Code Modularity:**  
  Consider encapsulating the conditional logic into smaller functions. This makes it easier to unit test each module separately, while still keeping within ES5 constraints.

- **Enhanced Defensive Checks (Where Appropriate):**  
  While the extension assumes the presence of `eventType` and `eventPayload`, additional checks could be implemented on the properties of `eventPayload` to catch unexpected values.

- **Timeout Handling:**  
  If the delay is critical, document why the 3-second delay is necessary for clarity. Alternatively, consider implementing event-based triggers if available.

- **DOM Element Caching:**  
  If the preferential rate icons do not change during the lifecycle of the page, consider caching the result of `document.getElementsByClassName` in a variable to avoid multiple redundant lookups should the logic expand in the future.

- **Comment Clarity:**  
  Adding more inline comments describing complex logic paths (especially within nested conditionals) could aid future developers in understanding and maintaining the code.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ownership & Versioning:**  
  Maintain version control for this extension along with detailed commit messages on any changes to the logic. Periodically review the integration with the LBGAnalytics API to ensure compatibility.

- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Develop automated tests covering scenarios where the preferential rate icon is present and absent.
  - Validate the timing delay behaviour and ensure that dynamic DOM changes are captured correctly.
  - Test across various browsers supported by ES5 to ensure uniform behaviour.

- **Documentation Updates:**  
  Keep the documentation in sync with code changes. Any change to journey conditions, event types, or the DOM structure should be reflected in the documentation.

- **Further Integration:**  
  If additional data points are required by LBGAnalytics or if there are changes in the journey structure, consider extending the logic cautiously, ensuring backward compatibility with ES5.
