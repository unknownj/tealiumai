# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation

This document provides a detailed explanation of the "PageViewID and SendDepth" extension used within Tealium iQ. It covers an overview, code explanation, usage examples, known limitations, refactoring suggestions, and maintenance guidelines.

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** PageViewID and SendDepth
- **ID:** 1651  
- **Extension Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** 928  
- **Execution Frequency:** This extension is executed every time the tag (or event) is processed, as it increments a counter for each invocation.

**Summary:**  
The extension is designed to create and manage unique identifiers and counters on a per-page view basis. It does the following:
- Generates a unique PageViewID if one does not already exist in the event payload.
- Preserves an existing PageViewID from the `eventPayload` (referred to as `b.PageViewID` in the code) when available.
- Generates or increments a SendDepth counter which tracks the number of times the tag (or event) has been processed during the page view.
- The unique identifier and counter are injected into the event payload, making them available for further use in analytics or subsequent tag processing.

## 2. Code Explanation

**Key Variables and Parameters:**

- `a`: Represents the `eventType` parameter. Although not explicitly used in this code snippet, it is available if needed.
- `b`: Represents the `eventPayload`, an object where attributes like `PageViewID` and `SendDepth` are stored.
- `u`: Represents `tagObject`, a shared object that persists across extensions and invocations within the same page view session.

**Logic Flow:**
1. **Existing PageViewID Check:**  
   - The code first checks if `b.PageViewID` exists and if `u.lbgPageViewID` is not already set.  
   - If the condition is met, it assigns the value of `b.PageViewID` to `u.lbgPageViewID`, ensuring that the identifier is preserved.

2. **Generate Unique Identifier:**  
   - If no PageViewID is present in the shared object (`u.lbgPageViewID`), the extension creates one.  
   - This is done by concatenating:
     - The current timestamp converted to base-36.
     - A random number (generated via `Math.random()`), also converted to base-36 (after processing to remove the decimal separator).
   - The resulting string is stored as `u.lbgPageViewID`.

3. **SendDepth Handling:**  
   - The extension initialises `u.lbgSendDepth` if not already set, defaulting to 0.
   - Then it increments `u.lbgSendDepth` by 1 with each execution.

4. **Update the Payload:**  
   - Finally, the extension writes back the values into the event payload:
     - `b.PageViewID` is updated with `u.lbgPageViewID`.
     - `b.SendDepth` is updated with the new value of `u.lbgSendDepth`.

**Dependencies:**
- The extension relies on global objects provided by the Tealium iQ environment: `eventType`, `eventPayload`, and `tagObject`.
- It assumes access to the built-in JavaScript `Date` object and `Math` library, available in ES5 environments.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Normal Invocation on a New Page View
- **Incoming Payload:**  
  - `eventPayload` (`b`) does not have an existing `PageViewID`.
- **Processing:**  
  - The extension will generate a new unique `PageViewID` using the current timestamp and a random number.
  - `u.lbgSendDepth` is initialised to 0 and then incremented to 1.
- **Outgoing Payload:**  
  - `b.PageViewID` is set to the newly generated identifier.
  - `b.SendDepth` is set to 1.

### Scenario 2: Subsequent Invocation During the Same Page View
- **Incoming Payload:**  
  - `eventPayload` (`b`) may not have a `PageViewID`, but `tagObject` (`u`) already holds `lbgPageViewID` from a previous execution.
- **Processing:**  
  - The extension uses the stored `u.lbgPageViewID` rather than generating a new one.
  - `u.lbgSendDepth` is incremented from its previous value (e.g. from 1 to 2).
- **Outgoing Payload:**  
  - `b.PageViewID` remains the same.
  - `b.SendDepth` reflects the incremented count.

### Scenario 3: Edge Case with Predefined PageViewID in the Payload
- **Incoming Payload:**  
  - `eventPayload` (`b`) has a pre-existing `PageViewID`.
- **Processing:**  
  - If `u.lbgPageViewID` is not set yet, it will synchronise with `b.PageViewID`.
  - `u.lbgSendDepth` is initialised (or incremented) accordingly.
- **Outgoing Payload:**  
  - The pre-existing `PageViewID` is retained.
  - `b.SendDepth` is updated to track the send depth counter.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Single Page View Assumption:**  
  - The script is designed to work within a single page view. If multiple page views share the same tag execution context without proper refresh, the PageViewID might not reflect a true new session.

- **No Collision Protection:**  
  - The unique identifier is generated with a combination of timestamp and random number, which is generally sufficient, but it does not guarantee absolute collision avoidance.

- **Global Dependencies:**  
  - The extension depends on `eventType`, `eventPayload`, and `tagObject` being available in the execution context. Any changes to these might affect functionality.

- **Inter-extension Conflicts:**  
  - If another extension also manipulates `u.lbgPageViewID` or `u.lbgSendDepth`, unexpected behaviours might occur.
  - Conflicts may arise if there are other extensions that modify the same keys on `eventPayload` without coordinating life cycles.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks:**  
  - Currently, there is an implicit assumption that `eventType`, `eventPayload`, and `tagObject` are available. Although guaranteed per project requirements, consider simple type checks in more complex environments.
  
- **Code Style & Readability:**  
  - Consider adding comments within the code to describe each logical step for easier future maintenance.
  - Modularise sections of the code (for instance, create helper functions for generating the unique identifier) if the extension complexity increases.
  
- **ES5 Compatibility:**  
  - Maintain the ES5 syntax as required. Ensure that any future enhancements do not introduce ES2015+ features.
  
- **Avoid Global Namespace Pollution:**  
  - Keep using namespaced properties on `tagObject` (e.g. `u.lbgPageViewID`) to avoid collisions with other global variables.
  
- **Logging for Debugging:**  
  - Optionally integrate console logging (while ensuring not to pollute production logs) for debugging purposes, particularly to trace how IDs and send depths evolve. This should be used conditionally or removed in production environments.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  - Regularly review the extension for compatibility with any changes in the Tealium iQ environment.
  - Document any changes with in-code comments and update this documentation to reflect modifications.
  
- **Ownership:**  
  - Assign responsible individuals or teams for the maintenance of this extension. Ensure that any future changes are reviewed against the current documentation.
  
- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Develop unit tests that simulate multiple invocations per page view to verify that the `PageViewID` remains static while `SendDepth` increments correctly.
  - Validate the identifier generation to ensure its uniqueness and format meet the expectations.
  - Test for any interactions or conflicts with other extensions, particularly ones that may affect the same shared `tagObject` properties.
  
- **Integration Checks:**  
  - Periodically test the integration between the extension and downstream analytics systems that consume `PageViewID` and `SendDepth` to ensure data consistency.
  
- **Documentation Updates:**  
  - Keep this documentation up to date with any refactoring or enhancements. Consider publishing changelogs for transparency with stakeholders.
