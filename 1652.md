# Documentation for Tealium iQ Extension

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name**: CWR Hub Retail Customer ID to OCISID
- **ID**: 100036
- **Type**: Javascript Code
- **Scope**: Before Load Rules
- **Execution Frequency**: Run Always

### Summary
This extension is designed to capture and transform the `RetailCustomerID` from the event payload into the `OCISID` within the same payload if the current page URL contains the segment "cwr-hub". This is useful for ensuring that user identification aligns correctly with the context of a retail customer when interacting with the CWR Hub environment.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- **`a`**: Represents the `eventType` string that indicates the type of event being processed.
- **`b`**: Represents the `eventPayload` object that carries the data related to the event.

### Logic Flow
1. The function checks the current URL's pathname to see if it contains the substring "cwr-hub".
2. If the condition is true, it further checks whether `RetailCustomerID` exists in the `eventPayload`.
3. If `RetailCustomerID` is found and `OCISID` is not present, it assigns the value of `RetailCustomerID` to `OCISID`.

### Dependencies
- This code relies on the global `window` object to access the current URL's pathname.
- It assumes that `eventType` (a string) and `eventPayload` (an object) are provided and available in the scope when the extension runs.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Condition
- **Scenario**: A user accesses the CWR Hub page with a valid `RetailCustomerID`.
    - **Input**: 
      ```javascript
      {
          "RetailCustomerID": "12345",
          "OCISID": null
      }
      ```
    - **Output**: 
      ```javascript
      {
          "RetailCustomerID": "12345",
          "OCISID": "12345"
      }
      ```

### Edge Condition
- **Scenario**: A user accesses a non-CWR Hub page or already has an `OCISID`.
    - **Input**: 
      ```javascript
      {
          "RetailCustomerID": "12345",
          "OCISID": "54321"
      }
      ```
    - **Output**: 
      ```javascript
      {
          "RetailCustomerID": "12345",
          "OCISID": "54321"
      }
      ```

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- The extension will only run if the current URL has the "cwr-hub" substring, meaning it will not affect data when the user is on other pages.
- If `RetailCustomerID` is missing, the extension will do nothing and simply pass through the `eventPayload` without modification.
- There is a possible race condition if other scripts modify `eventPayload` concurrently, leading to unexpected results.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks**: While eventType and eventPayload are guaranteed, consider adding checks before accessing them for better error handling.
- **Code Style**: Consider consistent formatting with indentation and spacing for improved readability.
- **Modularisation**: It may be beneficial to break the logic into smaller functions for clarity, although modularisation should respect the ES5 requirement.
- **Comments**: Adding inline comments to describe the purpose of each step would aid in future maintenance.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance**: Regularly review the logic to ensure it aligns with any changes to the structure of the event payload or the business rules regarding `RetailCustomerID` and `OCISID`.
- **Ownership**: Assign a dedicated developer to oversee this extension's functionality and to handle any issues that arise.
- **Testing Guidelines**: Implement thorough tests covering various scenarios, particularly focusing on boundary conditions where the extension's logic is engaged or skipped.
