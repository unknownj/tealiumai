# CWR Hub Retail Customer ID to OCISID Extension Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive guide to the "CWR Hub Retail Customer ID to OCISID" Tealium iQ extension, detailing its purpose, implementation logic, usage examples, limitations, and recommendations for future enhancements. This extension is written in ES5-compatible JavaScript.

---

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** CWR Hub Retail Customer ID to OCISID  
- **ID:**  
  - Extension ID: 100036  
  - Instance ID: 1652  
- **Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** Before Load Rules  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Always  

**Summary:**  
This extension is designed to copy the value from the property `RetailCustomerID` to `OCISID` within the event payload when certain conditions are met. The main condition is that the current page’s URL path includes the substring "cwr-hub". This implementation is useful in scenarios where the OCISID is required for further processing but is not initially present in the event payload. By ensuring that OCISID mirrors RetailCustomerID when appropriate, the extension helps maintain data consistency across the Tealium event lifecycle.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables and Parameters

- **eventType (a):**  
  This parameter is used as the first argument in the Immediately-Invoked Function Expression (IIFE). Although its contents are not directly manipulated in the code, it may be used for further context or conditional processing elsewhere in the Tealium environment.

- **eventPayload (b):**  
  This is an object containing event data. The extension specifically looks for properties `RetailCustomerID` and `OCISID` within this object.

### Logic Flow

1. **Determine URL Context:**  
   - The extension checks if the current page’s URL path (accessible via `window.location.pathname`) contains the substring "cwr-hub".  
   - This ensures that the extension logic is only executed on pages relevant to the CWR Hub.

2. **Conditional Data Processing:**  
   - **Condition 1:** The event payload (`b`) must have the property `RetailCustomerID` defined (truthy).
   - **Condition 2:** The event payload should not have the property `OCISID` (i.e., it must be undefined or falsy).
   - **Action:** When both conditions are met, the code assigns the value of `RetailCustomerID` to `OCISID` within the event payload. This provides a fallback mechanism ensuring that OCISID is populated based on the available RetailCustomerID.

### Dependencies

- **Global Objects:**  
  - `window.location.pathname` is utilised to determine the current URL.  
- **Assumptions:**  
  It is assumed that the objects passed as `eventType` and `eventPayload` are correctly provided by the Tealium system. No external libraries or additional modules are referenced.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Normal Condition

- **Context:**  
  The user navigates to a page with a URL containing "cwr-hub".
  
- **Incoming Event Payload:**  
  ```
  {
      RetailCustomerID: "12345",
      OCISID: undefined
  }
  ```
- **Outcome:**  
  The extension checks the URL and conditions, and then assigns:
  ```
  OCISID = "12345"
  ```
  The modified event payload becomes:
  ```
  {
      RetailCustomerID: "12345",
      OCISID: "12345"
  }
  ```

### Scenario 2: Edge Condition - URL Does Not Contain "cwr-hub"

- **Context:**  
  The user is on a page where the pathname does not include "cwr-hub".
  
- **Incoming Event Payload:**  
  ```
  {
      RetailCustomerID: "67890",
      OCISID: undefined
  }
  ```
- **Outcome:**  
  Since the URL condition is not met, the extension does not process the payload. The event payload remains unchanged.

### Scenario 3: Edge Condition - OCISID Already Exists

- **Context:**  
  On a valid "cwr-hub" page, the payload already has an OCISID value.
  
- **Incoming Event Payload:**  
  ```
  {
      RetailCustomerID: "54321",
      OCISID: "existing_value"
  }
  ```
- **Outcome:**  
  The extension identifies that `OCISID` is already set and does not override it. The event payload remains unchanged.

### Scenario 4: Edge Condition - Missing RetailCustomerID

- **Context:**  
  On a valid "cwr-hub" page, the payload is missing RetailCustomerID.
  
- **Incoming Event Payload:**  
  ```
  {
      OCISID: undefined
  }
  ```
- **Outcome:**  
  The absence of `RetailCustomerID` prevents any assignment. The event payload remains unchanged.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **URL Condition Dependency:**  
  - The extension strictly applies its logic based on the presence of "cwr-hub" in the URL path. If your URL routing changes or the substring is altered, the extension will not fire as expected.

- **Assumption on Payload Structure:**  
  - The extension assumes that `RetailCustomerID` and `OCISID` are used as defined. If other extensions modify these properties before or after this code runs, it could lead to unintended behaviour or conflict.

- **Sequential Execution:**  
  - Since the extension runs in the "Before Load Rules" phase, any modifications to the payload by this extension could be overwritten by subsequent processes if not managed correctly.

- **No Deep Validation:**  
  - The code does not perform type checks or validate the content of `RetailCustomerID` before assigning it to `OCISID`.

- **Potential Conflicts:**  
  - If there are other JavaScript extensions operating on the same payload data, unexpected overwrites may occur, so it is vital to maintain a clear execution order across extensions.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Code Readability & Comments:**  
  - Increase inline comments to document the purpose of key checks and assignments.
  - Consider refactoring the IIFE to separate the URL check and payload processing into distinct functions to improve modularity and readability.

- **Error Logging (If Applicable):**  
  - Even though defensive coding for the availability of `eventType` and `eventPayload` is not required, it could be beneficial to add logging (if supported by the environment) to capture unexpected behaviours.

- **Consistent Naming Conventions:**  
  - Maintain consistent naming conventions and ensure that variables clearly indicate their purpose within the extension.

- **Enhanced Condition Checks:**  
  - Although not strictly necessary in this instance, additional validity checks on `RetailCustomerID` (e.g. checking for non-empty strings) might be useful in future iterations.

*Note:* These suggestions remain within the confines of ES5 compatibility requirements and avoid ES2015/ES6 syntax enhancements.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Testing:**  
  - Regularly test the extension when routing changes occur or when other extensions that modify payload data are introduced.
  - Verify the consistency of the data layer elements (`RetailCustomerID` and `OCISID`) during various event scenarios.

- **Ownership:**  
  - Ensure that there is clear documentation regarding who is responsible for this extension and maintain version control so that any changes can be traced and reviewed.

- **Change Management:**  
  - Record changes and update the documentation whenever new conditions or modifications are introduced. Linking to the version history in your repository can be useful.

- **Collaboration:**  
  - Engage with other developers to review potential conflicts with other Tealium extensions or external scripts. A periodic code review process will help in identifying any emerging issues.

- **Environment Monitoring:**  
  - Monitor the production environment for any irregularities or errors that might be linked to changes in the event payload or URL structure, ensuring timely interventions if required.
