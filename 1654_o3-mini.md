# Tealium Event Definitions Extension

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Tealium Event definitions  
- **ID:** 1654  
- **Extension Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** After Load Rules  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Always  

**Summary:**  
This extension processes events by evaluating various conditions based on event payload properties (such as ApplicationState, ProductGroup, JourneyName, and PageRole) and the current URL pathname. It assigns a custom event name to the payload property `tealium_event` to ensure that events are categorised correctly. Additionally, it utilises a caching mechanism (via `LBGAnalytics.tescache`) to avoid duplicate events. The primary purpose is to standardise event naming for analytics and ensure that unique user interactions are accurately recorded within a multi-journey context.

---

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables and Parameters
- **a (eventType):**  
  This parameter represents the original type of the event being processed. Typically, a value of `"view"` is expected and serves as the default or fallback event type.

- **b (eventPayload):**  
  This object contains various properties about the event (for example, ApplicationState, ProductGroup, JourneyName, PageRole) which are used to determine a more specific event name.

### Logic Flow
1. **Initial Reset of `tealium_event`:**  
   - If the property `tealium_event` on the event payload (b) is already equal to the incoming event type (a), it is deleted.  
   - This ensures that any previous assignment is cleared out before re-evaluation.

2. **Event Naming Based on Application State:**  
   - When the event type (`a`) equals `"view"`, the code checks combinations of `ApplicationState`, `ProductGroup`, and `JourneyName` to determine if the event should be reclassified as one of:
     - `"journey_completion"` if `ApplicationState` is `"Fulfilled"`
     - `"journey_summary"` if `ApplicationState` is `"Offered"`
     - `"journey_start"` if `ApplicationState` is `"Application"`
     - `"journey_decline"` if `ApplicationState` is `"Declined"`

3. **Duplicate Event Prevention (Caching):**  
   - The global object `LBGAnalytics` is used to store an array (`tescache`) of events that have already been processed.  
   - If `tealium_event` exists and is found in the cache, it is removed from the payload. Otherwise, it is added to the cache.  
   - This mechanism prevents the same event from being recorded more than once.

4. **Overriding via URL Pathname Checks:**  
   - Specific URL pathname checks override any previous event assignments:
     - If the pathname is `/personal/a/logon/entermemorableinformation.jsp` or `/personal/a/useradmin/mobile/logon/entermemorableinformation.jsp`, `tealium_event` is set to `"logon"`.
     - If the pathname is `/personal/a/registration/registrationcompleted.jsp` or `/personal/a/useradmin/mobile/registration/successregistration.jsp`, `tealium_event` is set to `"online_registration"`.

5. **Additional Event Assignment Based on Other Properties:**  
   - If no `tealium_event` has been assigned and both `ProductGroup` and `JourneyName` are present, the event defaults to `"journey_interaction"`.
   - If no `tealium_event` exists and the `PageRole` is `"Brochureware"` (along with the presence of `ProductGroup`), the event is named `"brochureware_view"`.
   - Finally, if none of the above conditions are met, the event defaults to the original event type (`a`).

### Dependencies on Global Objects or Libraries
- **Global Variable - LBGAnalytics:**  
  - The extension uses `LBGAnalytics.tescache` to track events that have already been processed. It assumes that `LBGAnalytics` is either already defined or will be defined elsewhere in the global scope.
- **Window and Document Properties:**  
  - The code relies on `window.location.pathname` to determine the current URL path for specific overrides.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Example 1: Journey Start
- **Input:**
  - `eventType` (a) is `"view"`.
  - `eventPayload` (b) includes:  
    - `ApplicationState`: `"Application"`
    - `ProductGroup`: [any truthy value]
    - `JourneyName`: [any truthy value]
- **Expected Behaviour:**
  - The extension assigns `b.tealium_event` the value `"journey_start"`.

### Example 2: Duplicate Event Prevention
- **Scenario:**
  - An event with a `tealium_event` of `"logon"` is processed and added to `LBGAnalytics.tescache`.
  - The same event is received again.
- **Expected Behaviour:**
  - The duplicate `"logon"` event is deleted from `b.tealium_event` to avoid reprocessing.

### Example 3: URL-Based Override for Logon
- **Input:**
  - `eventType` is `"view"`.
  - `window.location.pathname` equals `/personal/a/logon/entermemorableinformation.jsp`.
  - Other application properties might be set or not.
- **Expected Behaviour:**
  - Regardless of other conditions, `b.tealium_event` is set to `"logon"`.

### Example 4: Fallback to Default
- **Input:**
  - `eventType` is `"click"`.
  - `eventPayload` does not contain properties like `ProductGroup`, `JourneyName` or `PageRole` with relevant values.
- **Expected Behaviour:**
  - As no conditions match, `b.tealium_event` falls back to the original event type `"click"`.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Hardcoded URL Pathnames:**  
  The logic for determining `"logon"` and `"online_registration"` events is strictly tied to specific URL pathnames. Changes in the website URLs require corresponding updates in the extension code.

- **Conditional Overlap:**  
  In scenarios where multiple conditions might apply (for example, both a valid `ProductGroup`/`JourneyName` pair and a matching URL pathname), the order of conditions means URL checks may override earlier assignments. Ensure that this intended behaviour is well understood.

- **Global Dependency on LBGAnalytics:**  
  If the `LBGAnalytics` object is not defined, the caching mechanism (which prevents duplicate events) might fail. Coordination with other scripts that define or manipulate `LBGAnalytics` is necessary.

- **Event Property Assumptions:**  
  The code assumes that certain properties (`ApplicationState`, `ProductGroup`, `JourneyName`, `PageRole`) exist on the payload when applicable. If these are missing, the code will simply bypass the corresponding conditions without error, but may not record the desired event type.

- **Potential Conflicts with Other Extensions:**  
  Multiple extensions attempting to modify `tealium_event` might interfere with one another. A clearly defined order of execution is critical.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Modularisation:**  
  Consider breaking the code into smaller functions (while adhering to ES5 standards) for:
  - Evaluating event state conditions.
  - Handling URL pathname overrides.
  - Managing event caching.  
  This would improve readability and maintainability.

- **Consolidate URL Checks:**  
  Rather than having individual if-statements for each URL path, combine checks where appropriate (e.g., grouping logon URLs together) to reduce redundancy.

- **Enhance Commenting:**  
  Add inline comments for major decision points (e.g. cache update, fallback conditions) to aid future developers in understanding the logic quickly.

- **Defensive Checks for Global Dependencies:**  
  While it is assumed that `eventType` and `eventPayload` are always provided, you might want to document the dependency on `LBGAnalytics` more formally. Additionally, if possible within constraints, include a check for `LBGAnalytics` to ensure the cache mechanism does not throw errors in its absence.

- **Testing and Documentation:**  
  Ensure unit tests cover all condition branchesâ€”especially the edge cases where multiple conditions could conflict. This will help in refactoring and verifying that no regression is introduced.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Testing:**  
  Regularly test the extension in a staging environment, particularly after any backend or front-end changes that might affect URL pathnames or payload properties.

- **Ownership and Code Reviews:**  
  Assign a dedicated owner or team to maintain the extension. Include this extension in the regular code review process to capture any contextual changes that might impact its logic.

- **Version Control and Change Log:**  
  Keep the extension code in version control. Document any changes along with reasons for altering conditions or adding new ones. Include thorough comments both in the code and in commit messages.

- **Documentation Updates:**  
  Ensure that any refactoring, new conditions or removal of hardcoded values is documented immediately. Regularly update this documentation page to reflect changes to the logic or functionality.

- **Knowledge Transfer:**  
  Maintain a changelog and training documentation for any new team members who may need to understand or extend the functionality provided by this extension.
