# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name**: Adobe Track Callbacks
- **ID**: 1655
- **Type**: Javascript Code
- **Scope**: After Load Rules
- **Execution Frequency**: Run Always

### Summary
The Adobe Track Callbacks extension is designed to enhance the tracking capabilities for Adobe analytics within the Tealium iQ environment. It captures and logs analytics events, maintaining a record of callbacks involved in sending tracking requests. The extension also tracks values associated with a specific parameter (`c4`) from the tracking requests, allowing for better analysis and monitoring of analytics events.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- **LBGAnalytics.analyticsBeaconLog**: An array that stores URLs of analytics events sent.
- **LBGAnalytics.prop4log**: An object used to keep track of pre- and post-event statuses associated with a specific property (`c4`).

### Logic Flow
1. **Initial Setup**:
   - The extension begins by checking if `LBGAnalytics.analyticsBeaconLog` and `LBGAnalytics.prop4log` are defined. If not, it initialises them.
2. **Registering Callbacks**:
   - Two callbacks are registered using the `s.registerPostTrackCallback` and `s.registerPreTrackCallback` methods.
     - The **Pre-Track Callback** extracts the value of `c4` from the URL before sending the analytics request and sets a flag indicating that the pre-event has occurred.
     - The **Post-Track Callback** again extracts the same `c4` value after the analytics request and sets a flag indicating that the post-event has occurred. If the conditions are met, these values are logged into the `LBGAnalytics.prop4log` object.
3. **Failed Events**:
   - Finally, it constructs a string of `c4` values that did not have a post callback registered, providing insights into any unsuccessful tracking events.

### Dependencies
- This extension relies on the `s` object for registering callbacks. It assumes that this object is provided by the Adobe Analytics library. Additionally, it uses the global `LBGAnalytics` object to store event logs and parameters.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Operation
- When a tracking request is made, the URL is processed:
  - If the URL contains a `c4` parameter, it will be logged both pre- and post-event, indicating a successful tracking call.
  
### Edge Conditions
- If a tracking request does not include the `c4` parameter:
  - Neither the pre- nor post-event flags will be set, and the `prop4log` object will not be populated for that request.
- If multiple requests are made in rapid succession with the same `c4` value:
  - The extension ensures that it correctly logs the value without duplication in the internal structures.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Missing `c4` Parameter**: If the `c4` parameter is absent, tracking may result in unlogged events. This could affect analytics reporting and should be clearly communicated to users.
- **Concurrency Issues**: Multiple rapid track calls with the same `c4` value might lead to unexpected behaviour if not all URLs have a post callback registered, making it difficult to ascertain the state of tracking for those events.
- **Potential Conflicts**: If there are other extensions or scripts attempting to manipulate the same `LBGAnalytics` object or its properties, conflicts may arise, leading to unpredictable results.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks**: Though not required, consider adding checks to ensure that `requestUrl` is not null or undefined prior to processing.
- **Code Style**: Maintain consistency in coding style to improve readability. For instance, using meaningful variable names and properly formatting the code structure.
- **Modularization**: Consider encapsulating specific functionalities (e.g., tracking logic for pre- and post-callbacks) into separate functions to enhance maintainability and readability without introducing significant performance overhead.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance**: Assign an owner for this extension and establish a routine for reviewing and updating the code as necessary to adhere to evolving requirements or standards.
- **Testing Guidelines**: Develop unit tests or integration tests to validate the functionality of the extension, particularly after any changes to `LBGAnalytics` or the Adobe Analytics library.
- **Documentation Updates**: Ensure that this documentation remains current with any changes made to the extension, including updates to functionality or dependencies.

By following these guidelines and understanding the mechanics of the Adobe Track Callbacks extension, developers and stakeholders can effectively maintain and enhance the tracking capabilities within the Tealium iQ environment.
