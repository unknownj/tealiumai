# Adobe Track Callbacks Documentation

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Adobe Track Callbacks
- **ID:** 1655 (Extension ID: 100036)
- **Type:** Javascript Code
- **Scope:** After Load Rules
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Always

**Summary:**  
This extension is designed to intercept and process Adobe analytics tracking calls within Tealium iQ. It registers both pre-track and post-track callbacks to monitor and log critical analytics events. The extension captures URLs sent as part of tracking requests, extracts a specific query parameter (c4), and logs these events for further processing. By doing so, it ensures that unique analytics identifiers are tracked and any failed events (pre-call without a corresponding post-call) are highlighted.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables and Global Objects

- **LBGAnalytics.analyticsBeaconLog:**  
  - Initially declared as an array if it does not exist.  
  - Serves as the main log to store analytics beacon URLs.
  - Contains an additional property `subscribers` which is an array of functions to be notified after each beacon is logged.

- **LBGAnalytics.prop4log:**  
  - An object that stores the state of processing for a particular analytics parameter (c4 value) for both pre-track and post-track callbacks.
  - Each key is the value of the `c4` parameter and its value is an object indicating whether pre-tracking (`pre`) and/or post-tracking (`post`) callbacks have been executed.

### Logic Flow

1. **Initialisation of Analytics Beacon Log:**  
   - Checks whether `LBGAnalytics.analyticsBeaconLog` is undefined.  
   - If undefined, initialises it as an empty array and adds a `subscribers` array to notify any subscribed functions.

2. **Registration of Post-Track Callback for Analytics Beacon:**  
   - Registers a post-track callback through `s.registerPostTrackCallback`.  
   - On each call:
     - The full tracking URL is pushed into `LBGAnalytics.analyticsBeaconLog`.
     - Then, all subscriber functions (if any) are triggered, receiving a filtered unique list of URLs.
     - A console log, "Analytics event sent", is displayed.

3. **Initialisation of prop4log and Callback Registration:**  
   - Checks whether `LBGAnalytics.prop4log` is undefined.
   - If undefined, it is set to an empty object.
   - **Pre-Track Callback:**
     - Registered to capture the pre-track stage.
     - Extracts the value for parameter `c4` from the request URL.
     - Flags the corresponding `c4` entry as `pre: true`.
   - **Post-Track Callback:**
     - Registered similarly to capture the post-track stage.
     - Again extracts the `c4` value.
     - Flags the corresponding `c4` entry as `post: true`.

4. **Determining Failed Events:**
   - After the callbacks have been processed, a new property `FailedEvents` is added to the global `b` object.
   - This property is a string listing all `c4` values where the pre-track callback was executed without a corresponding post-track callback.
   - The filtering is done by iterating over the keys of `LBGAnalytics.prop4log`.

### Dependencies

- **Tealium Callback Registration (s.registerPreTrackCallback & s.registerPostTrackCallback):**  
  - The methods `registerPreTrackCallback` and `registerPostTrackCallback` are part of Tealium's API which allow developers to insert custom logic during the tracking lifecycle.
- **Global Object:**  
  - Relies on the global object `LBGAnalytics` to ensure the data is available across different tracking events.
- **Event Variables:**  
  - `eventType` and `eventPayload` (passed as `a` and `b` respectively) are assumed to be available and correctly typed as per the project scope.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Example Scenario 1: Standard Analytics Event Tracking

1. **A tracking event is triggered by Tealium:**
   - The URL containing various query parameters including `c4` is generated.
2. **Pre-Track Processing:**
   - The pre-track callback parses the URL.
   - If a parameter starting with `c4=` is found, it marks the corresponding `c4` value in `LBGAnalytics.prop4log` with `{ pre: true }`.
3. **Post-Track Processing:**
   - The post-track callback executes after tracking completes.
   - The same URL is processed; the callback marks the corresponding `c4` value with `post: true`.
   - The URL is then added to the `analyticsBeaconLog`, and any subscribers are notified.
4. **Outcome:**
   - The event appears as successful if both pre and post phases are correctly flagged.
   - Unique URLs are logged and console prints confirm the event transmission.

### Example Scenario 2: Edge Case – Missing Post-Track Callback

1. **A tracking event’s post-track callback does not execute (e.g. due to network issues or error in Tealium execution):**
   - The pre-track callback still marks `LBGAnalytics.prop4log` for the given `c4` value with `pre: true`.
   - Since the post-track callback does not run, `post` remains undefined for that key.
2. **Outcome:**
   - The `FailedEvents` property on the `b` (eventPayload) object will include the corresponding `c4` value indicating a failure in completing the full tracking lifecycle.
   - This helps in diagnosing events that did not fully process.

### Example Scenario 3: Multiple Subscribers

1. **Additional subscriber functions are added to `LBGAnalytics.analyticsBeaconLog.subscribers`:**
   - These functions are invoked on every post-track callback, and they receive a deduplicated list of the tracking URLs.
2. **Outcome:**
   - Subscribers can further process or alert based on the list of analytics events, enabling integration with additional monitoring or logging frameworks.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Global Object Conflicts:**
  - The extension directly augments a global object (`LBGAnalytics`). Ensure no other scripts interfere with this object to avoid unexpected behaviour.
- **Uniqueness Filtering:**
  - The built-in deduplication in the subscriber notification function assumes URLs are unique based on the entire URL string. Variations in order of query parameters could create false duplicates.
- **Dependency on Tealium Callback Methods:**
  - If Tealium’s methods (`registerPreTrackCallback` and `registerPostTrackCallback`) change or are not executed in the expected order, the extension’s logic might fail.
- **Edge Cases for Query Parameter Extraction:**
  - The extraction logic for the `c4` query parameter is simple and expects a strict key (`c4=`). If the URL contains multiple `c4` values or they are formatted differently, the data capture may not be reliable.
- **Error Logging:**
  - The code utilises a simple `console.log` for confirming event transmission. In production, relying solely on console output may not suffice for thorough error tracking.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Modular Code Organisation:**
  - Consider modularising the code into separate functions for clarity, such as dedicated functions for URL parsing and event state management.
- **Enhanced Defensive Checks:**
  - Although `eventType` and `eventPayload` are guaranteed, additional checks could be implemented for URL integrity to prevent malformed URL processing.
- **Improved Logging Mechanism:**
  - Replace or supplement `console.log` with a robust logging framework or Tealium’s internal logging, especially for production usage.
- **Documentation In-Code Comments:**
  - Increasing inline comments can help future maintainers understand the rationale behind each callback registration and processing step.
- **Separation of Concerns:**
  - Divide responsibilities clearly between handling pre-track logic and post-track logging to enhance readability and maintainability.
- **Testing Suite:**
  - Implement thorough unit tests to simulate both the standard and edge-case scenarios. Tests can help ensure the extension behaves as expected when future modifications are made.

*Note: Do not convert the code to use ES6 features like arrow functions, template literals, or let/const as ES5 support must be maintained.*

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**
  - Regularly review the integration with Tealium to ensure compatibility with any updates to the callback registration APIs.
  - Monitor the browser console and system logs for any unexpected errors or conflicts related to the usage of the `LBGAnalytics` object.
- **Ownership:**
  - Clearly define code ownership and establish a process for code review when changes are requested or during troubleshooting sessions.
- **Testing Guidelines:**
  - Develop comprehensive unit and integration tests covering both pre-track and post-track scenarios.
  - Simulate failure conditions (e.g. missing post-track callback) during testing to ensure the `FailedEvents` logic functions as intended.
  - Verify the extension in a staging environment before pushing updates to production.
- **Documentation Updates:**
  - Update this documentation as changes are made to the extension to ensure it remains an accurate and helpful resource for all stakeholders.
