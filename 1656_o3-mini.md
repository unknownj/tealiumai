# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive overview and explanation of the "Custom CCC QueryString Override" Tealium iQ extension. It covers the extension’s purpose, code breakdown, usage examples, known limitations, refactoring recommendations, and maintenance guidelines.

---

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Custom CCC QueryString Override  
- **ID:** 1656 (Extension ID within library: 100036)  
- **Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** After Load Rules  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Always

**Summary:**  
This extension is designed to inspect the current page URL when the pathname contains “/ccc/”. It extracts query string parameters and checks for specific keys (pnic, aggso, so). If one of these keys is present and the global property `CustomerSegment` is not already set within the `eventPayload` object, the extension sets `CustomerSegment` with a prefixed value corresponding to the key (e.g. "PNIC:", "AGGSO:" or "SO:"). This mechanism allows dynamic segmentation of customers based on query parameters which may have marketing or tracking implications.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables & Objects

- **Global Parameters:**
  - `eventType`: Used as the first argument in the self-executing function, however its role is minimal in the logic.
  - `eventPayload`: Passed as the second argument (named as `b`). This object is checked and mutated by adding the `CustomerSegment` property if applicable.
  
- **Local Variables:**
  - `a` and `b`: Named parameters representing `eventType` and `eventPayload` respectively.
  - `qs`: An object that stores key-value pairs parsed from the query string (converted to lower case for consistency).

### Logic Flow

1. **Initial Condition Check:**
   - The code first checks if `eventPayload.CustomerSegment` is not already defined.
   - It also verifies that the current page URL’s pathname contains the substring “/ccc/”. This condition ensures that the extension only executes its logic on specific pages.

2. **Query String Parsing:**
   - The code accesses the query string by using `window.location.search`, converts it to lowercase and extracts the portion after the “?”.
   - The query string is split using the “&” delimiter, then reduced into an object (`qs`) where each key is derived from the parameter name and each value is the decodeURIComponent of the corresponding parameter value.
   - Note: The parsing approach assumes that all query string parameters are well-formed with an equals (“=”) sign present in each component.

3. **Conditional Assignment:**
   - The code then checks if `qs` contains specific keys:
     - If `qs.pnic` is defined, it sets `eventPayload.CustomerSegment` to `"PNIC:"` concatenated with the value.
     - If `qs.aggso` is defined, it sets `eventPayload.CustomerSegment` to `"AGGSO:"` concatenated with the value.
     - If `qs.so` is defined, it sets `eventPayload.CustomerSegment` to `"SO:"` concatenated with the value.
   - These conditions are sequential and independent. If more than one parameter is present, the property will be overwritten by the last condition in the code flow (e.g. “so” takes precedence over “aggso” and “pnic”).

### Dependencies & External Objects

- **window.location:** The extension relies on the browser’s `window.location` object for retrieving the current URL.
- **Global objects:** The extension directly uses `eventType` and `eventPayload` which are provided by Tealium iQ. No external libraries beyond standard browser objects are utilised.
- **ES5 Syntax:** The code is written in ES5 compatible Javascript.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Normal Operation on a CCC Page
- **URL Example:** https://www.example.com/ccc/?pnic=12345  
- **Behaviour:**
  - The pathname contains “/ccc/”.
  - The query string includes the parameter “pnic”.
  - Since `eventPayload.CustomerSegment` is not already set, it is assigned the value "PNIC:12345".

### Scenario 2: Multiple Query Parameters Present
- **URL Example:** https://www.example.com/ccc/?pnic=12345&so=789  
- **Behaviour:**
  - The query string contains both “pnic” and “so”.  
  - Even though “pnic” is detected first, the condition for “so” executes later.
  - Final value of `eventPayload.CustomerSegment` becomes "SO:789".
  - The order of conditions matters as each condition can overwrite a previous assignment.

### Scenario 3: Non-CCC Page
- **URL Example:** https://www.example.com/nonccc/?aggso=456  
- **Behaviour:**
  - The pathname does not include “/ccc/”.
  - The extension does not execute its logic and `eventPayload.CustomerSegment` remains unchanged.
  
### Scenario 4: Edge Condition — Malformed Query String
- **URL Example:** https://www.example.com/ccc/?pnic=  
- **Behaviour:**
  - The query parameter “pnic” exists but may be empty.
  - The code will set `eventPayload.CustomerSegment` to "PNIC:" with an empty value.
  - No explicit error handling exists for missing or empty parameter values.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Overwriting Values:**
  - If multiple relevant query parameters are provided, the final property assigned is determined by the sequential ordering in the code. This may not be the desired behaviour in cases where multiple segments might need to be aggregated.

- **Query String Parsing Limitations:**
  - The approach assumes that every query parameter contains an equals (“=”) delimiter. In cases where a query parameter might be present without a value, this could potentially throw an error or yield unexpected outputs.
  
- **Case Sensitivity Preprocessing:**
  - The entire query string is lowercased. If there is a need to preserve the original casing for other parameters later in custom logic, this could become problematic.

- **Dependency on URL Structure:**
  - The extension only processes URLs with “/ccc/”. Any deviation in URL structure (e.g. trailing slashes, uppercase letters) may result in the extension not triggering as expected.

- **Potential Conflicts:**
  - Other Tealium extensions that manipulate `eventPayload.CustomerSegment` could conflict, especially if executed in different scopes or at different times in the load sequence.
  - Extensions that modify the query string or URL prior to this script running may interfere with the expected behaviour.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Ordering of Conditions:**
  - Consider adding logic to prioritise query parameters explicitly if multiple are present, rather than relying on the execution order.

- **Enhanced Query String Parsing:**
  - Implement additional checks to ensure that splitting on “=” produces both a key and a value. This could prevent potential errors from malformed query strings.

- **Modularisation:**
  - Extract the query string parsing logic into a separate ES5 compliant function. This promotes reusability and clarity in the overall code.

- **Commenting:**
  - Expand inline comments to document the purpose of each block of code. This is particularly helpful for future maintainers unfamiliar with the implementation.

- **Error Handling:**
  - Although defensive coding around the presence of `eventType` and `eventPayload` is not required, consider adding minimal error handling around the splitting and reduction logic to guard against unexpected query string formats.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**
  - Regularly review the extension’s compatibility with changes in the URL structures or query parameter naming conventions.
  - Monitor for any interaction effects with other extensions that modify the same global properties in `eventPayload`.

- **Testing Guidelines:**
  - Create unit tests or use browser-based testing tools to simulate various URL scenarios (normal, edge cases, multiple parameters).
  - Ensure that regression tests are in place after any refactoring to catch potential conflicts with other extensions.

- **Ownership & Versioning:**
  - Maintain version control of the extension code to track changes over time.
  - Assign a clear owner or maintainer for periodic reviews and documentation updates.

- **Documentation Updates:**
  - Update this documentation page alongside any code modifications to ensure consistency between implementation and documentation.
