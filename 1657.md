# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: Stupid Parties

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name**: Stupid Parties
- **ID**: 1657
- **Type**: JavaScript Code
- **Scope**: Before Load Rules
- **Execution Frequency**: Run Always

### Summary
The "Stupid Parties" extension is designed to manipulate the `RetailCustomerID` variable found in the incoming `eventPayload`. The extension's logic examines the `RetailCustomerID` for specific patterns and conditions, modifying or deleting it as necessary. This functionality ensures that any sensitive or malformed identifiers do not get passed through to downstream systems, thus maintaining data integrity.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- **`a`**: Represents the event type (not specifically used in the code).
- **`b`**: Represents the event payload object which contains incoming data, including `RetailCustomerID`.

### Logic Flow
1. **OCIS ID Processing**:
   - If `RetailCustomerID` contains the substring `-OCIS`, the code extracts and assigns the portion before this substring to `OCISID`, while removing `RetailCustomerID`.
  
2. **Unique Identifiers Handling**:
   - It deletes the `RetailCustomerID` if it matches either `"unique identifier"` or `"uniqueidentifier"`.

3. **Length Validation**:
   - If the length of `RetailCustomerID` exceeds 12 characters, it is deleted to avoid overly long identifiers.

### Global Objects and Dependencies
The extension relies on the `eventPayload` object, which is a standard part of the Tealium event processing context. No external libraries or other dependencies are utilized in this code block.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Condition
- **Input**: `eventPayload` contains `RetailCustomerID: "123-OCIS"`.
- **Processing**: 
  - Extracts `OCISID` as `"123"`.
  - Deletes `RetailCustomerID`.
- **Output**: `eventPayload` now has `OCISID: "123"` and no `RetailCustomerID`.

### Edge Conditions
- **Input**: `eventPayload` contains `RetailCustomerID: "unique identifier"`.
- **Processing**: 
  - Matches the exact string and deletes `RetailCustomerID`.
- **Output**: `eventPayload` has no `RetailCustomerID`.

- **Input**: `eventPayload` contains `RetailCustomerID: "This_is_a_very_long_identifier_12345"`.
- **Processing**: 
  - Length check exceeds 12 characters.
  - Deletes `RetailCustomerID`.
- **Output**: `eventPayload` has no `RetailCustomerID`.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Data Loss Potential**: If the `RetailCustomerID` contains unexpected patterns or exceeds pipeline limits, valid data might be deleted inadvertently, leading to loss of necessary information for downstream processes.
  
- **Edge Case Handling**: Specific handling for patterned identifiers like `-OCIS` may not work correctly if the identifier does not conform to expected formats, causing unprocessed identifiers.

- **Conflict with Other Extensions**: This extension may conflict with any other extensions that attempt to manipulate `RetailCustomerID`. Care should be taken to ensure that only one extension handles this key.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Readability Improvements**: 
  - Consider breaking down the logic into smaller functions to improve clarity (e.g., a function for each type of processing).
    
- **Commenting**: 
  - Include inline comments to describe the purpose and context for each logic branch, aiding future developers in understanding the flow.

- **Modularisation**: 
  - If possible, consider creating reusable functions for handling identifier formats to keep code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).

- **Error Handling**: 
  - While defensive coding isn't currently supported, logging or alert mechanisms could be incorporated in future iterations to notify about data deletion.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ownership**: Assign a specific team or individual for the ongoing maintenance of this extension. Regular reviews and updates should be scheduled, especially as related business requirements evolve.

- **Testing Guidelines**: 
  - Comprehensive testing should be performed whenever changes are made to ensure that expected behaviours are maintained and new edge cases do not break existing functionality. Automated tests are recommended if feasible to validate each condition.

- **Documentation Updates**: Ensure that any future modifications to this extension are reflected in this documentation to maintain clarity for developers and stakeholders. 

By adhering to this structured approach, the Stupid Parties extension can be maintained effectively while minimising risks and optimising data processing within Tealium iQ.
