# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: Stupid Parties

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Stupid Parties  
- **Extension ID:** 1657 (Library Extension ID: 100036)  
- **Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** Before Load Rules  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Always  

**Summary:**  
This extension is designed to process a specific customer identifier stored in the property “RetailCustomerID” from the Tealium event payload. It checks for particular formatting conditions and, based on the rules defined, either updates or deletes the property. The primary purpose is to extract an identifier (termed OCISID) from “RetailCustomerID” if it contains the substring “-OCIS”. Additionally, it cleans up the property for special placeholder values and excessively long identifiers.

------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- **eventType:** Passed in as the first parameter. Although not directly used in the extension’s logic, it is guaranteed to be present as part of the Tealium framework.  
- **eventPayload:** Passed in as the object (referred to as _b_ in the function) that holds all event data, from which the extension reads and modifies the property `RetailCustomerID`.

### Logic Flow

1. **Check for OCIS Format:**  
   - If a `RetailCustomerID` exists and, when converted to a string, contains the substring “-OCIS” (its position in the string index is greater than 0), then:  
     - It splits the `RetailCustomerID` using “-OCIS” as the delimiter.  
     - The first segment of the split (i.e. the part before “-OCIS”) is assigned to a new property called `OCISID`.  
     - The original `RetailCustomerID` property is then deleted from the event payload.

2. **Handle Specific Placeholder Values:**  
   - If `RetailCustomerID` exactly matches “unique identifier” or “uniqueidentifier”, it deletes `RetailCustomerID`.  
   - These checks ensure that placeholder values, which are not valid actual identifiers, are removed.

3. **Length Check:**  
   - If `RetailCustomerID` exists and its string representation has a length greater than 12, the property is deleted.  
   - This rule makes sure that any identifiers exceeding a typical length are not passed along further.

### Dependencies
- **Global Objects:**  
  The extension relies on two global objects provided by Tealium:
  - `eventType`  
  - `eventPayload`
  
  No external libraries or additional dependencies are used.

------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Usage Examples

### Example Scenario 1 – Valid OCIS Customer ID
- **Input EventPayload:**  
  `{ RetailCustomerID: "12345-OCIS67890" }`
- **Process Flow:**
  1. Checks if “12345-OCIS67890” contains “-OCIS”: condition fulfilled.
  2. Splits the string into [ "12345", "67890" ].  
  3. Sets `eventPayload.OCISID` to "12345".  
  4. Deletes `RetailCustomerID`.
- **Output EventPayload:**  
  `{ OCISID: "12345" }`

### Example Scenario 2 – Placeholder Values
- **Input EventPayload:**  
  `{ RetailCustomerID: "unique identifier" }`
- **Process Flow:**  
  1. The property exactly matches a placeholder string (“unique identifier”).
  2. Deletes `RetailCustomerID`.
- **Output EventPayload:**  
  `{ }`

### Example Scenario 3 – Excessively Long Identifier
- **Input EventPayload:**  
  `{ RetailCustomerID: "1234567890123" }`
- **Process Flow:**  
  1. The string length is greater than 12.
  2. Deletes `RetailCustomerID`.
- **Output EventPayload:**  
  `{ }`

### Example Scenario 4 – Standard Identifier with no Special Format
- **Input EventPayload:**  
  `{ RetailCustomerID: "123456789012" }`
- **Process Flow:**  
  1. No substring “-OCIS” is found and it is neither a placeholder nor exceeding length.
  2. `RetailCustomerID` remains intact.
- **Output EventPayload:**  
  `{ RetailCustomerID: "123456789012" }`

------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Potential Unintended Deletion:**  
  If `RetailCustomerID` is longer than 12 characters, even if it is a valid identifier in some contexts, it will be removed. Ensure that this rule is appropriate for your dataset.
  
- **Placeholder Values Hard-Coded:**  
  The extension only checks for two specific placeholder values (“unique identifier” and “uniqueidentifier”). Any variation in the placeholder (e.g. differing case or spacing) will not be caught.
  
- **Order of Checks Matters:**  
  The transformation for OCIS extraction runs before the checks for placeholder values or length. If the input meets multiple conditions, the first matching condition will determine the mutation, which could lead to unintended data removal.

- **Conflict with Other Extensions:**  
  Be cautious if other extensions later in the Tealium workflow depend on `RetailCustomerID` being present. Once deleted here, it might not be available further downstream.

------------------------------------------------------------

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Enhanced Defensive Checks:**  
  While eventType and eventPayload are assumed to be present, it might be beneficial to verify that eventPayload.RetailCustomerID is indeed a string before performing string-specific operations like indexOf or split. This would prevent runtime errors if data types ever change unexpectedly.

- **Modularise Common Logic:**  
  If similar transformations are needed in different parts of your Tealium implementation, consider isolating the OCIS extraction logic into a helper function. This makes the code easier to maintain and increases reusability.

- **Explicit Comments for Each Condition:**  
  Adding inline comments can help future maintainers quickly understand the purpose of each conditional block. This aids clarity, especially for complex data processing rules.

- **Boundary Condition Tests:**  
  Given the deletion rule for strings with length greater than 12, ensure there is a clear specification or comment explaining why such identifiers are considered invalid. This might help avoid inadvertent data loss during future revisions.

*Note: Avoid incorporating ES2015/ES6 code styles due to the requirement to support ES5.*

------------------------------------------------------------

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  - Regularly review the placeholder value checks to ensure they accommodate any new terminology or formatting that might be introduced in future business cases.
  - Validate the length check against evolving data standards or business requirements. Test the extension whenever updates are made to other parts of the Tealium setup, especially if changes in data structure are anticipated.

- **Ownership:**  
  - Assign a team member or group responsible for monitoring the performance and correctness of the extension.
  - Track any enhancements or bug fixes using an issue tracker in your version control system.

- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Perform unit testing for each branch of the logic (e.g., valid OCIS extraction, placeholder deletion, length-based deletion).
  - Test the extension in a staging environment with various sample payloads, ensuring that no unintended data is lost and that all expected data transformations occur.
  - Monitor runtime logs for any errors related to data types or missing properties, updating the extension as necessary.
