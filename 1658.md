# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name**: No Title
- **ID**: 1658
- **Type**: JavaScript Code
- **Scope**: After Load Rules
- **Execution Frequency**: Run Always

### Summary
This Tealium iQ extension is designed to assess the visibility of a cookie consent prompt to the user. It captures whether the cookie prompt has been seen by checking a property from the `LBGAnalytics` object, which presumably tracks user consent status. The information is stored in a variable `b.CookiePromptSeen`, allowing for further data handling in the digital marketing or analytics context.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- **a**: This parameter is accepted but not utilised in the current code logic.
- **b**: An object intended to be populated with the cookie prompt visibility status.

### Logic Flow
1. The extension first checks if the cookie consent prompt has been seen by accessing `LBGAnalytics.consents.seen`.
2. If the prompt is seen, it assigns the string "Seen" to `b.CookiePromptSeen`.
3. If it has not been seen, it assigns "Not Seen".

### Code Processing
```javascript
(function(a,b){
    b.CookiePromptSeen = LBGAnalytics.consents.seen ? "Seen" : "Not Seen"; 
})(eventType, eventPayload);
```
- The code uses an anonymous self-invoking function to encapsulate its logic, ensuring that the scope of `a` and `b` remains local.
- The value of `b.CookiePromptSeen` is dependent on the global object `LBGAnalytics`, specifically the `.consents.seen` property.

### Dependencies
- **LBGAnalytics**: This extension relies on the global `LBGAnalytics` object which should be instantiated and available in the global scope to function correctly. It is assumed to contain a `consents` object with a boolean `seen` property.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Condition
When a user has seen the cookie consent prompt:
- **Input**: `LBGAnalytics.consents.seen` is `true`.
- **Output**: `b.CookiePromptSeen` will be set to "Seen".

### Edge Condition
When the prompt has not been displayed yet:
- **Input**: `LBGAnalytics.consents.seen` is `false`.
- **Output**: `b.CookiePromptSeen` will be set to "Not Seen".

### Example Flow
```javascript
// Assuming LBGAnalytics.consents.seen is true
var eventPayload = {};
var eventType = 'pageview';
(function(a, b){
    b.CookiePromptSeen = LBGAnalytics.consents.seen ? "Seen" : "Not Seen"; 
})(eventType, eventPayload);
console.log(eventPayload.CookiePromptSeen); // Output: "Seen"
```

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Dependency on Global Object**: If `LBGAnalytics` is not defined or does not contain the expected `consents` structure, this code will throw an error. Ensure that the analytics library is loaded prior to this extension.
- **Missing State Handling**: The extension does not manage cases where `LBGAnalytics` or its `consents` property may be temporarily unavailable due to network or loading issues.
- **Lack of Comments**: The code currently lacks inline comments, which may lead to misunderstanding for future developers.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Code Style**: Consider adding comments to clarify the purpose of the condition checks for future maintainers.
- **Error Handling**: Although explicitly requested not to include defensive coding, consider implementing error handling should the global `LBGAnalytics` object or its properties be undefined.
- **Modularisation**: While the current structure suffices, breaking the logic out into a named function could enhance readability and facilitate testing.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance**: It is recommended to regularly check for updates or changes in the `LBGAnalytics` library, as changes in structure could lead to unintended consequences.
- **Ownership**: Assign a primary owner to manage updates or address issues related to this extension; this ensures continuity in the maintenance process.
- **Testing Guidelines**: Implement comprehensive tests based on typical user consent scenarios, ensuring the state is correctly reflected in `b.CookiePromptSeen`. Consider using unit tests to validate functionality after any changes are made to the extension.
