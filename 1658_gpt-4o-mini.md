# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name**: No Title
- **ID**: 100036
- **Type**: Javascript Code
- **Scope**: After Load Rules
- **Execution Frequency**: Run Always

### Summary
This extension is designed to determine whether a cookie prompt has been seen by the user. It checks a specific property from the `LBGAnalytics.consents` object and assigns a value based on the user's interaction with the cookie prompt. This information can be useful for analytics and personalisation efforts, helping teams to understand user consent regarding cookies.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- **LBGAnalytics.consents.seen**: A boolean flag indicating whether the cookie prompt has been seen by the user. 

### Logic Flow
1. The extension is immediately invoked with two parameters, `eventType` and `eventPayload`.
2. The code checks the value of `LBGAnalytics.consents.seen`.
3. Based on this value, it assigns a string ("Seen" or "Not Seen") to the property `CookiePromptSeen` on the `b` object, which is assumed to represent some form of event data.

### Dependencies
- The extension depends on the global `LBGAnalytics` object, specifically the `LBGAnalytics.consents` structure. If `LBGAnalytics` is not defined or if `consents.seen` is absent, this code will not function as intended.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Conditions
- **Scenario**: A user arrives at a webpage where the cookie prompt is displayed.
  - If the user has seen the prompt, `LBGAnalytics.consents.seen` is set to `true`.
  - The extension then sets `b.CookiePromptSeen` to "Seen".
  
- **Result**: The value of `b.CookiePromptSeen` will propagate to analytics tools, making it clear if the cookie prompt was seen.

### Edge Conditions
- **Scenario**: A user has never interacted with the cookie prompt.
  - If `LBGAnalytics.consents.seen` is `false`, then `b.CookiePromptSeen` will be set to "Not Seen".

- **Result**: This provides insight into how many users have not acknowledged the cookie prompt, aiding compliance and marketing strategies.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Dependency on Global Object**: If `LBGAnalytics` or `LBGAnalytics.consents` is not defined prior to running this extension, it will fail silently; no errors will be thrown, but `b.CookiePromptSeen` will remain undefined.
- **Conflicts with Other Extensions**: If other extensions manipulate the same `b` object or if `LBGAnalytics` is altered by another script, it can lead to unexpected results.
- **Non-standard Behaviour**: The extension does not account for scenarios where the `consents` structure might not exist or might contain unexpected types, which might lead to either incorrect assignments or failed executions.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

1. **Defensive Checks**: Although defensive coding is not a requirement for `eventType` and `eventPayload`, it would be prudent for `LBGAnalytics` and its properties to check for existence before accessing them, thus preventing runtime issues.
   - Example check:
     ```javascript
     if (LBGAnalytics && LBGAnalytics.consents) {
         b.CookiePromptSeen = LBGAnalytics.consents.seen ? "Seen" : "Not Seen";
     } else {
         b.CookiePromptSeen = "Data Not Available";
     }
     ```
   
2. **Code Style**: Consider adopting a consistent naming convention and indentation style for readability.
3. **Modularization**: If this extension needs to handle more data points or is likely to evolve, consider breaking it down into smaller functions for better maintainability.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ownership**: Assign a team member to own this extension for updates and troubleshooting.
- **Testing Guidelines**: 
  - Ensure the extension is tested in various conditions, especially scenarios where `LBGAnalytics` may or may not be present.
  - Monitor the output of `b.CookiePromptSeen` to confirm it behaves as expected across different user interactions.
- **Updates**: Keep up to date with changes in the `LBGAnalytics` library that may affect the functionality or logging of this extension.
