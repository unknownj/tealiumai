# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: "No Title"

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the "No Title" Tealium iQ extension, detailing its purpose, code logic, usage examples, known limitations, refactoring recommendations, and maintenance guidelines.

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** No Title  
- **ID:** 1658  
- **Extension ID:** 100036  
- **Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** After Load Rules  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Always  

### Summary

This extension sets the property "CookiePromptSeen" on the event payload based on the user's consent status found in the global object `LBGAnalytics`. Specifically, it checks whether the consent prompt has been seen by evaluating `LBGAnalytics.consents.seen` and assigns a string value ("Seen" or "Not Seen") accordingly. This mechanism allows downstream processes to condition behaviour or reporting based on whether the cookie prompt has been acknowledged.

---

## 2. Code Explanation

The extension code is as follows:

    (function(a,b){
        b.CookiePromptSeen = LBGAnalytics.consents.seen ? "Seen" : "Not Seen"; 
    })(eventType, eventPayload);

### Key Variables

- **a (eventType):**  
  Although the parameter `a` (alias for `eventType`) is passed to the function, it is not utilised within the code. This parameter could be reserved for potential future use or maintained for consistency with other extensions.

- **b (eventPayload):**  
  This parameter represents the event payload object that will be enriched with custom data. The extension assigns a new property `CookiePromptSeen` to this object.

### Logic Flow

1. **Invocation:**  
   The self-executing anonymous function is invoked immediately with the parameters `eventType` and `eventPayload`.

2. **Consent Check & Assignment:**  
   Inside the function, the code accesses the global object `LBGAnalytics` and checks the value of `LBGAnalytics.consents.seen`:
   - If `LBGAnalytics.consents.seen` evaluates to true, `eventPayload.CookiePromptSeen` is set to "Seen".
   - If false, it is set to "Not Seen".

### Dependencies

- **Global Object:**  
  The code depends on the global object `LBGAnalytics`, specifically on the property `consents.seen`. It assumes that:
  - `LBGAnalytics` is defined in the global scope.
  - The property `consents` exists on `LBGAnalytics` and contains the attribute `seen`.

- **Tealium Environment:**  
  The extension leverages Tealium iQ's event model by using the `eventType` and `eventPayload` parameters, which are guaranteed to be present in the environment where the extension runs.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Scenario

- **Case:** The user has interacted with the cookie prompt.
- **Assumption:** `LBGAnalytics.consents.seen` is `true`.
- **Behaviour:**
  - The code evaluates the condition as true.
  - `eventPayload.CookiePromptSeen` is set to "Seen".
- **Outcome:** Downstream processes reading the event payload will see `"CookiePromptSeen": "Seen"` and can act accordingly.

### Edge Scenario

- **Case:** The user has not interacted with the cookie prompt.
- **Assumption:** `LBGAnalytics.consents.seen` is `false`.
- **Behaviour:**
  - The condition evaluates as false.
  - `eventPayload.CookiePromptSeen` is set to "Not Seen".
- **Outcome:** This indicates that the user has not seen the cookie prompt, which might trigger additional prompts or alter analytics reporting.

### Data Flow Illustration

1. **Input:**  
   - `eventType`: Provided by Tealium (not used in this extension).  
   - `eventPayload`: An object that can be enriched with data.

2. **Processing:**  
   - The extension checks the global consent status.
   - It enriches `eventPayload` with a new property `CookiePromptSeen` based on the consent state.

3. **Output:**  
   - The modified `eventPayload` object is passed along to subsequent processes within Tealium for analytics tracking or further customisation.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Dependency on Global Object:**  
  The extension relies on `LBGAnalytics` being defined and properly initialised. If this global object or the `consents` property is unavailable or misconfigured, the extension may not behave as expected.

- **Unused Parameter:**  
  The `eventType` parameter is passed into the function but is not utilised. If future extensions build on this code, the parameter usage may need clarification or removal for clarity.

- **Potential Conflicts:**  
  - If other Tealium extensions or external scripts attempt to modify `eventPayload.CookiePromptSeen`, it could lead to conflicts or overwrites.
  - Ensure that no other script uses a similar naming convention for properties on `eventPayload`.

- **Scope and Timing:**  
  Since the extension is set to run "After Load Rules" and "Run Always", ensure that any dependency on global objects like `LBGAnalytics` is met at the point this extension executes.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Improved Readability:**
  - Consider renaming the function parameters from generic names (a, b) to more descriptive names (e.g., eventType, eventPayload) within the function body. This will enhance readability and maintainability.
  
- **Modularisation:**
  - If additional logic is expected to be added in the future, modularising the code by extracting the consent check into a helper function could improve maintainability.
  
- **Documentation within Code:**
  - Inline comments can be added to clarify the purpose of key operations, especially the dependency on `LBGAnalytics`.
  
- **Error Handling:**
  - Although defensive coding for the availability of `eventType` and `eventPayload` is not required, consider logging or handling cases where `LBGAnalytics` or `LBGAnalytics.consents.seen` might not be available in environments that could be less predictable.

- **Consistent Naming:**
  - Align property names (e.g. `CookiePromptSeen`) with organisational coding standards to ensure consistency across extensions.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**
  - Regularly verify that the global object `LBGAnalytics` and its property structure remain consistent, especially if other teams manage these components.
  - Monitor usage in production to ensure that consumers of the `CookiePromptSeen` flag are correctly responding to its values.

- **Ownership:**
  - Define clear ownership and code review responsibilities for this extension. Changes in related systems (such as consent management frameworks) should trigger a review of this code to ensure continued compatibility.

- **Testing Guidelines:**
  - Include unit tests (where applicable in the Tealium environment) to verify that `eventPayload.CookiePromptSeen` is assigned the correct value based on different states of `LBGAnalytics.consents.seen`.
  - Automate tests to run in both scenarios (consent seen and not seen) to prevent regressions.

- **Documentation Updates:**
  - Update this documentation as part of regular code reviews to reflect any changes in dependencies, usage, or configuration of the extension.
  - Share this documentation with relevant teams to ensure clarity on how the extension works and any potential impacts on wider analytics implementations.
