# Event Stream Data Source Extension Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive overview, code explanation, usage examples, known limitations, refactoring recommendations, and maintenance guidelines for the "Event Stream Data Source" Tealium iQ extension.

---

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Event Stream Data Source  
- **ID:** 1659 (internal Tealium iQ extension ID: 100036)  
- **Type:** JavaScript Code  
- **Scope:** 1459  
- **Execution Frequency:** Executes once per tag event (invoked as part of the event processing in Tealium iQ)

**Summary:**  
This extension sets the data source identifier property (tealium_datasource) on the event payload (accessible via the eventPayload object) based on the environment and brand conditions. It primarily differentiates between development/QA environments (using a fixed test-datasource) and production-like conditions. Further, within production, it distinguishes between Webview and non-Webview contexts, assigning a unique data source identifier for each brand accordingly.

---

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables

- **a:** Represents `eventType` (unused in this specific logic, but passed as an argument).
- **b:** Represents `eventPayload`, the object carrying event data and properties needed for condition checking (e.g., environment, brand, Webview status).
- **u:** Represents `tagObject` (not explicitly used in the logic).

### Logic Flow

1. **Development and QA Environment Check:**  
   The first condition checks if the environment variable (`b["ut.env"]`) is equal to `"dev"` or `"qa"`. If so, the property `tealium_datasource` on `eventPayload` is set to `"i19fjp"`. This allows testing and development events to be routed to a separate data source.

2. **Production Condition - Non-Webview:**  
   If the environment is not development/QA, the code then evaluates whether the event is coming from a standard (non-Webview) context using the property `b.WebviewDetected === false`.  
   - For brand `"Lloyds"`, `tealium_datasource` is set to `"9jlcvk"`.  
   - For brand `"Halifax"`, it is set to `"ggb62r"`.  
   - For brand `"BOS"`, it is set to `"x5ubve"`.  
   - For brand `"MBNA"`, it is set to `"1x364w"`.  
   - For any brand that includes the substring `"scottish"` (case insensitive check via `toLowerCase()`), it is set to `"3u9wrh"`.

3. **Production Condition - Webview:**  
   Else, if `b.WebviewDetected === true` (indicating a Webview context), similar brand checks are performed with different datasource values:
   - For brand `"Lloyds"`, `tealium_datasource` is set to `"wbwgsq"`.  
   - For brand `"Halifax"`, it is set to `"l3ngc9"`.  
   - For brand `"BOS"`, it is set to `"3r7dyw"`.  
   - For brand `"MBNA"`, it is set to `"uvbir8"`.  
   - For any brand that includes the substring `"scottish"` (case insensitive), it is set to `"4abplt"`.

### Dependencies and Global Objects

- Relies on properties within the `eventPayload` object (`b`):
  - `b["ut.env"]`: To determine if the event originates from a development or QA environment.
  - `b.Brand`: To identify the brand and select the corresponding data source.
  - `b.WebviewDetected`: To determine if the event is coming from a Webview context.
- The function is encapsulated as an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) and uses three parameters: `eventType`, `eventPayload`, and `tagObject`.  
- No external libraries are used; the code uses plain ES5-compliant JavaScript.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Development or QA Environment

- **Input:**  
  `eventPayload["ut.env"] = "dev"` (or `"qa"`)  
- **Processing:**  
  The first `if` condition is met.  
- **Outcome:**  
  `eventPayload.tealium_datasource` is set to `"i19fjp"`, regardless of the brand or Webview status.

### Scenario 2: Production Environment (Non-Webview) and Specific Brand

- **Input:**  
  `eventPayload["ut.env"] = "prod"` (or unspecified non-dev/qa value),  
  `eventPayload.WebviewDetected = false`,  
  `eventPayload.Brand = "Lloyds"`
- **Processing:**  
  The extension checks that it is not in a dev/qa environment and that Webview is not detected.  
- **Outcome:**  
  `eventPayload.tealium_datasource` is set to `"9jlcvk"`.

### Scenario 3: Production Environment (Webview) and Specific Brand

- **Input:**  
  `eventPayload["ut.env"] = "prod"`,  
  `eventPayload.WebviewDetected = true`,  
  `eventPayload.Brand = "BOS"`
- **Processing:**  
  The extension checks for a Webview condition and matches the brand `"BOS"`.  
- **Outcome:**  
  `eventPayload.tealium_datasource` is set to `"3r7dyw"`.

### Scenario 4: Production Environment with a Brand Incorporating "scottish"

- **Input:**  
  `eventPayload["ut.env"] = "prod"`,  
  `eventPayload.WebviewDetected = (true or false)`,  
  `eventPayload.Brand = "Scottish Widows"`.
- **Processing:**  
  - The code converts `eventPayload.Brand` to lowercase and checks if it contains `"scottish"`.  
  - Depending on whether Webview is true or false, the corresponding datasource is set:
    - If `WebviewDetected` is false: datasource `"3u9wrh"`.
    - If `WebviewDetected` is true: datasource `"4abplt"`.
- **Outcome:**  
  The appropriate datasource is set based on the Webview context.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Brand String Matching:**  
  - The logic depends on exact string comparisons for brand names (e.g., `"Lloyds"`, `"Halifax"`, etc.).  
  - For the "scottish" check, the code uses a `toLowerCase()` conversion with `indexOf`; this may lead to unexpected behaviour if the brand string does not follow expected patterns.
  
- **Overlapping Conditions:**  
  - The extension uses multiple independent `if` statements within each branch (non-Webview and Webview). If a brand string partially matches more than one condition, there is a risk of inadvertently overwriting `tealium_datasource` if not structured properly. It is assumed that only one condition will be true per execution.
  
- **Dependence on Global Properties:**  
  - The code assumes that `eventPayload` always contains valid values for `"ut.env"`, `Brand`, and `WebviewDetected`. Missing or unexpected types/formats of these properties could lead to unexpected results.
  
- **Assumptions on Boolean Values:**  
  - The code expects `WebviewDetected` to be a strict boolean (`true` or `false`). Any deviation (e.g. `undefined` or a string `"false"`) might bypass the intended logic.

- **Potential Conflicts:**  
  - If other Tealium iQ extensions or external scripts modify the same properties (e.g. `tealium_datasource`), the resulting data source value may not be as intended.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Improve Conditional Structure:**  
  - Consider using an `if/else if/else` chain to ensure that only one condition applies per execution. This can help avoid accidental overwrites when multiple conditions might be inadvertently met.

- **Modularisation:**  
  - Refactor the repeated brand-based logic into a helper function (within the constraints of ES5) to encapsulate the mapping from brand to datasource. For example, a function that takes the brand and a flag indicating Webview status and returns the appropriate datasource string.

- **Defensive Coding:**  
  - Although defensive checks for `eventType` and `eventPayload` are not required, it may be beneficial to include basic validation or logging (as comments or additional monitoring mechanisms) for the expected properties such as `Brand` and `WebviewDetected`.

- **Code Style:**  
  - Maintain consistent indentation and spacing for readability.  
  - Consider adding inline comments to explain the reasoning behind each block, especially where multiple brand checks occur.

- **Configuration Externalisation:**  
  - If the brand-to-datasource mapping might change in the future, consider storing these mappings in an external configuration, which can then be referenced inside the extension. This can simplify future maintenance without changing the core logic.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  - Regularly review and update the brand mappings if new brands are added or identifiers change.  
  - Monitor logs or event data to ensure that the correct datasources are being applied consistently across environments.

- **Ownership & Testing Guidelines:**  
  - It is recommended that a designated team member or stakeholder maintain the extension documentation and configuration mappings.  
  - Develop a suite of test cases (both automated and manual) to cover every branch of the logic including development, production, non-Webview, and Webview contexts.
  - Document any changes to the environment variables or event properties in the projectâ€™s changelog to ensure cross-team awareness.

- **Documentation Review:**  
  - Update this documentation alongside any code changes. Ensure that stakeholders are aware of the dependencies and any potential points of failure.
  - Include version numbers and dates in both the code comments and documentation for easier tracking of modifications.
