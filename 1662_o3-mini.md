# ContentSquare Masking Extension Documentation

This document provides a detailed overview and explanation of the ContentSquare Masking extension for Tealium iQ. It covers its purpose, internal code logic, practical usage examples, known limitations, recommendations for refactoring, and maintenance guidelines.

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** ContentSquare Masking
- **ID:** 100036 (Extension), 1662 (Internal)
- **Type:** Javascript Code
- **Scope:** 1471
- **Execution Frequency:** Executed for each event when the Tealium tag is fired (as determined by tag configuration and corresponding load rules)

**Summary:**  
This extension configures masking rules for ContentSquare by defining a list of CSS selectors targeting potentially sensitive elements on the page. In addition, it conditionally enables a feature called “Replay” on specific hostnames associated with various banking and financial websites. The replay functionality is triggered if the current window’s hostname matches any of the hardcoded domains. This ensures that user data is appropriately masked and that replay behaviour is enabled only on trusted domains, enhancing both data privacy and user session replay capabilities.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables and Global Objects

- **window._uxa**:  
  - Acts as the global array (or is initialised as such) to store configuration commands for ContentSquare.  
  - The code pushes an object to `_uxa` with a method name `setPIISelectors` along with an array of CSS selectors that represent elements to be masked.

- **tagObject (parameter "b")**:  
  - It is used to set properties such as `b.EnableReplay`.  
  - This object is expected to be available in the execution environment and is used to configure additional capabilities (for example, enabling replay on particular domains).

- **eventType and eventPayload (parameters "a" and "eventPayload")**:  
  - While these are guaranteed to be present, this extension does not process these values further. They represent the current event context.

### Logic Flow

1. **Initialisation of ContentSquare Masking**:  
   - Checks if the global variable `_uxa` exists; if not, it creates an empty array.  
   - Pushes a configuration object that contains the command `'setPIISelectors'` along with an object that holds an array (`PIISelectors`) of CSS selectors.  
   - These selectors target HTML elements such as those with classes `.tl-mask`, `.tl-lvl1`, `.tl-lvl2`, elements with specific ID or class substrings, and certain navigation elements. This configuration is intended to mask any information that could be considered personally identifiable information (PII).

2. **Conditional Enabling of Replay Functionality (b.EnableReplay)**:  
   - The script checks if the current page's hostname matches one of several predefined domains (e.g., "www.lloydsbank.com", "www.halifax.co.uk", etc.).  
   - For each match, it sets `b.EnableReplay = true`, thus enabling the session replay feature on those domains.

3. **Commented Out Conditions for Edge Cases**:  
   - There is an additional block (commented out) that seems intended for a journey replay based on other conditions (using a hypothetical `LBGAnalytics.Q` function to query conditions like hostname or pathname parts).  
   - A flag `journeyReplay` is declared and, if set to true (by the commented conditions), would also set `b.EnableReplay = true`.

### Dependencies

- **Global Objects:**  
  - `window`: The script directly manipulates the global `window` object to access or initialise `_uxa`.
  - `tagObject`: Passed in as parameter `b`, likely representing a configuration object provided by the Tealium environment.
  
- **External Conditions:**  
  - The extension assumes that relevant CSS selectors exist on the page.
  - It depends on the proper configuration of the Tealium environment to supply the parameters (eventType, eventPayload, tagObject).

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Operation

- **Scenario:** User visits "www.lloydsbank.com".
  - The script examines `window.location.hostname`.  
  - Since the hostname matches "www.lloydsbank.com", it sets `b.EnableReplay = true`.
  - The ContentSquare configuration is pushed to `window._uxa`, instructing it to mask elements matching the defined selectors.
  - **Result:** Sensitive elements on the page are masked while the replay feature is enabled.

### Edge Conditions

- **Scenario:** User visits a website not included in the hardcoded hostname list.
  - The domain does not match any `if` condition, so `b.EnableReplay` remains unchanged.
  - The ContentSquare masking configuration is still applied (i.e. the selectors are pushed to `window._uxa`), ensuring that masking is consistently applied.
  - **Result:** Replay functionality is disabled, but the content masking takes place as planned.

- **Scenario:** Journey replay conditions are needed.
  - There is commented-out code to handle alternate conditions that check the URL pathname or query using a hypothetical analytics function.
  - If these conditions were enabled and fulfilled (i.e. if `journeyReplay` were set to `true`), then `b.EnableReplay` would be set to `true`.
  - **Result:** Replay functionality would be enabled, providing an example of how to extend functionality based on additional criteria.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Hostname Restrictions & Hardcoding:**  
  - The current implementation hardcodes the domain names where replay should be enabled. Any change in the domain structure may require an update of this list.
  - There are commented-out condition checks for certain domains (e.g. "www.markets.iweb-sharedealing.co.uk", "www.cavendishonline.co.uk") due to Content Security Policy (CSP) restrictions. Special handling may be needed for sites with stringent CSP requirements.

- **Limited Conditional Logic:**  
  - The journey replay logic is present but commented out. If extended or re-enabled, ensure that the function `LBGAnalytics.Q` is defined and that its use does not conflict with other extensions or scripts.
  
- **Dependency on Global Variables:**  
  - The reliance on the global `window._uxa` array means that if another script modifies this array unexpectedly, it could lead to misconfiguration or race conditions.

- **ES5 Compatibility:**  
  - The code is written in ES5 JavaScript. Future refactoring for performance or readability should be carefully balanced against the requirement to maintain ES5 compatibility.

- **Order of Execution:**  
  - Ensure that this extension executes at the proper point in the Tealium tag sequence so that global objects and required variables are already defined.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks:**  
  - Although eventType and eventPayload are guaranteed to exist, consider adding checks to ensure that `tagObject` (parameter "b") and its properties (e.g. `EnableReplay`) exist before setting them, to safeguard against future changes in the execution environment.

- **Modularisation:**  
  - Extract the list of CSS selectors and domain names into separate configuration files or objects. This would make the extension easier to update without digging into the code.

- **Improved Readability:**  
  - Consider breaking the code into functions for clarity. For example, a dedicated function to initialise ContentSquare masking and another to handle enabling the replay feature.
  - Add inline comments to explain the rationale behind certain domain checks (especially where the code has commented-out logic due to CSP restrictions).

- **Consistent Documentation:**  
  - Maintain an up-to-date internal documentation block within the code listing version changes and reasoning behind commented-out sections.

- **Testing Enhancements:**  
  - Write unit tests that simulate different hostname environments to verify that `b.EnableReplay` is correctly set.
  - Consider logging (to a debug console) in development environments to trace when each conditional branch is executed.

*Note: Do not upgrade syntax to ES6 or later constructs to ensure ES5 compatibility.*

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  - Regularly review the list of domain names in the conditional checks to ensure they remain current.
  - Monitor browser console logs for any errors related to ContentSquare masking or replay functionality after updates to the website or Tealium configuration.

- **Ownership & Version Control:**  
  - Store this extension and its documentation in a version-controlled repository (e.g. GitHub).
  - Ensure that code comments and commit messages clearly document any changes made to the extension, especially in response to external changes (e.g. updated domain names, changes in CSP policies).

- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Perform cross-browser testing to ensure that the masking selectors work as intended across all target browsers.
  - Use a staging environment to test changes before pushing them to production.
  - Validate that enabling/disabling replay functionality interacts correctly with other Tealium extensions and scripts.

- **Stakeholder Communication:**  
  - Share this documentation with relevant stakeholders (developers, QA, and data privacy teams) to ensure everyone is aware of the extension’s purpose and functionality.
  - Update documentation promptly when changes are made to the extension for transparency and future reference.
