# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** ContentSquare Self Hosting Code
- **ID:** 1664
- **Type:** Javascript Code
- **Scope:** 1471
- **Execution Frequency:** On every event that matches the conditions (currently no conditions specified)

### Summary
This extension is responsible for loading the appropriate ContentSquare tag dynamically based on the value of the `EnableCSNext` flag in the event payload. It ensures that the relevant JavaScript file is fetched by constructing the base URL using the Tealium Universal Tag ID (UTID) and a conditional tag identifier.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables:
- **LBGAnalytics.cs**: An object that serves as a namespace for storing the data layer and a flag to check if the script has already been loaded.
- **tagId**: A variable that determines which tag to load based on the `b.EnableCSNext` boolean. It is assigned the value "1649" if true and "1474" if false.
- **u.data.base_url**: The constructed URL for the ContentSquare tag.

### Logic Flow:
1. The function immediately checks if `LBGAnalytics.cs.loaded` is false. If so, it sets this flag to true.
2. The value of `tagId` is set based on the `EnableCSNext` property from the payload (`b`).
3. The `base_url` for loading the script is constructed using the tag ID and the UTID from the configuration (`utag.cfg.utid`).
4. The script is then ready to be loaded by the Tealium system.

### Dependencies:
- This extension depends on:
  - `eventType`: Presumably a string representing the event type triggering the extension.
  - `eventPayload`: An object containing event details, specifically the `EnableCSNext` property.
  - `tagObject` (u): A global object used for managing or sending tag data.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Scenario:
1. If `EnableCSNext` is true:
   - The extension runs and sets `tagId` to "1649".
   - The final URL generated would be: `https://tags.tiqcdn.com/utag/lbg/main/dev/utag.1649.js?{utid}`.
  
2. If `EnableCSNext` is false:
   - The extension sets `tagId` to "1474".
   - The final URL generated would be: `https://tags.tiqcdn.com/utag/lbg/main/dev/utag.1474.js?{utid}`.

### Edge Conditions:
- If `LBGAnalytics.cs.loaded` is true (it means the script has already been loaded), the extension will not attempt to load the URL again.
- If `EnableCSNext` is undefined or the property does not exist in `eventPayload`, it would default to loading `tagId` as "1474", since it does not explicitly handle this case.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Condition Absence**: Currently, there are no conditions specified, which implies that the extension will execute on every event. This could lead to unnecessary loads if not handled correctly in a wider application context.
- **Global Namespace Pollution**: The extension introduces `LBGAnalytics.cs` into the global scope, which might conflict with other scripts or extensions using the same namespace.
- **No Error Handling**: There is a lack of error handling for scenarios where the content pulling may fail (e.g., network errors).
- **Hardcoded URLs**: The base URL is hardcoded. It should ideally be configurable through the Tealium UI to allow for easy updates without code changes.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks**: Although not required for `eventType` and `eventPayload`, it might still be useful to add checks for the existence of the properties within `eventPayload` to ensure reliability.
- **Modularisation**: Consider encapsulating the URL construction logic in its own function for clearer separation of concerns and easier testing.
- **Avoid Global Namespace Usage**: Use a closure or an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) to avoid polluting the global namespace wherever possible.
- **Simplify Logic**: The logic could be simplify the logic flow, removing the redundant JSON parse/stringify for `b`, if it only needs to be stored as is.
  
## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance**: Regularly review the list of tag IDs and their corresponding configurations to ensure that the latest IDs are being used and deprecated ones are removed.
- **Ownership**: Assign a primary developer responsible for maintaining this extension. They should regularly check for any changes in requirements regarding ContentSquare integration.
- **Testing Guidelines**: Regularly test the extension on various browsers/environments to ensure that loading behaves as expected; specifically, validate the correct tag is fetched with both scenarios (true/false) for `EnableCSNext`.
- **Documentation Update**: Ensure this documentation stays up to date with any changes made in the code or logic to accommodate maintenance.
