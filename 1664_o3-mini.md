# ContentSquare Self Hosting Code Extension Documentation

This document provides an in-depth explanation, usage examples, and recommendations for the "ContentSquare Self Hosting Code" Tealium iQ extension.

---

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** ContentSquare Self Hosting Code  
- **Extension ID:** 100036 (Internal ID: 1664)  
- **Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** 1471  
- **Execution Frequency:**  
  - The code executes once per page/event load as determined by the Tealium tag management settings. The internal flag (LBGAnalytics.cs.loaded) ensures that the internal logic runs only a single time.

**Summary:**  
This extension is designed to integrate ContentSquare via self-hosting by dynamically setting the appropriate script URL based on the provided event payload. It clones the incoming data payload to ensure subsequent manipulations within the LBGAnalytics.cs object do not affect the original data. Furthermore, it conditionally determines the tag identifier based on the `EnableCSNext` flag, setting up the proper tag URL for fetching the ContentSquare script.

---

## 2. Code Explanation

The extension code is encapsulated in an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) with three parameters:
- **a (eventType):** Although not directly utilised within the code, it is passed to the function.
- **b (eventPayload):** The payload object containing data for processing, including the `EnableCSNext` flag.
- **u (tagObject):** An object whose properties are altered to point to the appropriate ContentSquare script URL.

### Key Variables & Logic Flow

1. **Global Object Initialization:**
   - The code utilises the global object `LBGAnalytics`.
   - A new property `cs` is added if it does not exist; it contains a deep clone of the event payload (`b`).  
     ```javascript
     LBGAnalytics.cs = LBGAnalytics.cs || {
         datalayer: JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(b))
     };
     ```
   - The cloning uses `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(b))` to create a deep copy, ensuring original payload data remains unchanged.

2. **Tag Identifier Selection:**
   - The variable `tagId` is set based on the `EnableCSNext` flag found in the event payload:
     - If `b.EnableCSNext` is truthy, `tagId` is set to `"1649"`.
     - Otherwise, it is set to `"1474"`.
     ```javascript
     var tagId = b.EnableCSNext ? "1649" : "1474";
     ```

3. **Conditional Loading Check:**
   - The flag `LBGAnalytics.cs.loaded` prevents reloading of the script:
     - If not already loaded, it sets the flag to `true`.
     - It then configures `u.data.base_url` to reference the correct ContentSquare script.
   - The URL is constructed using a base string concatenated with `tagId` and appended with a query parameter taken from `utag.cfg.utid` (assumed to be available on the global `utag.cfg` object):
     ```javascript
     if(!LBGAnalytics.cs.loaded){
       LBGAnalytics.cs.loaded = true;
       u.data.base_url = "https://tags.tiqcdn.com/utag/lbg/main/dev/utag." + tagId + ".js?" + utag.cfg.utid;
     }
     ```

### Dependencies on Global Objects/Libraries

- **LBGAnalytics:**  
  The code attaches properties to the global `LBGAnalytics` object. This dependency implies that `LBGAnalytics` must be defined in the global scope.

- **utag.cfg:**  
  The code references `utag.cfg.utid` for constructing the script URL. This ensures proper cache busting or versioning based on the utag configuration.

- **Event Variables:**  
  The parameters `eventType`, `eventPayload`, and `tagObject` are assumed to be provided correctly by Tealium, with the noted guarantee of their presence.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: EnableCSNext is True
- **Input (eventPayload):**
  ```javascript
  {
      EnableCSNext: true,
      // other properties...
  }
  ```
- **Behaviour:**
  - `tagId` is set to `"1649"`.
  - If `LBGAnalytics.cs.loaded` is not set, it is set to `true`.
  - `tagObject.data.base_url` becomes:
    ```
    https://tags.tiqcdn.com/utag/lbg/main/dev/utag.1649.js?<utid_value>
    ```
  - The deep copy of the payload is stored in `LBGAnalytics.cs.datalayer`.

### Scenario 2: EnableCSNext is False or Undefined
- **Input (eventPayload):**
  ```javascript
  {
      // EnableCSNext is either false or not present,
      // other properties...
  }
  ```
- **Behaviour:**
  - `tagId` is set to `"1474"`.
  - On the first execution (i.e. if `LBGAnalytics.cs.loaded` is false), the script URL is constructed accordingly:
    ```
    https://tags.tiqcdn.com/utag/lbg/main/dev/utag.1474.js?<utid_value>
    ```
  - Subsequent invocations will not alter the URL due to the `loaded` flag.

### Edge Conditions
- **Multiple Executions:**  
  The `LBGAnalytics.cs.loaded` flag ensures that even if the extension is triggered multiple times, the script URL is configured only once.
  
- **Missing EnableCSNext:**  
  If the `EnableCSNext` property is not defined in the payload, the extension defaults to the tag ID `"1474"`.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Single Execution:**  
  The use of a global loaded flag (`LBGAnalytics.cs.loaded`) means the code block executes only once. This design works for single-page events but might require reconsideration in scenarios where reinitialisation is expected.

- **Global Dependency on LBGAnalytics:**  
  The extension assumes that `LBGAnalytics` is defined in the global scope. If another extension or script unintentionally overrides or misconfigures this object, it could affect the behaviour of this extension.

- **Dependency on utag.cfg.utid:**  
  The script URL relies on `utag.cfg.utid`. If `utag.cfg` is not properly initialised or the `utid` property is missing, the URL may be malformed, potentially leading to a failed script load.

- **Deep Clone Method:**  
  The cloning of `eventPayload` using JSON methods might lead to data loss if the payload contains functions, undefined values, or non-serialisable objects.

- **Potential Conflicts:**  
  - Conflicts may arise with other Tealium extensions that modify `LBGAnalytics` or `utag.cfg`.
  - Ensure consistent variable naming to avoid collisions with other scripts that may use a similarly named global flag.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Modularisation:**  
  Consider wrapping the code in a dedicated namespace (if ES5 standards are to be maintained) to reduce the potential for global namespace pollution.

- **Error Handling:**  
  Implement basic error handling around critical operations (e.g., the JSON cloning process) to ensure that the extension does not silently fail if unexpected data types are encountered.

- **Documentation Updates:**  
  Enhance inline code comments to guide future developers on the intent and usage of key variables and logic.

- **Optimisation:**  
  While ES5 constraints must be adhered to, consider refactoring the deep clone logic if performance issues are observed. Alternatively, explicitly document any known limitations with using `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(b))`.

- **Configuration Flexibility:**  
  If future requirements necessitate dynamic script paths or additional parameters, consider externalising the configuration into a separate object that can be more easily modified without reviewing the core logic.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Monitoring:**  
  Periodically review the integration with ContentSquare, especially if there are upstream changes in the ContentSquare self-hosting scripts or Tealium configurations.

- **Ownership & Testing:**  
  - Assign responsibility to a specific team or individual for the upkeep of this extension.
  - As part of the deployment process, include tests to ensure that:
    - The deep clone correctly replicates the payload.
    - The conditional logic for tag ID selection functions as expected.
    - The global flags are correctly set and prevent multiple loadings.

- **Version Control:**  
  Maintain version history in source control (e.g. GitHub) and use detailed commit messages for any changes.

- **Documentation Updates:**  
  Update this documentation with each significant change to the extension code, ensuring that both current functionality and any known issues are well documented for future developers.
