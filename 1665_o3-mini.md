## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Contentsquare Load Rule  
- **ID:** 1665  
- **Extension ID:** 100036  
- **Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** Before Load Rules  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Always  

**Summary:**  
The extension controls the loading and configuration of the Contentsquare analytics tool based on several conditions. It dynamically sets flags (e.g. b.EnableCS, b.EnableCSNext, b.EnableCSPreprod) and prepares the configuration object (window.CS_CONF) based on the current URL, hostname, and feature flags in the LBGAnalytics global object. The logic ensures:
- Certain URL path segments (like "savingsidc" or "/idv/") disable Contentsquare.
- Specific hostnames and query parameters trigger the enabling of the tool.
- Conditions such as a defined data masking meta tag boost the replay-related feature flag.
- The configuration is further customised based on the brand (using b.Brand) with mapping provided by brandToProject and brandToInfrastructure objects.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables

- **Global Objects:**  
  - `window`: Used to access global properties like `window.location` and `window.CS_CONF`.  
  - `LBGAnalytics.featureFlags`: Holds feature flag values controlling the extension logic (e.g. `Contentsquare`, `ContentsquareReplay`).  

- **Input Parameters:**  
  - `eventType` (passed as parameter a)
  - `eventPayload` (passed as parameter b and is used as a container for flags and brand settings)  

- **Flag Variables:**  
  - `b.EnableCS`: Determines whether standard Contentsquare code should be enabled.  
  - `b.EnableCSNext`, `b.EnableCSPreprod`: Additional flags used for pre-production configurations.  

- **Brand Configuration Objects:**  
  - `brandToProject`: Maps brand names (and environment keys such as "PreProd" or "Default") to Contentsquare project IDs.  
  - `brandToInfrastructure`: Maps brand names to the underlying infrastructure (Azure or AWS) which influences the configuration endpoints.

### Logic Flow

1. **Initial URL Path Checks:**
   - The extension first checks if the URL pathname contains the string "savingsidc" or "/idv/".  
   - If either condition is met, it disables Contentsquare (`b.EnableCS = false`) and exits early.

2. **Feature Flags Check:**
   - Next, the extension reads from `LBGAnalytics.featureFlags.Contentsquare`.
     - If true, it ensures Contentsquare is enabled (`b.EnableCS = true`).
     - If explicitly false, it disables Contentsquare by setting `b.EnableCS` to undefined and exits.
   - It further checks for the presence of data masking via a global variable (`window.LBGDataMasking`) or a meta tag, which if found, flags `ContentsquareReplay`.

3. **Hostname-Based Conditions:**
   - The extension tests multiple hostname conditions to decide whether to enable Contentsquare.
   - For a set of primary hostnames, additional restrictions on URL paths (e.g. paths starting with "/private", "/international", or "/business") are applied.
   - A separate group of secure hostnames is also checked and if matched, Contentsquare is enabled.
   - Lastly, if the hostname indicates a testing or pre-production environment (by containing "nft0", "sit0", "put0", "uat0" or substring "-dbp-"), additional flags are set; these include enabling pre-production features via `b.EnableCSPreprod`.

4. **Brand and Configuration Resolution:**
   - Sets the brand with priority for testing environments: If `b.EnableCSPreprod` is set, the brand key is temporarily overridden as "PreProd".
   - If the brand key (from `b.Brand`) does not exist in the mapping objects, it defaults to "Default".
   - Based on the resolved brand:
     - `window.CS_CONF` is configured with values that include the relevant project ID, domain endpoints (dependent on whether the infrastructure is Azure or AWS) and various tracking configurations.
     - `window.CS_INTEGRATIONS_CONF` is also populated, configuring integrations for platforms such as YouTube, Adobe Target, Qualtrics, etc.

### Dependencies on Global Objects or Libraries

- The extension relies on:
  - The `window` object for determining the current URL, hostname, and other global properties.
  - The `LBGAnalytics` object for feature flag settings.
  - It expects an object (`b` or eventPayload) to be passed from Tealium containing brand information and any other flags that might be used.
- No external libraries are directly imported; however, it implicitly depends on the environment provided by Tealium iQ.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Standard Production Environment

- **Input Context:**  
  - URL: https://www.lloydsbank.com/home  
  - `eventPayload.Brand`: "Lloyds"  
  - `LBGAnalytics.featureFlags.Contentsquare`: true  
- **Expected Behaviour:**  
  - The extension checks the pathname and hostnames, finds them valid for Contentsquare, and sets `b.EnableCS = true`.
  - It maps the brand "Lloyds" to project ID 5944 via `brandToProject` and uses the corresponding infrastructure from `brandToInfrastructure` ("AWS").
  - The configuration object `window.CS_CONF` is created with these domain endpoints and project settings.

### Scenario 2: URL Blocking Condition

- **Input Context:**  
  - URL: https://www.somebank.com/savingsidc/dashboard  
  - `eventPayload.Brand`: "SomeBrand" (or not set)  
- **Expected Behaviour:**  
  - Since the URL contains "savingsidc", the extension disables Contentsquare (`b.EnableCS = false`) immediately and exits the configuration process.

### Scenario 3: Testing / Pre-production Environment

- **Input Context:**  
  - URL: https://sit0.lloydsbank.com/home?enablecs  
  - `eventPayload.Brand`: "Lloyds"  
- **Expected Behaviour:**  
  - The hostname check detects pre-prod environment signatures.
  - The query string parameter enables Contentsquare related flags (`b.EnableCS`, `b.EnableCSNext`, `b.EnableCSPreprod`).
  - The brand is overridden to "PreProd", and the default project and infrastructure mappings for "PreProd" are applied.
  - The extension sets additional replay recording flag if configured.

### Scenario 4: Feature Flag Explicitly Disabled

- **Input Context:**  
  - URL: https://www.lloydsbank.com/home  
  - `LBGAnalytics.featureFlags.Contentsquare` is explicitly set to false  
- **Expected Behaviour:**  
  - The extension disables Contentsquare by setting `b.EnableCS` to undefined and does not proceed with configuring `window.CS_CONF`.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **URL Based Short-Circuit Logic:**  
  - The extension performs string searches in `window.location.pathname` and `window.location.hostname` without normalisation. Edge cases involving uppercase letters or unexpected path structures might not be handled consistently.
  
- **Silent Failures:**  
  - Any errors in the multiple try/catch blocks result in silent failures (empty catch blocks). While this prevents runtime errors from halting execution, it might make debugging more difficult if a section fails unexpectedly.

- **Dependency on Global Objects:**  
  - The reliance on `LBGAnalytics.featureFlags` and other global properties means that if these objects are not initialised or modified unexpectedly by other parts of the site, the extension might behave unpredictably.

- **Potential Conflicts:**  
  - If another Tealium extension or external script modifies similar global properties (e.g. `window.CS_CONF` or `LBGAnalytics.featureFlags`), conflicts may occur.
  - CSP (Content Security Policy) issues have already disabled certain checks for hostnames (e.g. the commented-out hostname for "planning.scottishwidows.co.uk", "www.cavendishonline.co.uk").

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Enhanced Logging:**  
  - Introduce logging within catch blocks (while maintaining simplicity for ES5) to provide insight when errors occur, to help with troubleshooting.
  
- **Modularisation:**  
  - Consider breaking the extension into smaller helper functions (e.g., one to validate URL conditions, another for configuration based on brand) to improve readability and maintainability.
  
- **Centralise Conditions:**  
  - Group similar conditions (e.g. hostname checks, query parameter checks) into dedicated functions to centralise logic and reduce repetition.
  
- **Defensive Checks:**  
  - While it is not necessary to check for the presence of `eventType` and `eventPayload`, adding explicit checks for global variable presence (beyond the current try/catch) could help ensure that external modifications do not cause unexpected behaviour.

- **Comments & Documentation:**  
  - Although inline comments exist, adding more context in code comments (or external documentation) about why specific hostnames or conditions were chosen can aid future developers.
  
- **Configuration Management:**  
  - Externalise configuration objects (e.g. `brandToProject` and `brandToInfrastructure`) into a central configuration file or object to simplify updates in the future.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  - Regularly verify that the hostname and URL conditions still reflect current production and test environments.
  - Monitor any changes to the global objects (like `LBGAnalytics.featureFlags`) on the site to ensure compatibility.

- **Ownership:**  
  - Assign clear ownership of this extension documentation to an analytics or integration team member responsible for Contentsquare and Tealium iQ integrations.

- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Include automated tests or manual test cases to simulate different URL paths, hostname variations, and feature flag settings.
  - Validate that changes to the brand configuration mappings are reflected accurately in the generated `window.CS_CONF`.

- **Change Management:**  
  - Since the extension configuration is critical to enabling analytics, any code changes should be thoroughly tested in a pre-production environment before being deployed live.
  - Keep a change log for adjustments to configuration mappings and hostname conditions.
