# Analytics CNAME Switch Extension Documentation

This document provides comprehensive details on the Analytics CNAME Switch extension for Tealium iQ, explaining its functionality, code logic, usage scenarios, known limitations, recommendations for future improvements, and maintenance guidelines.

---

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Analytics CNAME Switch  
- **ID:** 1666  
- **Extension ID:** 100036  
- **Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** 928  
- **Execution Frequency:** Typically executed on every relevant tag invocation (e.g. during page loads or specific events where the extension is triggered)

**Summary:**  
The Analytics CNAME Switch extension conditionally sets the tracking server for analytics calls by updating the global analytics object (namely `s.trackingServer` and `s.trackingServerSecure`) to a predefined CNAME:  
"analytics.data.lloydsbankinggroup.com". It also appends a “CNAME” indicator into the `TaggingMechanics` property of the provided tag object (`b`). The extension is designed to apply this change when certain conditions based on feature flags, hostname, and system indicators are met, ensuring that analytics calls are routed through the correct server setup.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables and Functions

- **enableCNAME Function:**  
  - Declared as an inner function that performs the following tasks:
    - Updates the analytics tracking server values (`s.trackingServerSecure` and `s.trackingServer`) to the static CNAME value.
    - Processes the current value of `b.TaggingMechanics` (expected to be a comma-separated string), splits it into an array, appends the "CNAME" marker, and then reassigns the updated string back to the property.
    
- **Global Dependencies:**  
  - `s`: The global analytics object expected to be pre-defined outside the extension code, whose properties are updated by this extension.
  - `b`: Represents the tag object (or similar object) containing properties such as `TaggingMechanics`.
  - `LBGAnalytics`: A global object that holds feature flags (e.g. `analyticsCNAME`) which control whether the CNAME override is applied.
  - `utag_data`: A globally available data layer object that provides system context (e.g. `System` property).
  - `window.location`: Used to verify the current hostname and pathname to decide if the extension should trigger the CNAME change.

### Logic Flow

1. **Function Definition:**  
   The `enableCNAME` function is declared to perform the server change and tagging mechanism update.

2. **Feature Flag Check:**  
   - The code first initialises `LBGAnalytics.featureFlags` if not already set.
   - It then checks if the `analyticsCNAME` feature flag is true. If so, it calls `enableCNAME`.

3. **Conditional Invocation Based on Location and System:**  
   - If the `window.location.hostname` is `"www.lloydsbank.com"` and `utag_data.System` equals `"SCEP"`, the function is triggered.
   - Similarly, for `window.location.hostname` `"secure.lloydsbank.co.uk"`, if the URL's path contains `".jsp"`, `enableCNAME` is called.
   - Another scenario applies when the hostname equals `"www.halifax.co.uk"` and `utag_data.System` is `"SCEP"`.

4. **Global Object Updates:**  
   - Once invoked, `enableCNAME` updates the analytics server settings and augments the `TaggingMechanics` property.

### Dependencies on Global Objects

- The extension relies on the existence and structure of several global objects:
  - `s`: It must have mutable properties `trackingServer` and `trackingServerSecure`.
  - `LBGAnalytics`: Must exist for the feature flag check.
  - `utag_data`: Should contain the `System` property for conditional logic.
  - `window.location`: Used to ascertain the current execution context based on hostname and pathname.
  - `b`: The tag object passed to the function must have a `TaggingMechanics` property for the extension to append the "CNAME" marker.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Feature Flag Enabled

- **Input Condition:**  
  - `LBGAnalytics.featureFlags.analyticsCNAME` is set to true.
- **Behaviour:**  
  - The `enableCNAME` function is called.
  - The analytics server properties (`s.trackingServerSecure` and `s.trackingServer`) are set to `"analytics.data.lloydsbankinggroup.com"`.
  - `"CNAME"` is appended to the `TaggingMechanics` property of the tag object.

### Scenario 2: Specific Hostname and System Match

- **Input Condition:**  
  - The current URL belongs to `"www.lloydsbank.com"` and `utag_data.System` equals `"SCEP"`.
- **Behaviour:**  
  - Despite the feature flag condition, the extension again invokes `enableCNAME` due to the match, thereby updating the server settings as needed.

### Scenario 3: Edge Condition with Secure Host and JSP Path

- **Input Condition:**  
  - The URL hostname is `"secure.lloydsbank.co.uk"` and the pathname contains `".jsp"`.
- **Behaviour:**  
  - The function `enableCNAME` is triggered, ensuring that the CNAME override is applied even if the system flag isn’t explicitly present.

### Scenario 4: Halifax System Check

- **Input Condition:**  
  - The current hostname is `"www.halifax.co.uk"` and the `utag_data.System` equals `"SCEP"`.
- **Behaviour:**  
  - The extension updates the tracking server and tagging mechanics accordingly.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Multiple Invocations:**  
  - Under scenarios where more than one conditional check passes, `enableCNAME` could be invoked multiple times. This may result in "CNAME" being appended repeatedly to the `TaggingMechanics` property.
  
- **Assumption of Global Object Availability:**  
  - The code assumes that global objects (`s`, `utag_data`, `LBGAnalytics`, etc.) are present and correctly initialised. Any inconsistency in these may lead to runtime errors.
  
- **TaggingMechanics Format:**  
  - The extension presumes that `b.TaggingMechanics` exists as a comma-separated string. If the value is of an unexpected type, the concatenation logic might fail.
  
- **Potential Conflicts:**  
  - There is a risk of conflicts with other Tealium extensions or external scripts that modify the same global objects (`s` or `b.TaggingMechanics`). Coordination is required to ensure mutual exclusivity or proper sequencing.
  
- **Hard-Coded Values:**  
  - The CNAME value ("analytics.data.lloydsbankinggroup.com") is hard-coded, reducing flexibility if changes are needed across different environments.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Prevent Duplicate Entries:**  
  - Introduce logic to check for the existence of "CNAME" in the `TaggingMechanics` array before pushing it, to avoid duplicate entries upon multiple invocations.

- **Modularise the enableCNAME Function:**  
  - Consider extracting the enableCNAME functionality into a separate utility file or namespace if it will be reused across multiple extensions while keeping within ES5 constraints.

- **Defensive Checks for Dependent Properties:**  
  - Although the availability of `eventType` and `eventPayload` is guaranteed, add defensive checks or logging for less certain globals such as `s`, `utag_data`, and `LBGAnalytics` to facilitate debugging if issues arise.

- **Add In-line Comments:**  
  - More detailed in-line comments can be added to explain the purpose of each conditional check, which can be beneficial during debugging or for new team members.

- **Code Style and Consistency:**  
  - Ensure consistent formatting (indentation, spacing) throughout the code. This improves readability and maintainability, especially in environments that do not support ES2015/ES6 syntax.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  - Keep documentation up to date with any changes to the hostname logic or server address.
  - Regularly review dependencies on global objects to ensure they match the current environment and data layer structure.
  
- **Ownership:**  
  - Assign a dedicated team or developer responsible for overseeing analytics configuration in Tealium, including testing and verifying the functionality of this extension.
  
- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Develop unit tests and integration tests for scenarios where the CNAME switch should be triggered.
  - Test the extension in multiple environments (e.g. production, staging) to ensure consistency in applying analytics settings.
  
- **Logging and Debugging:**  
  - Consider adding temporary logging statements during troubleshooting to record when and how `enableCNAME` is invoked. These logs can help diagnose issues in conditions or if unexpected behaviour is observed.

- **Version Control:**  
  - Maintain version changes in the documentation and code repository to track adjustments, especially those affecting global dependencies or conditional logic.
