# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name**: Canonical Path Override for CWAs
- **ID**: 100036
- **Type**: JavaScript Code
- **Scope**: After Load Rules
- **Execution Frequency**: Run Always

### Summary
This extension is designed to dynamically generate and override the canonical path for Certain Web Applications (CWAs) based on the domain name from which the application is accessed. It ensures that the canonical paths reflect a structured format, enhancing SEO accuracy and improving how search engines index the pages.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- `qualifyingDomains`: An array that contains specific domain names that qualify for path overrides. Only requests from these domains will trigger the canonical path adjustment.

### Logic Flow
1. The function starts by checking if the current hostname exists in the `qualifyingDomains` array.
2. If the request is found in the array and the current `CanonicalPath` is set to the root ("/"), it proceeds to build a new `CanonicalPath`.
3. The new path is constructed by concatenating the `JourneyName` and `JourneyStepName` from the `eventPayload`.
4. Slashes and spaces are replaced with hyphens to ensure a clean, URL-friendly format.
5. The modified `CanonicalPath` is prefixed with "/_/" and assigned back to `b.CanonicalPath`.

### Dependencies
This extension depends on the global objects `window`, `eventType`, and `eventPayload`. The `eventPayload` object must contain `JourneyName` and `JourneyStepName`.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Conditions
- **Scenario**: A user navigates to the "calculator.lloydsbank.co.uk" domain.
  - **Input**: `CanonicalPath` is "/" and eventPayload has `JourneyName` = "Home Loan" and `JourneyStepName` = "Application".
  - **Output**: Canonical Path is set to `"/_/home-loan/application"`.

### Edge Conditions
- **Scenario**: A user navigates to a non-qualifying domain.
  - **Input**: `window.location.hostname` = "example.com".
  - **Output**: The `CanonicalPath` remains unchanged as it is not modified.

- **Scenario**: The `CanonicalPath` is not the root path.
  - **Input**: `CanonicalPath` is already set to "/some-path".
  - **Output**: No changes are made, the existing path is retained.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- The extension only operates correctly under certain domains as defined in `qualifyingDomains`. Any other domains will not benefit from this functionality.
- If the necessary properties `JourneyName` or `JourneyStepName` are missing from the `eventPayload`, the resultant `CanonicalPath` will not be constructed properly, resulting in it potentially reverting to the default value.
- Conflicts may arise if other extensions or scripts manipulate the `CanonicalPath` variable after this extension runs, particularly if they do not take into account the necessary conditions for path construction.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks**: Although the availability of `eventType` and `eventPayload` is guaranteed, it is good practice to add checks for the existence of `JourneyName` and `JourneyStepName` for robustness.
- **Code Style**: Consider using descriptive variable names instead of single-letter ones (e.g., use `domain` instead of `a`), which would enhance readability.
- **Modularization**: Break out the logic for building the `CanonicalPath` into its own function. This approach allows for easier testing and refinement of that logic independent of the main routine.
  
```javascript
function buildCanonicalPath(journeyName, journeyStepName) {
    return "/_/" + [journeyName, journeyStepName]
        .filter(function(step) { return !!step; })
        .map(function(step) { return step.toLowerCase().replace(/ /g, "-"); })
        .join("/");
}

// Usage within the main function
b.CanonicalPath = buildCanonicalPath(b.JourneyName, b.JourneyStepName);
```

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ownership**: The team responsible for the maintenance of this extension should regularly review and update the qualifying domains in line with any changes in website structure or branding.
- **Testing Guidelines**: Before deploying any changes to this extension, a set of test cases should be defined to ensure that the outputs are as expected. Testing across all qualifying domains and under various conditions should be executed to prevent unexpected behaviour in live environments.
- **Documentation Review**: Periodic reviews of this documentation should be conducted to ensure that it remains aligned with the current implementation of the extension and general best practices in web development and SEO.
