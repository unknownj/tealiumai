# Canonical Path Override for CWAs Documentation

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Canonical Path Override for CWAs  
- **Extension ID:** 100036 (Internal ID: 1667)  
- **Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** After Load Rules  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Always  

### Summary

This extension intercepts the event payload and overrides the CanonicalPath property if the following conditions are met:  
- The current page’s hostname matches one of the predefined qualifying domains (with a current limitation in the implementation, see Known Limitations).  
- The existing CanonicalPath is simply the root ("/").

When both conditions are true, the extension constructs a new canonical path by combining the JourneyName and JourneyStepName properties. The new path is formatted in lower-case, with spaces replaced by hyphens, and is prefixed with “/_/”. This ensures that analytics or tag logic referencing CanonicalPath receive a standardised and meaningful URL fragment.

---

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables

- **qualifyingDomains:**  
  An array of strings that lists the specific hostnames (domains) for which the canonical path override should apply. Examples include “calculator.lloydsbank.co.uk”, “mortgages.halifax.co.uk”, etc.

- **eventType (parameter a):**  
  Although not directly used in the code, this parameter is part of the function signature and is guaranteed to be available.

- **eventPayload (parameter b):**  
  The object that contains various properties such as CanonicalPath, JourneyName, and JourneyStepName. This object is modified directly by the extension.

### Logic Flow

1. **Domain Qualification Check:**  
   The code compares the current window’s hostname (via `window.location.hostname`) against the values within the `qualifyingDomains` array.  
   NOTE: The condition uses `qualifyingDomains.indexOf(window.location.hostname) === 0` which means that only if the current hostname is at index 0 of the array (i.e. the first element) will the code inside the conditional execute. This may be a mistake if the intent is to allow any domain in the array to qualify.

2. **CanonicalPath Check:**  
   The code confirms that the CanonicalPath property in the event payload is exactly “/”. This ensures that the override only happens when the default or root path is provided.

3. **Modification of CanonicalPath:**  
   - The extension creates a new array using the properties `JourneyName` and `JourneyStepName` from the event payload.
   - The array is processed using:
     - A filter method that removes any empty or falsy values.
     - A map function that converts each truthy value to a string, transforms it to lower-case, and replaces spaces with hyphens.
   - The resulting array is then joined into a string with “/” as a separator and prefixed with “/_/” to form the new CanonicalPath.
   - The modified CanonicalPath is then assigned back into the event payload.

### Dependencies

- **Global Objects:**  
  The code depends on the `window` global object (specifically `window.location.hostname`).
  
- **Assumed Properties in Event Payload:**  
  The event payload (parameter `b`) is expected to include the following properties:
  - `CanonicalPath` – string (initially expected to be “/”)
  - `JourneyName` – string (used in forming the new path)
  - `JourneyStepName` – string (used in forming the new path)

- **No External Libraries:**  
  All methods used (e.g. `indexOf`, `filter`, `map`, `join`) are standard built-in methods available in ES5.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Example 1: Standard Scenario

**Input Conditions:**  
- Page hostname: "calculator.lloydsbank.co.uk"  
- eventPayload.CanonicalPath: "/"  
- eventPayload.JourneyName: "Personal Loan"  
- eventPayload.JourneyStepName: "Application Process"

**Processing:**  
- The hostname matches the first domain in the `qualifyingDomains` array.
- Because CanonicalPath is “/”, the code overrides it.
- The new CanonicalPath is constructed as follows:
  - Array created: ["Personal Loan", "Application Process"]
  - After filtering: ["Personal Loan", "Application Process"] (no falsy values)
  - After mapping: ["personal-loan", "application-process"]
  - Joined and prefixed: "/_/personal-loan/application-process"

**Outcome:**  
The eventPayload now contains:
- CanonicalPath: "/_/personal-loan/application-process"

---

### Example 2: Edge Case - Non-Root CanonicalPath

**Input Conditions:**  
- Page hostname: "calculator.lloydsbank.co.uk"  
- eventPayload.CanonicalPath: "/existing-path"  
- eventPayload.JourneyName: "Mortgage"  
- eventPayload.JourneyStepName: "Application"

**Processing:**  
- Although the hostname might be eligible, the CanonicalPath is not “/” (it is already defined).
- The conditional fails and the code does not modify the CanonicalPath.

**Outcome:**  
CanonicalPath remains as "/existing-path".

---

### Example 3: Edge Case - Non-Qualifying Domain

**Input Conditions:**  
- Page hostname: "example.com"  
- eventPayload.CanonicalPath: "/"  
- eventPayload.JourneyName: "Insurance"  
- eventPayload.JourneyStepName: "Quote"

**Processing:**  
- The current hostname does not match any entry (or does not match as the first element based on the intended index check).
- The extension will not override CanonicalPath.

**Outcome:**  
CanonicalPath remains as "/".

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Domain Qualification Logic:**  
  The check uses `qualifyingDomains.indexOf(window.location.hostname) === 0`, meaning that only if the hostname is positioned at index 0 ("calculator.lloydsbank.co.uk") in the array will the code execute. This may be unintentional if all domains in the array are intended to qualify. A typical check might use `indexOf(...) > -1`.

- **Empty Journey Values:**  
  If either `JourneyName` or `JourneyStepName` is missing or empty, the filtering step removes falsy values. This may lead to a canonical path with missing segments, potentially resulting in just “/_/” if both values are absent.

- **Order of Execution:**  
  Since the extension runs after load rules, any other extension modifying `CanonicalPath` beforehand (or even after) may conflict with this logic. It is important to coordinate with other extensions to ensure proper data flow.

- **Hardcoded Values:**  
  The list of qualifying domains is hardcoded. Any changes to domains require an update to the extension configuration.

---

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Qualifying Domain Check Update:**  
  Instead of checking for strict equality to 0, use a condition that checks if the current hostname exists within the list. For example:  

  (ES5-compliant version)  
  Code snippet suggestion:  
  …  
  if (qualifyingDomains.indexOf(window.location.hostname) > -1 && b.CanonicalPath === "/") {  
    // continue processing  
  }  
  …  

- **Improved Variable Naming:**  
  Rename function parameters and internal variables (e.g. "a", "b") to more descriptive names such as eventType and eventPayload for clarity and future maintainability.

- **Commenting and Documentation in Code:**  
  Consider adding inline comments to explain each block of logic. This will help future developers quickly understand the purpose of each code segment.

- **Modularisation:**  
  If more processing is likely in the future, consider separating the canonical path generation into a dedicated helper function. This would make unit testing easier and improve the code organisation.

- **Test Coverage:**  
  Write tests to cover scenarios when either JourneyName or JourneyStepName is missing, and when the CanonicalPath is not “/”, to ensure predictable behaviour.

- **Defensive Coding:**  
  Although the availability of `eventType` (string) and `eventPayload` (object) is guaranteed by requirements, consider verifying the existence and type of other critical properties (`CanonicalPath`, `JourneyName`, `JourneyStepName`) if future changes might not guarantee their presence.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  - Keep the list of qualifying domains updated in consultation with stakeholders from operations or web development teams.  
  - Regularly review the extension in case of website domain changes or new requirements within the journey analytics.

- **Ownership and Versioning:**  
  - Clearly document version changes in a changelog.  
  - Assign a maintainer (or team) responsible for this extension if changes in business logic or technical requirements occur.

- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Test the extension on each qualifying domain to ensure that the canonical path is correctly overridden only when expected.  
  - Validate that non-qualifying domains or non-root `CanonicalPath` values remain unaffected.  
  - Use staging environments for updates before deploying to production.

- **Coordination with Other Extensions:**  
  - If additional extensions interact with the CanonicalPath, make sure they are executed in the appropriate order.  
  - Regularly review the overall Tealium iQ configuration to avoid conflicts.

- **Documentation Updates:**  
  - Update this documentation page whenever the extension logic is modified or when a significant bug fix is implemented.
