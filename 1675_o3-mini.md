# ContentSquare Adobe Analytics Integration Extension

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** ContentSquare Adobe Analytics Integration  
- **Extension ID:** 100036  
- **Instance ID:** 1675  
- **Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** 928  
- **Execution Frequency:**  
  - The code runs at every page view (via "afterPageView" callback)  
  - Additionally, cookie-based tracking operations happen if specific conditions are met during the page’s lifecycle  

### Summary

This extension integrates ContentSquare with Adobe Analytics by:
- Pushing an "Adobe Analytics" integration flag into the global ContentSquare configuration.
- Setting a short-lived cookie (30 minutes) containing a matching key used to correlate ContentSquare visitor identification with Adobe Analytics.
- Capturing dynamic variables (namely, the CS matching key and an optional OCISID) to track visitor behaviour over time.
- Leveraging Tealium’s built-in global `_uxa` array and pushing tracking events after the page view.

The main aim of this extension is to ensure that data necessary for Adobe Analytics integration is set up and available for ContentSquare-based analytics, facilitating cross-platform tracking on a web page.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables and Global Objects

- **window._uxa:**  
  - A global array used to collect commands for tracking events. This array is appended with functions and configuration objects to be processed later by ContentSquare.

- **u, a, and b:**  
  - These parameters represent `tagObject` (u), `eventType` (a), and `eventPayload` (b) respectively.  
  - Although only `u` and `b` are actively used here, they provide the necessary context for the extension code.

- **CS_CONF:**  
  - Expected to be a global configuration object for ContentSquare.
  - Code pushes an integration string ("Adobe Analytics") into `CS_CONF.integrations`.

- **CookiesTargeting and CookiesPerformance:**  
  - Properties of the `eventPayload` object (`b`) that, when present, indicate that cookie-based operations are permitted.

- **cookieName:**  
  - A string literal `"_cs_mk_aa"`, representing the cookie used to store the ContentSquare matching key.

- **ContentSquareMatchKey:**  
  - A property created on `b` that either reuses an existing matching key (`b["cp._cs_mk_aa"]`) or generates a new unique identifier using a combination of a random number and the current timestamp.

### Logic Flow

1. **Initialisation:**
   - The extension begins by ensuring that the global `_uxa` array exists. If not, it initialises `_uxa` as an empty array.

2. **After Page View Tracking:**
   - A callback function is pushed into `_uxa` with the event `"afterPageView"`.
   - Inside this function:
     - It first checks for an existing `csCallback` flag or the absence of `window.CS_CONF`. If either condition is true, it exits the function.
     - Otherwise, it ensures that `window.CS_CONF` has an `integrations` array and pushes `"Adobe Analytics"` into this array.
     - Finally, it sets `u.csCallback` to `true` to mark that the callback has executed.

3. **Cookie-based Matching Key Handling:**
   - The extension verifies that both `b.CookiesTargeting` and `b.CookiesPerformance` are present.
   - It sets a cookie named `"_cs_mk_aa"`:
     - The matching key is obtained from `b["cp._cs_mk_aa"]` or generated as a new value.
     - The cookie is given a 30-minute expiration and is set with path `/`, a domain based on `utag.cfg.domain`, and the flags `SameSite=None; Secure`.
   - It then pushes a dynamic variable into `_uxa` with the key `"csMatchingKey"`, storing the matching key value.

4. **Optional OCISID Tracking:**
   - If the property `OCISID` exists on `b`, it pushes another dynamic variable into `_uxa`:
     - The key is `"ocis-id"` with the corresponding value from `b.OCISID`.

### Dependencies

- **Global Objects:**  
  - `window._uxa`, `window.CS_CONF`, and `utag.cfg.domain` are used extensively.  
  - The availability of specific properties on the `eventPayload` (`b`) such as `CookiesTargeting`, `CookiesPerformance` and `OCISID` is assumed.

- **Tealium Environment:**  
  - The extension relies on Tealium’s tag management environment to provide `eventType`, `eventPayload`, and `tagObject` as well as a pre-defined `utag.cfg.domain`.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Operation

- **Scenario:**  
  - A user visits a page where the required conditions (availability of `CookiesTargeting` and `CookiesPerformance`) are met.
  - CS_CONF is present and has not been modified by another callback.
  - The extension executes successfully:
    - The "afterPageView" callback checks the conditions, adds "Adobe Analytics" to the `integrations` list, and sets `u.csCallback` to true.
    - Since cookie support is verified, it creates or reuses the matching key and sets the `"_cs_mk_aa"` cookie.
    - The dynamic variable `"csMatchingKey"` is pushed into the `_uxa` array.
    - If `OCISID` is provided, an additional dynamic variable is pushed.

### Edge Conditions

- **Missing CS_CONF or Callback Already Executed:**
  - If `window.CS_CONF` is not defined or `u.csCallback` is already set, the "afterPageView" callback returns immediately without doing its work.
  
- **Cookie Conditions Not Met:**
  - If either `b.CookiesTargeting` or `b.CookiesPerformance` is not present, the cookie creation block is skipped.
  - Consequently, no matching key is set nor is the `"csMatchingKey"` variable pushed to the `_uxa` array.

- **OCISID Not Available:**
  - The extension conditionally pushes the `"ocis-id"` dynamic variable only when `b.OCISID` exists.  
  - Absence of `OCISID` results in no action for this part of the script.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Global Dependencies:**  
  - The extension depends on global objects such as `window.CS_CONF`, `window._uxa`, and `utag.cfg.domain`. If these are not available or are modified elsewhere in the page, the extension’s behaviour might be unpredictable.
  
- **Cookie Domain Configuration:**  
  - The cookie is set with the domain prefix `"." + utag.cfg.domain`. If `utag.cfg.domain` is not defined or incorrectly configured, the cookie may not be set or could propagate incorrectly across subdomains.
  
- **Single Callback Execution:**  
  - The usage of `u.csCallback` as a flag prevents the "afterPageView" callback from running more than once. This may lead to missed updates if the page state changes unexpectedly.
  
- **Potential Conflicts:**  
  - If multiple extensions or scripts modify the same global arrays or properties (e.g. `_uxa` or `CS_CONF`), there may be conflicts leading to incorrect tracking or integration issues.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Modularisation:**  
  - Consider refactoring the code into smaller, modular functions to separate concerns. For example, create individual functions for cookie operations, CS_CONF updates, and dynamic variable tracking.
  
- **Improved Defensive Checks:**  
  - While the code assumes `eventType` and `eventPayload` are always available, additional checks can be implemented for global objects like `utag.cfg` and `window.CS_CONF` to avoid runtime errors.
  
- **Consistency in Global Access:**  
  - Consolidate access to global variables like `utag.cfg.domain` by encapsulating them in a helper function. This can simplify error handling if the domain is misconfigured.
  
- **Optimised Callback Handling:**  
  - Instead of using a generic flag (`u.csCallback`), consider using a more descriptive property name (e.g. `u.csAdobeAnalyticsIntegrated`) to improve clarity for future maintainers.
  
- **Code Comments and Documentation:**  
  - Increase inline documentation within the code to explain why certain checks are made (e.g. why both `CookiesTargeting` and `CookiesPerformance` are required) to aid future debugging and maintenace.

_Note: Ensure that any refactoring adheres strictly to ES5 standards to maintain compatibility with the current environment._

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Testing:**  
  - Regular testing across different browsers and in various deployment scenarios should be conducted to ensure cookie and tracking behaviour remains consistent.
  - Automated tests should be considered that simulate the presence/absence of expected global variables and eventPayload properties.
  
- **Ownership and Updates:**  
  - Identify a designated owner or team responsible for this integration. This helps in managing feature updates, refactoring, and handling any issues or conflicts related to the integration.
  
- **Change Management:**  
  - Maintain a change log for the extension updates. Record details about bug fixes, refactoring, and new feature incorporations.
  
- **Cross-team Coordination:**  
  - Coordinate with teams responsible for other Tealium extensions and external tracking systems (e.g. ContentSquare, Adobe Analytics) to monitor potential conflicts and integration issues.
  
- **Documentation Reviews:**  
  - Schedule regular reviews of both code and documentation to identify any necessary updates or to deprecate obsolete functionality, ensuring the integration remains robust and up to date with evolving business requirements.
