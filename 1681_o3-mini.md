# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation

This document details the "Extension Handler 2022" extension. It covers an overview, a step-by-step explanation of the code logic, sample usage scenarios, known limitations, suggestions for refactoring, and maintenance guidelines.

---

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Extension Handler 2022  
- **ID:** 1681 (extension configuration)  
- **Type:** Advanced Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** Pre Loader  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Once

**Summary:**  
The extension serves as a central handler for registering and executing multiple sub-extensions. It is responsible for managing an internal list of extensions, filtering them by scope, enforcing execution limits, and capturing logs/history for each run. The purpose is to provide a standardised mechanism for extensions to manipulate event payloads and perform custom logic in a controlled environment.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables and Functions

- **Global Namespace:**  
  The extension attaches itself to the global object `LBGAnalytics` by adding an `extensions` property. The code assumes that `window.LBGAnalytics` and some of its sub-properties (e.g. `$` as a jQuery reference, `datalayer`) are available.

- **extensionList (Array):**  
  Holds all registered extensions that are enabled and in scope. Each extension is an object prepared against a defined schema.

- **log (Function):**  
  A self-contained logging function that caches messages internally.  
  - When invoked, a log entry is pushed into the cache.  
  - Contains a nested `flush` method that clears and returns the current cache, ensuring that logs can be tied to individual extension executions.

- **push (Function):**  
  Used to add an extension to the `extensionList`. It validates that:  
  - The extension is an object.
  - It is marked as enabled.
  - It is in scope for execution.  
  Upon registration, runtime metadata (such as `runcount` and `history`) is initialised.

- **run (Function):**  
  Main execution handler that:  
  - Accepts an `eventType` (e.g. "view", "link"), a `payload` object, and a specified `scope`.  
  - Filters the registered extensions based on if their scope matches the provided scope (using an index check).  
  - Iterates through each qualifying extension:
    - Verifies if the extension has reached its execution run limit.
    - Clears any residual logs using `log.flush()` before processing.
    - Determines the payload for the extension code:
      - If input variables are constrained (via `inputs`), only those items are merged into `runPayload`.
      - Otherwise, a complete shallow copy of the payload is performed.
    - Executes the extension's `code` function with the following parameters:
      1. Event Type
      2. The prepared payload (`runPayload`)
      3. The logging function (`log`)
      4. jQuery reference (`window.LBGAnalytics.$`)
      5. Datalayer reference (`window.LBGAnalytics.datalayer`)
      6. Full `LBGAnalytics` reference
      7. Tealium (`utag`), or an empty object if not present
      8. A custom console-like object (with log, info, and error methods mapping to `log`)
      9. The `window` object
    - If the extension specifies output variables (via `outputs`), it updates only those keys back into the original payload.
    - On success, the extension’s history is updated with details such as the runId, outcome, a timestamp, and logs collected during execution.
  - If an exception is thrown during execution, the error is caught, logged, and a similar history record is created.

### Logic Flow Summary

1. **Registration:**  
   Extensions are added via the `push` method, but only if they are enabled and in scope. This registration ensures each extension receives initialized runtime counters (`runcount` and `history`).

2. **Execution:**  
   When a run is triggered with a specific event type and payload:
   - The code filters for extensions matching the provided scope.
   - For each extension:
     - It enforces a run limit if one has been defined.
     - Prepares a temporary payload (optionally limited by defined input keys).
     - Executes the extension code and captures any output.
     - Merges updated values back into the original payload if necessary.
     - Captures logs and the outcome in the extension’s history.
   - Any execution errors are trapped and documented in the history with a timestamp.

### Dependencies on Global Objects/Libraries

- **window.LBGAnalytics:**  
  The extension relies heavily on the existence of this object, including sub-properties such as:
  - `$.` (presumably a jQuery instance)
  - `datalayer`
  - It is also passed as a reference into each extension run.

- **window.utag:**  
  Provided by Tealium, though a fallback empty object is used if it is not available.

- **console:**  
  The extension uses a custom console-like object that redirects log calls to the extension’s logging mechanism.

- **Standard ES5 Methods:**  
  The extension utilises ES5 methods like `forEach` and `reduce` to manipulate arrays and objects.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Operation Scenario

1. **Registration and Running an Extension:**

   - A developer creates an extension object with properties such as `name`, `scope`, `inputs`, `outputs`, a `runlimit`, and a `code` function.  
   - The extension is pushed into the `LBGAnalytics.extensions.extensionList` via the `push` method.  
   - When an event (e.g. a "view" event) is triggered, the `run` method is called with:
     - `eventType`: "view"
     - `payload`: An object containing data such as { pageTitle: "Home", userType: "Member" }
     - `scope`: "Pre Loader"
   - The extension is executed, and if it uses a subset of payload variables (via the `inputs` property), then only those are available to its logic.
   - When the extension completes, if there is any modification to the payload (and if `outputs` are defined), only the designated keys are merged back into the original payload.
   - The extension logs its execution process and updates its history with outcome and logs.

2. **Extension with Run Limit:**

   - If an extension has a defined `runlimit` (e.g. 3), and it has already been executed that many times, then subsequent invocations will log that the run limit has been reached and will not execute the code again.

### Edge Cases Scenario

1. **Missing Input Variables:**

   - If an extension defines inputs that are not part of the payload, the reduced payload (`runPayload`) will have keys with undefined values.
   - The extension’s code should handle such cases gracefully to prevent runtime errors.

2. **Errors During Execution:**

   - If an exception occurs inside an extension’s `code` function (for example, due to a logic error or missing property), the error is caught.  
   - The error message is logged using the `log` function and recorded in the extension’s history with the error object as the outcome.
   - This ensures that one extension’s failure does not impact the execution of others.

3. **Restricted Output Updates:**

   - When an extension specifies an `outputs` array, only the variables listed are updated back into the main payload.  
   - Any changes made to other properties within the temporary payload `runPayload` are ignored, ensuring controlled data updates.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Global Dependencies:**  
  The successful execution of the extension depends on the presence of `window.LBGAnalytics` and possibly `window.LBGAnalytics.$`. If these objects are not available or have been modified by other scripts, it may cause failures.

- **Scope Filtering:**  
  The filtering for extensions uses a simple `indexOf()` method on the `scope` property which assumes it is a string containing the target scope. If `scope` is an array, this may lead to unexpected results.

- **Potential Overwrites on Payload:**  
  The merging back of the payload is done by iterating through keys. If two extensions modify the same key value, later runs may overwrite changes from previous ones.

- **Error Handling:**  
  Errors caught during extension execution store only the error message (`err.message`) and may lose more detailed information (e.g. stack trace) which could be useful for debugging in complex scenarios.

- **Legacy Code Comments:**  
  There is a commented-out block of code ("old code") that hints there was an alternative strategy for merging payload data. This may indicate an area that was not fully refactored.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Improved Validation:**  
  Consider adding checks to ensure that the expected global objects (e.g. `window.LBGAnalytics`, `window.utag`) exist before processing. This minimizes potential runtime errors from undefined references.

- **Modularise Code:**  
  Split the payload preparation, log handling, and history updates into separate helper functions. This will improve readability and testability.

- **Enhanced Error Handling:**  
  Record more comprehensive error information (such as the entire error object or a stack trace) in the history records. This could aid debugging.

- **Scope Evaluation:**  
  Clearly define the expected type of the `scope` property (string versus array) and adjust the filtering method accordingly.  
  For example, if multiple scopes are supported, iterate over an array to find a match rather than relying solely on `indexOf`.

- **Consistent Coding Style:**  
  Although the code currently supports ES5, standardising function declarations and using descriptive variable names can improve long-term maintainability.

- **Log Management:**  
  Consider abstracting the log flushing mechanism so that logs from one extension do not inadvertently bleed into another’s context. A more advanced log tracking system with unique identifiers per run might be beneficial.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Testing:**  
  Implement unit tests for each public function (e.g. `push` and `run`). This ensures that future changes do not break existing functionality or change expected behaviours.
  
- **Version Control and Documentation:**  
  Maintain versioning for the extension code and document any changes. This includes updating this documentation when new features or bug fixes are introduced.

- **Ownership:**  
  Clearly identify the team or individual responsible for the extension’s maintenance. This ensures there is accountability for code improvements and troubleshooting.

- **Performance Monitoring:**  
  Monitor the performance impact of running multiple extensions, especially in environments with high event throughput. Ensure that the logging and history accumulation mechanism does not cause memory overhead over prolonged periods.

- **Interaction with Other Extensions:**  
  Be aware of potential conflicts with other Tealium extensions that might manipulate the same payload or rely on similar global objects. Regular audits of the extension order and dependencies can mitigate such issues.

- **Documentation Updates:**  
  Encourage contributions to this documentation when changes are made in the code. A living document is critical to ensure all stakeholders are informed of current behaviours and any caveats.
