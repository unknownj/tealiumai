# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation – Extension Population 2022

This documentation covers the inner workings and purpose of the Advanced Javascript Code extension (Extension Population 2022). The extension registers a series of functions on the global LBGAnalytics.extensions object to implement tracking, event handling, cookie management, and various data layer manipulations. The code is executed in several different scopes (Pre Loader, DOM Ready, BLR, ALR, After Tags and Pre-Loaders) to meet business requirements across multiple brands and user journeys.

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Extension Population 2022  
- **Extension ID:** 100040  
- **Type:** Advanced Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** Primarily Pre Loader, with portions in DOM Ready, BLR (Brand Level Reporting), ALR (After Loader Reporting) and After Tags  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Once (per the metadata comment, although some individual functions have a separate runlimit)

**Summary:**  
This extension aggregates multiple discrete sub-extensions. Each sub-extension is pushed into the LBGAnalytics.extensions array and targets various data layer tasks:
- Injecting UTAG data layer elements and environment variables.
- Adding social share click event handlers.
- Overriding favicons.
- Tracking video progress percentages.
- Processing advanced analytics improvements (e.g. lead clicks and persistence library).
- Managing fudge processing to normalise journey data fields.
- Handling deferred tag execution as well as cookie stitching and webview detection.
- Overriding UTM parameters for specific campaigns.  
The rationale behind this approach is to centralise multiple tracking and data manipulation routines needed for different journey scenarios and brands, thereby allowing for granular control and consistency.

## 2. Code Explanation

### General Structure and Flow
- **Global Injection:**  
  The code first registers with the global object `LBGAnalytics` by pushing sub-extension objects into the `LBGAnalytics.extensions` array. Each sub-extension is defined with properties including:
  - `name`: A descriptive name (e.g. "utag datalayer elements", "1676: c-128 Social Share Events")
  - `scope`: Specifies when it should run (e.g. "domready.alr", "global.blr", "preload.alr", etc.)
  - `runlimit`: Defines how many times the code should run (either a count or void 0 for continuous monitoring)  
  - `enabled` and `inscope`: Boolean flags indicating if the extension is active and should be executed on the required scope.
  - `code`: A function where all the logic is contained.

- **Error Handling:**  
  Each block is wrapped in a try-catch that logs any unhandled errors via `LBGAnalytics.extensions.log`. This allows the extension to fail gracefully without stopping the overall tag execution.

### Key Variables and Logic Flows

- **Global Dependencies:**
  - `LBGAnalytics`: The primary global object that collects all extension routines.
  - `utag`: Used in the UTAG-related sub-extension to extract and set data layer elements.
  - `document` and `window`: Used for DOM manipulation, cookie access, and performance timing.
  - `a` (alias for jQuery or a jQuery-like API): Supports DOM element selection and event binding.
  - `s` (typically representing a configuration or session object): Used to access asset properties (e.g. `s.location` or `s.cookies`).

- **Sub-extension Examples:**
  - **UTAG Data Layer Elements:**  
    The code inspects the configuration (`c.cfg`) and sets values on a data store (`i.set`) for keys prefixed with "utag." The extension also extracts an environment variable from a file path.
    
  - **Social Share Events:**  
    Searches for specific social widget CSS classes. If found, the code binds `.click()` event handlers to favourite social media buttons (e.g. Facebook, Twitter) and registers event triggers.
    
  - **Favicon Replacement:**  
    Checks whether the current favicon URL matches the expected path and, if not, replaces it with a Base64 encoded PNG string.
    
  - **Video Progress Tracking:**  
    A timer (using `setInterval`) fires every second to loop through video players. When the playback percentage (25, 50, 75%) is exceeded, it triggers events and updates correlations.
    
  - **Fudge Processor:**  
    Applies data “fudges” on various journey data points using lookup tables, criteria functions, and corrective actions. The processor iterates over a series of items that modify, normalise, or clear data fields based on business rules.
    
  - **Deferred Tags and Cookie Stitching (Pre-Loaders):**  
    These sections schedule tag deferral until the document is ready or set additional cookies. The code makes extensive use of timeout loops and event listeners (e.g. onLoad) to ensure proper sequence.

- **Data Flow:**  
  Each sub-extension is designed to either send data to analytics endpoints (`o.events.send`) after successful interaction (for social share and video events) or update the persistent state (using `a.persist.set`) and cookies to retain state between sessions.

## 3. Usage Examples

- **Normal Scenario (Page Load):**
  1. When the page loads (DOM Ready), the UTAG data layer elements extension runs to map utag configuration values to the data layer.
  2. Social share icons in the DOM are detected. Click event handlers are added so that when a user clicks on a Facebook share button, an event with payload `{EventAction:"Share", EventNarrative:"Facebook"}` is sent.
  3. If a video is embedded on the page, the video progress tracking sub-extension polls the player listing every second. Upon reaching 25%, 50%, or 75% completion of video playback, the appropriate tracking events are fired.

- **Edge Scenario (Missing Global Objects):**
  - If for example, the global `utag` object is missing or is malformed, the code in the UTAG extension will detect this, increment its run limit, and log a message (e.g. “No utag object”). The error is caught and processing continues for other sub-extensions.
  - If the required DOM element for a smart banner or social widget is not available, the code will return an instructive message such as “No banner found” or “No social widget class found”, so no further actions are attempted in that run.

- **Cross-Browser / Asynchronous Execution:**
  - The webview detection sub-extension can be triggered based on hostname checks and cookies. It performs multiple asynchronous tests with timeouts, ensuring that even if one test fails, others are evaluated, and debug logs are produced if thresholds are not met.

---

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Dependence on Global Objects:**  
  The extension heavily relies on the existence of `LBGAnalytics`, `utag`, and a jQuery-like DOM selector (`a` or similar) in the global space. If any of these objects are unavailable or overridden by other scripts, certain functions may not execute correctly.

- **Order of Execution:**  
  Extensions with overlapping scopes (e.g. DOM Ready vs Pre Loader) might have dependencies on each other’s output. Conflicts could occur if the order of execution is different than expected.

- **Sub-extension “Cannot Process” Comments:**  
  Many included files have a comment indicating “Cannot process …”. These segments are not included in the current code bundle, so any modifications or dependencies in those might be absent from production.

- **Browser Compatibility:**  
  As the code supports ES5 only, it uses standard var declarations and function expressions. However, reliance on certain methods (e.g. Array.filter, JSON.parse) may need polyfills in older browsers.

- **Asynchronous Race Conditions:**  
  Some sections (e.g. deferred tag execution and webview detection) use timeouts and interval polling. Under heavy load or slower connections, these asynchronous patterns might lead to race conditions or duplicate fire events.

- **Cookie and DOM Dependency:**  
  The cookie stitching and smart banner modules assume that the relevant DOM elements and cookie libraries are already in place. Any deviation in HTML structure or cookie handling could lead to incorrect behaviour.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Consolidate Common Logic:**  
  Several sub-extensions share similar patterns (e.g., error handling, use of runlimit, setting data into the analytics data layer). Consider creating helper functions to reduce code repetition and increase readability.

- **Improve Modularity:**  
  Break the large file into separate, more manageable files per functional area (e.g. social events, cookie management, fudge processor, deferred tags). Each file should encapsulate its functionality and export a common interface for registration with LBGAnalytics.

- **Defensive Error Handling:**  
  Although try-catch blocks are included, consider logging more contextual information (e.g. the element selector that failed) so that debugging in production is easier.

- **Comments & Code Style:**  
  Increase inline comments in critical sections to help future developers understand the decision logic (for example, explain the rationale behind particular fudge processor lookup values and criteria). Ensure that coding conventions are consistent (e.g. indentation, naming conventions).

- **Maintain ES5 Compliancy:**  
  Do not update to ES6 syntax (e.g. arrow functions, let/const, template literals) as the project requirement is to support ES5. Retain function expressions and var declarations for compatibility.

- **Logging Enhancements:**  
  Consider adding verbosity levels to `LBGAnalytics.extensions.log` to allow developers to switch on/off debug output during testing or in production.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ownership & Versioning:**  
  Clearly document which developer or team is responsible for each sub-extension. Use version control to maintain proper change history and allow for rollbacks if an update breaks functionality.

- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Create unit tests for individual sub-extension functions to ensure that input handling (correct and edge-case values) produces the expected outputs.
  - Test in a controlled environment across different browsers to ensure that DOM changes or cookie methods behave consistently.
  
- **Monitoring & Alerts:**  
  Implement monitoring of key metrics (such as error logs from LBGAnalytics.extensions.log) so that any anomalies in production can be immediately addressed.

- **Interdependency Checks:**  
  Document any dependencies between the sub-extensions to ensure that order of execution is not inadvertently changed. If possible, create a dependency diagram for stakeholders.

- **Documentation Updates:**  
  Update this documentation as new sub-extensions are added or removed, ensuring that stakeholders and developers remain informed about data layer changes and tracking logic.
