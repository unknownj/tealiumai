# Extension Documentation: Extension Execution 2022 - DOM Ready

This document provides a detailed overview and explanation of the Tealium iQ extension "Extension Execution 2022 - DOM Ready". It covers the extension metadata, code logic, usage scenarios, known limitations, refactoring recommendations and maintenance guidelines.

---

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Extension Execution 2022 - DOM Ready
- **ID:** 1685 (with extensionId: 100040)
- **Type:** Advanced Javascript Code
- **Scope:** DOM Ready
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Once

**Summary:**  
This Tealium iQ extension is designed to be executed when the DOM is fully loaded. It utilises the global analytics object (LBGAnalytics) to run a predefined extension identified by the string "domready.alr". The purpose is to ensure that specific analytics logic or event tracking is triggered at the precise moment the DOM is ready, possibly to capture page interactions or to perform initialisation routines that depend on the DOM structure.

    //   "conditions": [],
    //   "extensionId": 100040,
    //   "extensionType": "Advanced Javascript Code",
    //   "id": 1685,

    // }
    
    LBGAnalytics.extensions.run("dom", {},"domready.alr");

**Key Variables and Logic Flow:**

- **LBGAnalytics:**  
  This is the primary global object used to execute extensions. The extension depends on this object being available on the page.

- **extensions.run Method:**  
  The method `run` belonging to `LBGAnalytics.extensions` is called with three arguments:
  
  - **First Parameter ("dom"):**  
    Typically, this string signifies the event type or the domain of the event to be tracked. In this scenario, “dom” could be indicating that the event is related to the Document Object Model events.
  
  - **Second Parameter (Empty Object {}):**  
    This parameter is used as a placeholder for any potential data payload. In this instance, no specific data is being passed, thus an empty object is provided.
  
  - **Third Parameter ("domready.alr"):**  
    This is a unique identifier or key for the specific extension routine to be executed when the DOM is ready.

**Dependencies:**

- **Global Objects:**  
  The extension depends on the globally available `LBGAnalytics` object. Without this object being initialised, the call to `LBGAnalytics.extensions.run` will fail.

- **Tealium iQ Environment:**  
  The extension is designed to be run as part of a Tealium iQ deployment, where the extension metadata and configuration are handled prior to execution.

## 3. Usage Examples

**Normal Scenario:**

- **Page Load Event:**  
  When the page fully loads and the DOM is ready, Tealium iQ triggers the execution of DOM Ready scoped extensions. The code calls:
  
      LBGAnalytics.extensions.run("dom", {},"domready.alr");
  
  This initiates the analytics routine corresponding to "domready.alr". Since the data object is empty, the extension routine relies solely on the event type and the identifier to carry out its logic.

**Edge Conditions:**

- **Missing LBGAnalytics Global Object:**  
  If for any reason the global `LBGAnalytics` object is not initialised (e.g. due to script loading order issues), the method call will produce a runtime error.

- **Unexpected Data Payloads:**  
  Although in this case the extension always supplies an empty object, modifications or misconfigurations that pass an unexpected data payload structure could impact the expected behaviour of the associated extension (e.g. "domready.alr").

- **Conflicting DOM Ready Extensions:**  
  If multiple DOM Ready extensions manipulate the same data layer or rely on the same global state without proper namespacing, unpredictable results may occur.

---

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Reliance on Global Object:**  
  The extension assumes `LBGAnalytics` is correctly loaded and available. A failure in loading this object will stop the extension from executing.

- **Script Loading Order:**  
  The extension must be executed after `LBGAnalytics` has been defined and initialised. Ensure correct sequencing in the Tealium iQ configuration to avoid undefined errors.

- **Limited Payload Handling:**  
  The provided code calls the run method with an empty object. Any changes requiring data to be passed in future should verify the receiving function can handle such data.

- **Potential Conflicts:**  
  Extensions with similar scopes or execution conditions may interfere with each other if they share or modify common global properties or DOM elements. Ensure clear separation of logic across extensions.

---

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Verifying Global Object Availability:**  
  Although defensive coding for eventType (string) and eventPayload (object) is not required, consider adding a simple check to ensure the `LBGAnalytics` object is defined.  
  For example:

    if (typeof LBGAnalytics !== "undefined" && LBGAnalytics.extensions && typeof LBGAnalytics.extensions.run === "function") {
      LBGAnalytics.extensions.run("dom", {}, "domready.alr");
    }
  
  This is a purely defensive measure in ES5 syntax.

- **Modularisation:**  
  If further logic is to be added, consider isolating additional functionality in separate functions or files to maintain clarity. Keep the extension code focused on triggering the designated routine.

- **Clear Commenting:**  
  Enhance inline comments to describe the purpose of each parameter, especially if future developers might extend or modify the logic.

- **Consistent Coding Style:**  
  Maintain a consistent style within the code (e.g. use of spaces, semicolons, and commenting conventions) to improve readability and maintainability.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  - Review the loading order of scripts regularly during Tealium iQ deployments to ensure that `LBGAnalytics` is correctly initialised before the DOM Ready scoped extensions execute.
  - Monitor any updates to Tealium iQ or related libraries that might affect how global objects are handled or how extensions are executed.
  
- **Ownership & Testing:**  
  - Assign a team or individual responsible for maintaining the analytics configuration and ensure thorough testing is conducted whenever changes are made in the Tealium iQ dashboard.
  - Implement unit tests or integration tests during development to verify that the extension reliably triggers on DOM Ready and that no unintended side effects occur.

- **Documentation Updates:**  
  - Review and update this documentation on any changes made to the extension code or its configuration.
  - Maintain version control on the extension documentation, ensuring that all stakeholders are aware of changes or refactoring efforts.

- **Stakeholder Communication:**  
  - Share updates on the extension’s performance and any observed edge cases with relevant teams to foster a collaborative maintenance environment.
