# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation

This document provides a detailed explanation of the "Extension Execution 2022 - After Load Rules" Tealium iQ extension, including its purpose, implementation details, usage scenarios, limitations, and recommendations for future improvements. The code is written in ES5-compatible JavaScript.

---

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Extension Execution 2022 - After Load Rules  
- **ID:** 1686  
- **Type:** Advanced Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** After Load Rules  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Always

**Summary:**  
This extension is designed to execute custom analytics functions after load rules have been applied. It calls two separate runner functions:
- The first call is to `LBGAnalytics.extensions.run` passing the event type, event payload, and a string identifier ("global.alr").
- The second call is to `LBGAnalytics.santa.runRunners` using the string identifier ("alr") and the event payload.

This structure allows for flexible execution of analytics routines based on the detected event type and payload. It effectively bridges Tealium event handling with specific custom analytics routines defined externally.

---

## 2. Code Explanation

The extension code is wrapped in an immediately-invoked function expression (IIFE) to encapsulate its execution. Below is an explanation of the key parts:

```javascript
(function(a, b){
    try {
        LBGAnalytics.extensions.run(a, b, "global.alr");
    } catch(e) {
        // never mind
    }

    try {
        LBGAnalytics.santa.runRunners("alr", b);
    } catch(e) {
        // never mind
    }
})(eventType, eventPayload);
```

### Key Variables & Parameters

- **a:** Represents the `eventType` variable, a string indicating the type of event triggering the extension.
- **b:** Represents the `eventPayload`, an object containing additional data associated with the event.

### Logic Flow

1. **Initial Invocation:**  
   The IIFE is immediately executed with `eventType` and `eventPayload` as parameters.
   
2. **First try-catch Block:**  
   - The function attempts to execute `LBGAnalytics.extensions.run(a, b, "global.alr")`:
     - **Purpose:** This function call is responsible for invoking a global analytics routine (likely registered under "global.alr").
     - **Error Handling:** Any errors are silently caught using a `try-catch` block, ensuring that the extension does not halt further operations if this step fails.

3. **Second try-catch Block:**  
   - The function then attempts to execute `LBGAnalytics.santa.runRunners("alr", b)`:
     - **Purpose:** Similar to the first call, this executes another analytics runner function registered within the `santa` object using a different identifier ("alr").
     - **Error Handling:** Errors from this execution are also silently caught, following the same fail-safe approach.

### Dependencies & Global Objects

- **LBGAnalytics:**  
  - This global object is expected to contain two sub-objects:
    - **extensions:** Should have a method `run` that takes an event type, an event payload, and a string identifier.
    - **santa:** Should have a method `runRunners` which expects a string identifier and the event payload.
- Both functions are critical for the analytics processes initiated by this extension. Their presence and correct implementation in the global scope are assumed.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Example Scenario 1: Normal Operation

- **Situation:** A typical event occurs where `eventType` is `"click"` and `eventPayload` contains user interaction details.
  - **Flow:**  
    1. The IIFE is triggered with `("click", { buttonId: "submit", page: "signup" })`.
    2. The first try block calls `LBGAnalytics.extensions.run("click", { buttonId: "submit", page: "signup" }, "global.alr")`.
    3. The second try block calls `LBGAnalytics.santa.runRunners("alr", { buttonId: "submit", page: "signup" })`.
  - **Outcome:** Both analytics routines execute as expected.

### Example Scenario 2: Missing Analytics Functions

- **Situation:** The global object `LBGAnalytics` is either not defined or does not have the `extensions.run` and/or `santa.runRunners` methods.
  - **Flow:**  
    1. When the IIFE is executed, each call to the analytics functions will throw an error.
    2. These errors are caught by the respective try-catch blocks.
  - **Outcome:** The extension fails gracefully, with the errors being silently ignored. No further action or disruption is caused to the overall Tealium process.

### Example Scenario 3: Partial Implementation

- **Situation:** Only one of the required runner functions (for example, `LBGAnalytics.extensions.run`) is available, while `LBGAnalytics.santa.runRunners` is missing.
  - **Flow:**  
    1. The first try block executes successfully.
    2. The second try block throws an error due to the missing function but is caught and ignored.
  - **Outcome:** The available runner function processes the event, ensuring partial functionality.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Silent Failures:**  
  - The use of empty catch blocks means that errors are not logged. This can make debugging difficult if the analytics functions consistently fail.
  
- **Dependency on Global Objects:**  
  - The extension assumes that `LBGAnalytics` with its sub-objects (`extensions` and `santa`) exists in the global scope. If these objects are not initialised prior to the execution, none of the intended analytics routines will run.
  
- **No Feedback on Errors:**  
  - There is no error reporting mechanism in place. Even if important analytics functions are missing or malfunctioning, the extension does not provide any hint to potential issues.
  
- **Potential Conflicts:**  
  - Other Tealium extensions or external scripts that manipulate the same global objects (`LBGAnalytics`) might conflict with or override the intended functionality of this extension.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Error Logging:**  
  - Consider adding logging within the catch blocks (e.g. via `console.error` or a logging function) to capture error details without stopping execution. This aids in debugging while still allowing the extension to fail gracefully.
  
- **Modularisation:**  
  - If the project architecture allows, refactor the analytics function calls into separate helper functions. This would improve code readability and maintainability.
  
- **Defensive Checks for Global Objects:**  
  - Although eventType and eventPayload are guaranteed, adding simple checks for `LBGAnalytics` and its methods could produce better error messages. For example:
    - Check if `typeof LBGAnalytics !== "undefined"` before attempting to call the functions.
  
- **Inline Documentation:**  
  - Adding inline comments to the code can help future developers understand the logic faster.

*Note:* As ES5 is required, avoid using ES2015/ES6 constructs such as arrow functions, let/const, and template literals.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ownership and Responsibility:**  
  - Assign a specific team or individual as the owner for future updates and bug fixes to the extension.
  
- **Testing Strategy:**  
  - Integrate comprehensive unit tests or functional tests that simulate various scenarios including:
    - Normal operation.
    - Absence of required global objects.
    - Conflicts arising from other scripts.
  - Ensure that automated tests are run as part of the deployment process to catch any issues early.
  
- **Version Control and Documentation:**  
  - Maintain version history and change logs within the code repository. Ensure that any modifications to the analytics functions or their parameters are documented.
  
- **Monitoring:**  
  - Consider implementing a monitoring mechanism to detect when these analytics calls fail frequently in production. This can help in proactive debugging and resolution.
  
- **Stakeholder Communication:**  
  - Keep the documentation up-to-date and share it with relevant stakeholders to maintain transparency on how analytics events are processed.
