# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Extension Execution 2022 - Before Load Rules
- **ID:** 1688
- **Type:** Advanced Javascript Code
- **Scope:** Before Load Rules
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Always

### Summary
This extension is designed to execute specified functions before the load rules are processed in the Tealium iQ implementation. It integrates with the LBG Analytics library to manage event handling and ensure that necessary tracking activities are performed in a timely manner. The primary goal is to facilitate improved data tracking and event analytics by allowing early execution of relevant scripts.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- `eventType`: A string representing the type of event that has triggered the execution of the extension.
- `eventPayload`: An object containing the payload data associated with the event.

### Logic Flow
1. The extension wraps the core functionality inside an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) that takes `eventType` and `eventPayload` as parameters.
2. Two primary operations are attempted:
   - **First Try Block:** Calls `LBGAnalytics.extensions.run(a, b, "global.blr")`, where `a` is `eventType` and `b` is `eventPayload`. This method seems to handle the core extension processing.
   - **Second Try Block:** Executes `LBGAnalytics.santa.runRunners("blr", b)`. This likely triggers additional processing or runners associated with the specified event.

### Error Handling
Both blocks are wrapped in `try-catch` statements to gracefully handle any errors that may arise during execution. If an error occurs, it is silently ignored due to the comment `// never mind`.

### Dependencies
- The extension depends on the existence of `LBGAnalytics` and its associated methods, which should be loaded and available within the global scope when this extension is executed.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Operation
- **Scenario:** A user submits a form which triggers a `submit` event.
    - `eventType`: "submit"
    - `eventPayload`: { formId: 'contactForm', submittedData: {...} }
    - **Behaviour:** The extension runs, calling the respective functions to handle data tracking and analytics for the form submission.

### Edge Condition
- **Scenario:** If the `LBGAnalytics` object or the methods it contains is not defined when the extension runs.
    - **Behaviour:** The error handling will catch the exception, resulting in no feedback or tracking for this event, which may lead to data loss if not monitored.

---

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Event Handling Dependencies:** The extension requires `LBGAnalytics` to be available globally. If it is missing, no error messages will be displayed due to the existing error handling, potentially leading to confusion during debugging.
- **Conflict with Other Extensions:** If multiple extensions attempt to manipulate the same event data or rely on the same event type in quick succession, there may be conflicts that could result in incorrect data tracking.
- **Silent Failures:** The current error handling approach does not log errors. This can make it challenging to diagnose issues related to the execution of the extension.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Implement Logging:** Introduce a logging mechanism to capture errors instead of silently ignoring them. This could be as simple as using `console.error(e)` within the catch blocks.
- **Modularisation:** Consider breaking down complex event processing into smaller, manageable functions. This would improve code readability and maintainability.
- **Defensive Checks:** Ensure that both `LBGAnalytics.extensions` and `LBGAnalytics.santa` exist before attempting to call methods on them, even though it is guaranteed that `eventType` and `eventPayload` are present.
- **Documentation Comments:** Add comments within the code to explain the purpose of each main function call, which would aid future developers in understanding the intent quickly.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ownership:** Assign an owner to regularly review and update this extension to meet current business needs and to reflect changes in the LBG analytics framework.
- **Ongoing Testing:** Implement testing processes to validate the extensionâ€™s functionality in different environments, ensuring it responds correctly across varied event types and payloads.
- **Version Control:** Keep track of changes in a version control system and document each modification through commit messages to maintain a clear history of what has been altered or improved over time.
