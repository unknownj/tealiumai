# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: Visibility State

## 1. Extension Overview
- **Name**: Visibility State
- **ID**: 1689
- **Type**: Javascript Code
- **Scope**: After Load Rules
- **Execution Frequency**: Run Always

### Summary
The Visibility State extension captures the visibility state of the webpage and related timing metrics from the Tealium library. It combines three timing metrics (`syncVisibility`, `mainVisibility`, and `document.visibilityState`) into a single string, which is then processed to derive a simplified visibility state represented by the first character of each metric.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- **a**: This argument represents the `eventType` passed during execution.
- **b**: This argument is an object that serves as a context for storing the visibility state.

### Logic Flow
1. The extension accesses global objects:
   - `window.utag_timing.syncVisibility`: The time when the page was first rendered.
   - `window.utag_timing.mainVisibility`: The time when the page became visually the main focus.
   - `document.visibilityState`: The current visibility state of the document (`visible`, `hidden`, etc.).
   
2. These three values are concatenated with a `/` separator to form a single string.

3. The concatenated string is processed:
   - It's split into an array based on the `/` delimiter.
   - Each element of the array is transformed to capture the first character using `substring(0,1)`.
   - The first characters are then joined back into a string without any separators.

### Dependencies
- This code depends on the following global objects:
  - `window.utag_timing`: A Tealium-specific object that is expected to exist for timing metrics.
  - `document.visibilityState`: A standard DOM property indicating the visibility state of the document.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Execution
When the extension is triggered:
- Suppose the timings recorded are:
  - `syncVisibility`: 200ms
  - `mainVisibility`: 400ms
  - `document.visibilityState`: "visible"
  
The resulting string would be `2/4/v`, and after processing, the `VisibilityState` would be `24v`.

### Edge Conditions
1. **Document Hidden**
   - If the document is hidden:
     - `document.visibilityState`: "hidden"
     - Resulting `VisibilityState`: `24h` if the timings were the same as above.

2. **Timing Values Undefined**
   - If `syncVisibility` or `mainVisibility` were `undefined`, attempting to concatenate with `/` could yield unexpected results. However, this risks failing based on actual implementations within Tealium, which should ensure these values are always present.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas
- If the `utag_timing` object does not have the expected properties (`syncVisibility`, `mainVisibility`), it may cause the extension to produce misleading or no output.
- The extension may conflict with other Tealium extensions that manipulate global timing metrics or visibility state, potentially leading to overwriting values inadvertently.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring
- **Defensive Checks**: Verify if `window.utag_timing` and its properties are defined before accessing them. This helps prevent runtime errors.
- **Code Style**: Consider breaking down the logic into smaller functions for better readability and testing.
- **Modularization**: Enhance modularity by isolating the visibility state computation into a separate function that can be easily tested.
- **Comments**: Add inline comments to explain complex lines or logic, making it easier for future developers to maintain.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes
- **Owner**: Assign a dedicated person for ongoing maintenance and updates, ensuring knowledge continuity.
- **Testing Guidelines**:
  - Perform unit tests to validate the output for various scenarios, including visible, hidden, and undefined timing states.
  - Regularly verify compatibility with new versions of the Tealium library that may alter the structure of `utag_timing`.
- **Documentation Updates**: Review and update the documentation each time changes are made to the logic or if new requirements arise.
