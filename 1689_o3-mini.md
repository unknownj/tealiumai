# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: Visibility State

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the "Visibility State" extension, including its functionality, code explanation, usage examples, known limitations, recommendations for refactoring, and maintenance guidelines. This guide is intended for developers and stakeholders working with the Tealium iQ platform.

---

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Visibility State
- **ID:** 1689 (extensionId: 100036)
- **Type:** Javascript Code
- **Scope:** After Load Rules
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Always

**Summary:**  
The Visibility State extension is designed to capture and transform visibility-related data from both global variables and the browser’s document state. It aggregates values from `window.utag_timing.syncVisibility` and `window.utag_timing.mainVisibility`, as well as `document.visibilityState`, and produces a concatenated result comprising the first letters of each value. This output is then assigned to `eventPayload.VisibilityState`, which can be used by downstream processes or analytics tools. The extension is useful for tracking page visibility or performance metrics rapidly in a compact format.

## 2. Code Explanation

The extension code is wrapped in an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) that accepts two parameters:  
- `a`: Corresponds to `eventType` (a string, though not used in this code)  
- `b`: Corresponds to `eventPayload` (an object, where the result is stored)

### Key Variables and Logic Flow

1. **Global Object References:**  
   - `window.utag_timing.syncVisibility`: Expected to contain a string value representing the sync visibility state.
   - `window.utag_timing.mainVisibility`: Expected to contain a string value representing the main visibility state.
   - `document.visibilityState`: A standard property on the document that usually returns values such as "visible", "hidden", etc.

2. **Data Aggregation:**  
   The code builds a string consisting of the three values separated by forward slashes:
   ```
   b.VisibilityState = window.utag_timing.syncVisibility + "/" + window.utag_timing.mainVisibility + "/" + document.visibilityState;
   ```

3. **Mapping to Abbreviated Result:**  
   - The string is split into an array using the delimiter `/`.
   - The `.map()` function is used on the array to transform each string by taking its first character (i.e. using `substring(0,1)`).
   - The array of single characters is then joined back together without any separator, producing a compact string.
   - This final string is reassigned back to the `VisibilityState` property on the `eventPayload` object.

   For example, if the original string is `"visible/invisible/visible"`, it will be processed into `"v", "i", "v"` resulting in `"viv"`.

### Dependencies

- **Global Objects:**  
  The code depends on the presence of `window.utag_timing` (with properties `syncVisibility` and `mainVisibility`) and the standard `document.visibilityState`. It is assumed that these values are available and appropriately set in the runtime environment.

- **ES5 Syntax:**  
  The code is written using ES5-compliant syntax, ensuring compatibility with environments that do not support newer ECMAScript versions.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Standard Visibility Values

**Input:**
- `window.utag_timing.syncVisibility = "visible"`
- `window.utag_timing.mainVisibility = "visible"`
- `document.visibilityState = "visible"`

**Processing:**
1. Concatenated string: `"visible/visible/visible"`
2. Splitting results in: `["visible", "visible", "visible"]`
3. Mapping first characters: `["v", "v", "v"]`
4. Final result: `"vvv"`

**Output:**  
`eventPayload.VisibilityState` will be `"vvv"`.

---

### Scenario 2: Mixed Visibility States

**Input:**
- `window.utag_timing.syncVisibility = "hidden"`
- `window.utag_timing.mainVisibility = "visible"`
- `document.visibilityState = "hidden"`

**Processing:**
1. Concatenated string: `"hidden/visible/hidden"`
2. Splitting results in: `["hidden", "visible", "hidden"]`
3. Mapping first characters: `["h", "v", "h"]`
4. Final result: `"hvh"`

**Output:**  
`eventPayload.VisibilityState` will be `"hvh"`.

---

### Scenario 3: Edge Case with Short Values

**Input:**
- `window.utag_timing.syncVisibility = "n/a"`
- `window.utag_timing.mainVisibility = "n/a"`
- `document.visibilityState = "undefined"`

**Processing:**
1. Concatenated string: `"n/a/n/a/undefined"`
2. Splitting results in: `["n", "a", "n", "a", "undefined"]`  
   *(Note: This scenario assumes that a string containing a slash could lead to unexpected splitting; however, generally the expectation is that each property does not include the delimiter itself.)*
3. Mapping first characters (if the input values are as expected without extra slashes):  
   For well-formed values like `"n/a"`, care should be taken in input design.  
   Assuming proper delimiters and no double slashes, the expected array would be: `["n", "n", "u"]` which would join to `"nnu"`.

**Output:**  
`eventPayload.VisibilityState` will be `"nnu"` provided the values do not contain the delimiter unexpectedly.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Dependency on Global Properties:**  
  The extension assumes that `window.utag_timing.syncVisibility` and `window.utag_timing.mainVisibility` are defined and contain appropriate string values. If these are absent or not initialised, the code may not produce the desired result.
  
- **Delimiter Collision:**  
  If any of the input string values themselves contain the "/" character, the splitting logic may produce more segments than expected, leading to an incorrect concatenation of first characters.

- **Assumption on String Length:**  
  The code automatically uses the first character of each value. If any property has an empty string or unexpected value, the resulting output may be incomplete or lead to misinterpretation.

- **Interference by Other Extensions:**  
  If other Tealium extensions or external scripts modify `window.utag_timing` or `document.visibilityState` during the runtime, it could affect the output of this extension.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Improved Validation:**  
  Although currently the availability of `eventType` and `eventPayload` is guaranteed, it would be beneficial to ensure that `window.utag_timing` and the required properties (`syncVisibility` and `mainVisibility`) are available and are strings before processing. This helps avoid unexpected runtime errors in complex environments.

- **Delimiter Safety:**  
  Consider ensuring that the input strings do not contain the "/" character, or choose an alternative delimiter that is less likely to collide with the input data.

- **Code Clarity:**  
  Use descriptive variable names for intermediate steps. Although constrained by ES5 syntax, separating parts of the logic into well-named functions (within the ES5 limitations) could improve readability and maintainability.

- **Error Logging:**  
  Adding logging for debugging purposes (if allowed by the platform) can help track issues when unexpected values are encountered.

*Note: Defensive coding for the presence of `eventType` and `eventPayload` is not necessary, as these are guaranteed to be available by Tealium.*

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ownership:**  
  Assign a maintainer or team responsible for regularly reviewing and testing this extension, especially when integrating with new updates to the Tealium iQ platform or browser standards.

- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  Develop unit tests or manual test cases covering a variety of scenarios (including edge cases with unusual input strings). Ensure consistent behaviour across different browser environments that support ES5.

- **Documentation Updates:**  
  Keep the documentation updated with any changes to global data sources (e.g. modifications to `window.utag_timing`) or changes in the expected output format for downstream systems.

- **Change Management:**  
  Use version control (such as Git) to track changes to this extension’s code. Maintain a change log documenting reasons for updates or alterations in the logic.

- **Future Considerations:**  
  If the platform environment upgrades to support ES6 or later, consider refactoring the code to improve readability and efficiency using modern JavaScript features while keeping backwards compatibility if necessary.
