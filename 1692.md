# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: SR Icons

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name**: SR Icons
- **ID**: 1692
- **Type**: Javascript Code
- **Scope**: 928
- **Execution Frequency**: Approximately 1% of events

### Summary
The SR Icons extension is designed to capture information about the "Spending Rewards" icons utilized in a user's interface and send this data to Adobe Analytics via props. This extension aims to enhance insights into user interaction with these icons, particularly within accordion or image elements on the webpage.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- `a`, `b`, `u`: Parameters representing incoming values â€“ specific usage within the function is unspecified as this is a pattern often used for event-driven extensions.
- `s`: Refers to the global Adobe Analytics object (typically the `s` object), used to set properties for tracking.
- `img`: A jQuery array containing elements selected based on specific class names for the "Spending Rewards" icons.

### Logic Flow
1. The function executes upon an event trigger (denoted by `eventType` and `eventPayload`).
2. A random check (1% probability) is performed to determine if the extension will proceed.
3. It identifies images on the page with the specified class names: 
   - `sn-sr-accordion-title-accordion-image`
   - `sn-sraov-img`
4. If valid images are found, one image is randomly selected and removed from the collection.
5. The `alt` text and `src` attribute of the selected image are then concatenated and stored in the Analytics properties `s.prop61` and `s.prop62`.
6. Data captured provides context for user interactions with the identified icons.

### Dependencies
- The code relies on jQuery for DOM manipulation, specifically the `$` function for selecting and manipulating DOM elements.
- It interacts with the global Adobe Analytics `s` object, which must be present for proper functionality of the extension.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Normal Operation
- When a user interacts with certain icons on the page, a random 1% chance allows the code to run. If the conditions align, the icon's `alt` text and `src` are successfully captured and recorded in `s.prop61` and `s.prop62`.

### Scenario 2: Edge Condition
- If no icons match the specified classes on the page, or if fewer icons are available than anticipated, no properties are set in the `s` object, and no data is captured. However, the absence of images does not invoke any errors; the script simply completes without action.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- The randomness of icon selection implies data capture may be inconsistent. Only 1% of events are processed, which might lead to low visibility of icon interactions in the reports.
- If the jQuery library is not loaded prior to this script's execution, there will be errors, and the extension will fail to run as intended.
- Conflicts may occur if other Tealium extensions or external scripts use the same global `s` properties, leading to data being overwritten.
- Variations in the class name structure can lead to undiscovered images, thus limiting the data captured.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks**: Although not required, adding checks to ensure `img.length > 0` before attempting to splice could avoid errors even though it is highly unlikely.
- **Modularisation**: Consider breaking the code into function segments for better readability and maintainability, encapsulating the random selection and property assignment into separate functions.
- **Documentation**: Include comments within the code to clarify the purpose of each section and variable for future developers.
- **Code Style**: Ensure consistency in naming conventions and maintain readability through appropriate spacing and line breaks.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ownership**: Assign a designated team member for ongoing ownership of this extension, ensuring they are familiar with both the logic and the data requirements of Adobe Analytics.
- **Testing Guidelines**: Regularly validate the extension in different environments to ensure functionality under various scenarios, especially after page design changes.
- **Documentation Updates**: Keep this documentation updated with any modifications made to the code or logic, ensuring it remains a helpful resource for current and future developers.

By following the outlined structure, this documentation provides a comprehensive overview and clear guidelines to aid in the utilisation and maintenance of the SR Icons extension in Tealium iQ.
