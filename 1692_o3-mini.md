# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: SR Icons

This document provides a comprehensive overview, explanation, usage examples, limitations, refactoring recommendations, and maintenance notes for the SR Icons Tealium iQ extension.

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** SR Icons  
- **Extension ID:** 100036  
- **Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** 928  
- **Execution Frequency:** Conditional and probabilistic – the main logic is executed only when:
  - The global variable s exists
  - Both s.prop61 and s.prop62 are undefined (or falsy)
  - Math.random() returns a value lower than 0.01 (approximately a 1% chance)

**Summary:**  
This extension randomly selects an image from the page elements with specific CSS classes ("sn-sr-accordion-title-accordion-image" or "sn-sraov-img") and assigns descriptive information about the selected image—namely the image's alt attribute and a part of its src attribute—to tracking properties (s.prop61 and s.prop62). This is likely used for reporting or analysis in a web analytics context (for example, Adobe Analytics using the s object).

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables and Data Flow

- **s:**  
  A global tracking object expected to exist in the page’s scope. Properties on this object (prop61 and prop62) are used to store the results of the extension’s execution. If these properties already have values, the extension does not proceed with its execution.

- **img:**  
  A jQuery selection that gathers all `<img>` elements with either of the following classes:
  - "sn-sr-accordion-title-accordion-image"
  - "sn-sraov-img"

  The `.get()` method converts the jQuery object into an array of DOM elements.

### Logic Flow

1. **Initial Condition Check:**  
   The extension first confirms:
   - The global object s exists.
   - Both s.prop61 and s.prop62 are not set.
   - A random check (`Math.random() < 0.01`) passes (approx. 1% execution rate).

2. **Image Selection:**  
   - Collects all matching `<img>` elements into an array.
   - A random index is determined using `Math.floor(Math.random() * img.length)`.
   - The code then uses `splice` to remove one element from the array at the generated random index. This operation returns an array containing one element.

3. **Processing the Selected Image:**  
   - The code uses the `.map()` function on the spliced array (which generally contains a single element) to:
     - Set `s.prop61` statically to "Spending Rewards Icon".
     - Set `s.prop62` by:
       - Retrieving the image's `alt` attribute.
       - Splitting the image's `src` attribute by "=" and taking the second part.
       - Joining both values with the separator " !! ".
   - Finally, `[0]` is used to access the first (and only) element of the mapped array, although this return value is not used further.

### Dependencies

- **jQuery:**  
  The extension utilises jQuery for DOM element selection (`$("img...")`) and array conversion (`.get()`).

- **Global Object 's':**  
  The tracking object (commonly associated with web analytics solutions) is vital for the extension’s operation.

- **Event Variables:**  
  The extension is wrapped in an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) that receives three parameters (`eventType, eventPayload, tagObject`). However, these parameters are not utilised within the extension logic.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Scenario

- **Preconditions:**
  - Global tracking object s exists.
  - s.prop61 and s.prop62 are not populated.
  - The page contains one or more `<img>` elements with classes "sn-sr-accordion-title-accordion-image" or "sn-sraov-img".
  
- **Flow:**
  - When the extension code is executed, there is a 1% probability that it will run.
  - A random image from the matching set is selected.
  - s.prop61 is set to "Spending Rewards Icon".
  - s.prop62 is set to a string combining the image’s alt text and a segment of the src attribute (extracted after “=”).

### Edge Cases

- **No Matching Images:**
  - If there are no `<img>` elements with the specified selectors, the `img` array will have a length of 0. In this event, the random selection calculation will always return 0; however, attempting to splice an empty array might lead to unintended behaviour.

- **Properties Pre-Set:**
  - If either s.prop61 or s.prop62 already contains a value, the extension will not execute, ensuring that it does not overwrite existing tracking information.

- **Random Chance Failing:**
  - In 99% of cases (based on the random condition), the extension’s logic will not run even if all other conditions are met.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Empty Image Array:**
  - There is no explicit check to ensure the `img` array has elements before attempting the random selection and splice operation. This could lead to errors if the array is empty.
  
- **Global Dependencies:**
  - The extension relies on the existence and correct configuration of the global "s" object and jQuery. If these dependencies change or are not loaded, the extension could fail.

- **Execution Frequency:**
  - Due to the probabilistic nature (1% chance) of execution, tracking data may be inconsistent or scatter-shot, which might be confusion during testing or analysis if not properly documented.

- **Splice and Map Usage:**
  - The use of `splice` to remove a randomly selected element and immediately mapping over it is non-standard. Developers unfamiliar with this pattern may find the code confusing.

- **CSS Selector Dependency:**
  - The extension’s correct operation depends heavily on the presence of defined CSS classes. If these classes are renamed or removed in the HTML/CSS, the extension will not pick up any images.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Check Array Length:**  
  Add a defensive check to ensure the `img` array is not empty before attempting to remove or process an image element.
  
- **Clarify Code Flow:**  
  Instead of chaining `splice` and `map` in a single statement, consider breaking them into separate steps. This would improve readability and maintainability.

- **Variable Naming:**  
  Provide more descriptive variable names for better clarity (e.g. use `selectedImage` instead of anonymous parameters within the map).

- **Avoid Over-reliance on Global Objects:**  
  Although support for eventType and eventPayload is not a concern here, document the expected state of the global "s" object clearly and consider safe-check patterns.

- **Code Comments:**  
  Increase inline comments especially around the random selection and string manipulation logic for ease of future maintenance.

- **Adherence to ES5:**  
  Continue to use ES5 syntax (i.e. avoid arrow functions, template literals, and let/const). Ensure that any new additions or refactored code remains ES5-compatible.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Version Control and Ownership:**  
  - Tag this extension with a version number and maintain proper Git version control to track any future changes.
  - Assign clear ownership for the extension within your development team for ongoing support and troubleshooting.

- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Develop unit tests or manual test cases to simulate scenarios when images are present and when they are not.
  - Test the extension under various conditions to ensure that the 1% execution rate does not interfere with regular operations.
  
- **Documentation Updates:**  
  - Regularly update documentation to reflect any changes in the HTML structure, dependencies (like changes in the jQuery version), or modifications to the global tracking object.

- **Conflict Management:**  
  - Review any other Tealium or external extensions that might modify the "s" object to avoid overwriting or data collisions.
  - If other scripts manipulate elements with the same CSS selectors, ensure that execution order is managed appropriately.

- **Performance Considerations:**  
  - Although the extension runs infrequently, ensure that the random selection and DOM queries are as efficient as possible, especially if deployed on pages with a large number of images.
