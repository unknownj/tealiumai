# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation – SCEP Components

This document provides a comprehensive overview and explanation of the "SCEP Components" extension deployed via Tealium iQ. It covers the extension’s purpose, code logic, usage examples, known limitations, refactoring recommendations, and maintenance guidelines.

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** SCEP Components  
- **Extension ID:** 100036 (external), with an internal ID of 1696  
- **Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** 928  
- **Execution Frequency:** Approximately 1% of page views  
  - The extension’s key logic is executed only if conditions are met (i.e. a Math.random() check with a probability threshold of 0.01).

**Summary:**  
This extension samples the DOM by iterating over all elements on the page, extracts CSS class names that start with "c-", and randomly selects one class. It then transforms the class name into a specific format (an "AEM" component inventory tag) and assigns the formatted value to two global properties (`s.prop61` and `s.prop62`) on the `s` object. This allows tracking or inventorying of AEM (Adobe Experience Manager) components used on the page.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables and Parameters
- **Input Parameters:**  
  - `eventType` (passed as variable `a`)  
  - `eventPayload` (passed as variable `b`)  
  - `tagObject` (passed as variable `u`)  
  *(Note: The code does not further process these parameters.)*

- **Global Object Dependency:**  
  - The variable `s` is assumed to exist in the global scope and is used to set `prop61` and `prop62` properties.
  
### Main Logic Flow
1. **Execution Condition Check:**  
   - The code first checks if the global `s` object exists and also ensures that `s.prop61` and `s.prop62` are undefined.  
   - It uses `Math.random() < 0.01` to ensure that the sampling is performed on roughly 1% of executions.

2. **DOM Element Collection:**  
   - The code gathers all DOM elements using `document.querySelectorAll("*")` and converts the NodeList to an array using `Array.prototype.slice.call`.

3. **CSS Class Extraction and Counting:**  
   - Each element is checked for a `class` attribute. If present, the attribute is split into individual class names.  
   - Only classes that begin with "c-" are considered.  
   - A count of occurrences for each matching class is maintained in the `classes` object.

4. **Random Class Selection:**  
   - A list of keys (unique class names beginning with "c-") is extracted from the `classes` object.  
   - A random class is selected from this list.

5. **Formatting the Class into an Identifier:**  
   - The chosen class name is split on hyphens.  
   - The code constructs a new identifier (`classID`) in the following format:  
     "AEM/<first-two-pieces joined with a hyphen>/<remaining pieces joined with a hyphen>".
   - This formatted string is used to provide a structured reference to an AEM component.

6. **Assigning Global Tracking Properties:**  
   - If a valid `classID` is formed, the extension assigns:
     - `s.prop61` is given the string "AEM Component Inventory".
     - `s.prop62` is set to the generated `classID`.

### Dependencies
- **DOM API:** The code uses standard DOM APIs like `document.querySelectorAll` and attributes manipulation methods.
- **Global Variables:** Depends on the global `s` object for setting tracking parameters.  
- **Math.random():** Utilised for probabilistic execution (1% sampling).

## 3. Usage Examples

### Sample Scenario 1 – Normal Execution
- **Condition:**  
  - Global object `s` is available and does not have `prop61` or `prop62` set.
  - The random check passes (e.g. Math.random() returns 0.005).
- **Process:**  
  - The extension gathers all the page elements, finds classes that begin with "c-", and counts occurrences.
  - Suppose it finds the class "c-header-banner" among others.
  - It selects "c-header-banner" randomly from the list.
  - The class is split into pieces: ["c", "header", "banner"].
  - The new identifier is generated as "AEM/c-header/banner".
  - `s.prop61` is set to "AEM Component Inventory" and `s.prop62` to "AEM/c-header/banner".
- **Outcome:**  
  - This data can then be used or reported for tracking AEM component usage.

### Sample Scenario 2 – Edge Condition (No Matching Classes)
- **Condition:**  
  - There are no elements with a class that begins with "c-".
- **Process:**  
  - The `classes` object remains empty.
  - The list of keys is empty and selecting a random class results in `undefined`.
- **Outcome:**  
  - The execution will effectively do nothing, as `classID` will be falsy and the `if (classID)` block will not execute.
  - No properties will be set on `s`.

### Sample Scenario 3 – Repeated Execution Prevention
- **Condition:**  
  - `s.prop61` or `s.prop62` is already set due to a previous run.
- **Process:**  
  - The initial condition (`if (s && !s.prop61 && !s.prop62 && Math.random() < 0.01)`) fails.
- **Outcome:**  
  - The extension does not reassign the properties, preventing unnecessary reprocessing or data overwriting.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **DOM Intensity:**  
  - Iterating over every element on the page can be intensive, especially for pages with a high number of nodes.
  
- **Random Sampling:**  
  - With only a 1% execution rate, infrequent (or no) data may be collected on pages with low traffic.
  
- **Global Dependence:**  
  - The extension depends on the existence and structure of the global `s` object. If the `s` object is not configured correctly, the code will not execute as expected.
  
- **Edge Cases with Class Names:**  
  - If the randomly selected class name does not have enough hyphen-separated segments, the generated identifier may not be very informative.
  
- **Potential Conflicts:**  
  - Other Tealium extensions or external scripts may also modify or rely on `s.prop61` and `s.prop62`. Ensure that naming conventions do not conflict.
  
- **Execution Frequency:**  
  - The Math.random() condition might lead to inconsistent data collection over time, making statistical analysis challenging if not appropriately monitored.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks and Robustness:**  
  - While the presence of `eventType` and `eventPayload` is guaranteed, additional checks on the DOM elements (e.g. ensuring a valid class attribute string) can help avoid unexpected errors.
  
- **Optimising DOM Traversal:**  
  - Consider limiting the scope of DOM queries if it is known that only a section of the page contains "c-" classes. This can improve performance.
  
- **Modularising Code:**  
  - Breaking the functionality into smaller helper functions (e.g. one function for extracting classes, one for generating the identifier) can improve readability and maintainability.
  
- **Documentation and Naming:**  
  - Further in-code comments explaining the purpose of each code block can assist future developers in understanding and maintaining the extension.
  
- **ES5 Compatibility:**  
  - Continue to adhere strictly to ES5 standards. Avoid ES6 features such as arrow functions, template literals, and let/const to ensure compatibility across environments.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  - Regularly verify that the `s` global object remains in the expected state and that no conflicting scripts or extensions override the tracking properties.
  - Monitor the random sampling rate to confirm that the data collection percentage remains within acceptable limits.

- **Ownership and Testing:**  
  - Designate a developer or team responsible for Tealium implementation who periodically tests the extension (e.g. by triggering the code manually with controlled DOM elements).
  - Maintain a version-controlled repository of the extension code with detailed commit messages to document any changes or refactorings.

- **Integration Testing:**  
  - Incorporate this extension into a larger suite of integration tests to ensure that any updates to the page structure or global objects do not break its functionality.
  - Test across different browsers that rely on ES5 to ensure consistent behaviour.

- **Further Enhancement:**  
  - Future improvements might include a configuration UI within Tealium iQ for dynamically adjusting parameters (such as sampling rate or class prefix), but such enhancements should still adhere to ES5 standards.
