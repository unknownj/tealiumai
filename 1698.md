# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Add DL Cache Function if not already available
- **ID:** 1698
- **Type:** Javascript Code
- **Scope:** Pre Loader
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Once

### Summary
This extension adds a caching mechanism to the `LBGAnalytics.datalayer` object if it is not already present. The caching functionality allows for efficient retrieval of data from the data layer by avoiding repeated calls and ensuring that only the latest data is considered.

---

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- `dl`: Represents the `LBGAnalytics.datalayer` object which contains the methods for interacting with the data layer.
- `dlCache`: A variable that stores the latest state of the data layer when the `getCache()` method is invoked.
- `latest`: A boolean flag that indicates whether the cached data is the most recent.

### Logic Flow
1. **Initial Check:** The extension verifies if `LBGAnalytics`, `LBGAnalytics.datalayer`, and the `getCache` method do not already exist.
2. **Self-Executing Function:** A self-executing function is created to encapsulate functionality related to the caching mechanism.
3. **Refresh Logic:** A `refresh()` function is defined to update `dlCache` with the latest data whenever `dl.get()` is called.
4. **Change Listener:** An event listener is attached to the data layer to set `latest` to `false` whenever there is a change in the data layer, prompting a cache refresh on the next `getCache()` invocation.
5. **Get Cache Method:** A method `getCache()` is defined to allow retrieval of cached data or a specific variable if provided.

### Dependencies
- The extension relies on the global `LBGAnalytics` object and requires `LBGAnalytics.datalayer` to be available for proper functionality.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Condition
In a typical scenario, after the extension has run:
```javascript
// Access the entire cached data layer
var allData = LBGAnalytics.datalayer.getCache();

// Access specific data points
var specificVariable = LBGAnalytics.datalayer.getCache('targetVariable');
```

### Edge Conditions
1. **No Changes in Data Layer:** If the data layer hasn’t changed since the last call, `getCache()` will return the cached data without calling `dl.get()`.
2. **Change Notification:** When the data layer is updated (e.g., a push event occurs), the next call to `getCache()` will fetch the new data.

---

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Cache Refresh Timing:** If `getCache()` is called before the data layer has had any changes, it may return outdated data until a change occurs.
- **Conflict with Other Extensions:** If another extension modifies the `LBGAnalytics.datalayer` object or its methods, it may interfere with this extension’s caching logic.
- **Global Object Dependence:** The extension fails if the `LBGAnalytics` object is not available or is altered external to this extension.

---

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks:** While we are not focusing on defensive coding for certain guaranteed properties, consider adding checks for other conditions that could potentially disrupt functionality (e.g., ensuring `dl.get()` returns objects as expected).
- **Code Style Consistency:** Maintain consistent indentation and spacing for better readability, ensuring that all properties and methods are clearly identifiable.
- **Modularisation:** Consider breaking down the caching logic into more modular functions to facilitate easier maintenance and testing in the future.

---

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:** Regularly review the extension particularly after upgrades to `LBGAnalytics` to ensure compatibility.
- **Ownership:** Designate a developer or team responsible for overseeing updates and best practices related to this extension.
- **Testing Guidelines:** Implement unit tests that simulate various configurations of the data layer to confirm that the caching mechanism behaves as expected under all conditions.
