# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: Add DL Cache Function if Not Already Available

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name**: Add DL Cache Function if not already available
- **ID**: 1698
- **Type**: Javascript Code
- **Scope**: Pre Loader
- **Execution Frequency**: Run Once

### Summary
This extension is designed to enhance the functionality of the LBGAnalytics data layer by adding a caching mechanism if it does not already exist. The primary purpose of this extension is to ensure that data from the data layer can be efficiently retrieved without unnecessary re-fetching, thus improving performance and responsiveness in data handling.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- `dlCache`: Stores the current state of the data layer fetched from `dl.get()`.
- `latest`: A Boolean flag indicating whether the cached data is the most recent; initially set to `false`.

### Logic Flow
1. The code checks if `LBGAnalytics`, its `datalayer`, and the cache function (`getCache`) are defined.
2. An Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) is executed with `LBGAnalytics.datalayer` as its argument.
3. Inside this IIFE:
   - The `refresh` function is defined to update the `dlCache` variable and set `latest` to `true`.
   - An event listener is added to trigger when the data layer changes, setting `latest` to `false` when this occurs.
4. The `getCache` function is added to the `datalayer`:
   - If the cached data is not the latest, it refreshes the cache.
   - It allows optional access to a specific variable within `dlCache` or returns the entire cache.
5. Finally, the function `LBGAnalytics.Q.setDataObject` is called to set the data object to the result of the `getCache` function.

### Dependencies
This extension relies on the global object `LBGAnalytics` and its `datalayer` functionality. It assumes that these are loaded prior to the execution of the extension.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Conditions
- **Scenario**: An event triggers data changes in the data layer.
  - Before the trigger, the cache is empty. Upon triggering:
    1. The data layer is updated.
    2. The `change` event fires, and `latest` is set to `false`.
    3. Accessing `LBGAnalytics.datalayer.getCache()` will refresh the cache, allowing access to the most recent data.

### Edge Conditions
- **Scenario**: Retrieving a variable that doesn't exist in the data layer.
  - If `optionalVariable` is passed to `getCache` which does not exist:
    - The method will return `undefined` without errors, allowing graceful handling of missing data.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Cache Initialization**: If `LBGAnalytics` or `datalayer` is not defined when the extension runs, caching will not be set up, potentially leading to unexpected behaviours which can affect performance.
- **Potential Conflicts**: The extension should be tested alongside other Tealium extensions that manipulate the same data layer, as changes in state by one extension might inadvertently affect another.
- **Single Instance Only**: The design is built for a single instance of the caching mechanism. Multiple extensions trying to implement similar caching will lead to conflicts.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

1. **Defensive Checks**: Ensure that checks are in place before accessing properties of `dl` to avoid runtime errors.
2. **Code Style**: Maintain consistent indentation and line length for readability. Use conventional variable names to enhance code understanding.
3. **Modularisation**: Consider breaking down the functionality into smaller reusable functions if future functionalities necessitate it.
4. **Commenting**: Add comments within the code to explain the purpose of functions and complex logic sections.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance**: Regularly check for compatibility with updates to the LBGAnalytics library as well as other Tealium extensions to ensure continued functionality.
- **Ownership**: Designate a developer or team responsible for ownership and updates of this extension.
- **Testing Guidelines**: Employ rigorous testing whenever there are updates to the LBGAnalytics library or when new changes to the application are made. Manual testing in a staging environment is recommended to ensure smooth operation before going live.
