# Performance Timings Extension Documentation

This document details the "Performance Timings" Tealium iQ extension, including an overview, code explanation, usage examples, known limitations, recommendations for refactoring, and maintenance notes. The aim is to provide other developers and stakeholders with a clear understanding of the extension's functionality and implementation details.

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Performance Timings  
- **Extension ID:** 1699  
- **Library Extension ID:** 100036  
- **Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** After Load Rules  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Once

**Summary:**  
The extension captures various performance timing metrics from the browser's Navigation Timing API and dispatches these metrics as events to the LBGAnalytics system. It retrieves the navigation timing data, validates that the page has loaded (by checking that loadEventEnd is greater than 0), and then triggers a series of generic events, each with a specific event ID and corresponding timing value. Each metric is processed to ensure that it does not exceed a maximum cap of 60000 milliseconds.

---

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables and Objects

- **p:**  
  The variable `p` stores the first entry of type "navigation" from the array returned by `performance.getEntriesByType("navigation")`. This entry contains all the timing metrics related to the navigation of the current document.

- **LBGAnalytics.events.genericEvent:**  
  This is a globally available method used to dispatch events with specific metrics. It is chained multiple times to send various performance timing events.

### Logic Flow

1. **Retrieval of Navigation Timing Data:**  
   The code retrieves an entry from `performance.getEntriesByType("navigation")`. It assumes that the first entry (if available) contains timing information for the current page, stored in variable `p`.

2. **Validation:**  
   The extension checks if the `loadEventEnd` property of the navigation entry is greater than 0. This confirms that the page load event has successfully completed and thus the timing data is valid.

3. **Dispatching Events:**  
   If the condition is met, the code makes a series of calls to `LBGAnalytics.events.genericEvent`, each with a specific event ID and a corresponding performance metric that is:
   - Rounded down using `Math.floor`.
   - Restricted to a maximum value of 60000 milliseconds using `Math.min(60000, ...)`.

   The dispatched events include:
   - **Event 370:** Constant value of 1.
   - **Event 371:** `p.connectEnd`
   - **Event 372:** `p.responseEnd`
   - **Event 373:** `p.domContentLoadedEventEnd`
   - **Event 374:** `p.domComplete`
   - **Event 375:** `p.domInteractive`
   - **Event 376:** `p.loadEventEnd`
   - **Event 377:** Difference between `p.connectEnd` and `p.fetchStart`
   - **Event 378:** Difference between `p.responseEnd` and `p.requestStart`
   - **Event 379:** Difference between `p.domContentLoadedEventEnd` and `p.domContentLoadedEventStart`
   - **Event 380:** Difference between `p.loadEventEnd` and `p.loadEventStart`

4. **Function Parameters:**  
   The function is defined with two parameters (`a` and `b`), which are passed the values of `eventType` and `eventPayload` when the extension is invoked. However, these parameters are not actually used within the current code logic.

### Dependencies

- **Browser Navigation Timing API:**  
  The code relies on the browser's `performance` object and its method `getEntriesByType` to retrieve the navigation entry.

- **LBGAnalytics Object:**  
  The extension requires the global `LBGAnalytics` object which provides the `events.genericEvent` method used for dispatching timing events.

---

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Operation

- **Scenario:**  
  A user navigates to a webpage and the browser fully loads the page. The `performance.getEntriesByType("navigation")[0]` returns a valid navigation entry where `loadEventEnd > 0`.

- **Data Flow:**  
  The extension retrieves the navigation entry and processes values such as `connectEnd`, `responseEnd`, and `domContentLoadedEventEnd`. For instance, if `p.connectEnd` is 120 ms, the extension sends event 371 with the value 120 ms (after applying `Math.floor` and ensuring it is below the 60000 ms cap).

### Edge Condition

- **Scenario:**  
  If, for any reason, the performance data indicates `p.loadEventEnd` is 0 (perhaps due to the page not finishing its load), the extension will not dispatch any events. This ensures that incomplete or invalid performance data is not sent.

- **Data Flow:**  
  The conditional check `if(p.loadEventEnd > 0)` prevents the execution of the chained event calls, and thus no performance metrics are reported.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Browser Compatibility:**  
  The extension depends on the Navigation Timing API available in modern browsers. Older browsers that do not support `performance.getEntriesByType` may result in a failure to obtain the performance entry.

- **Missing Performance Entry:**  
  In cases where `performance.getEntriesByType("navigation")` does not return any entries or returns unexpected values, the extension will not trigger any events.

- **Global Dependencies:**  
  Since the extension relies on the global `LBGAnalytics` object, any changes or removal of this object in the broader system may cause the extension to fail.

- **Potential Conflicts:**  
  If other Tealium extensions or external scripts modify or interfere with the performance API or the `LBGAnalytics` object, unexpected behaviour may occur.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks:**  
  Although current implementation guarantees the availability of `eventType` (string) and `eventPayload` (object), it may be beneficial to include a check to verify that the navigation entry (`p`) exists before accessing its properties. For example, ensure that `p` is defined and has the expected properties.

- **Modularisation:**  
  Consider breaking down the code into smaller helper functions for better readability and maintainability. For instance:
  - A helper function to cap a given metric to 60000 ms.
  - Another helper function to send a generic event, reducing repeated code.

- **Code Style:**  
  Ensure that the code adheres to ES5 syntax to maintain compatibility. Use clear variable naming and consistent indentation to improve readability.

- **Commenting:**  
  Include inline comments that explain the purpose of each major code block, especially the computations for different performance metrics.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Testing:**  
  Regularly test the extension across different browsers and environments to ensure compatibility with the Navigation Timing API. Include unit tests to simulate scenarios where timing values change or are missing.

- **Ownership:**  
  Document the owner or team responsible for maintaining the extension. Establish a process for reviewing and updating the extension as web performance metrics or analytics requirements evolve.

- **Version Control:**  
  Keep a version history of the extension within your Tealium iQ environment or an accompanying source control system. This facilitates rollbacks and audits if any issues arise.

- **Monitoring Dependencies:**  
  Monitor updates or changes to the `LBGAnalytics` object and the browser performance API, as these are critical to the functionality of the extension.

- **Performance Impact:**  
  Although the extension is designed to run once after load rules, monitor the overall performance impact on page load times, especially on pages with heavy traffic or complex measurements.

This comprehensive documentation should provide the necessary details for developers and stakeholders to understand, maintain, and potentially improve the "Performance Timings" extension within Tealium iQ.
