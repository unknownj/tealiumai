# GA4 : Set GA4EventTitle Extension Documentation

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** GA4 : Set GA4EventTitle  
- **ID:** 1700  
- **Extension Type:** Advanced Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** After Load Rules  
- **Occurrence (Execution Frequency):** Run Always  

**Summary:**  
This extension processes a data layer variable, PegasusTagName, to derive a custom GA4 (Google Analytics 4) virtual event title. It manipulates the string by splitting it into segments, removing initial segments as well as unwanted keywords like "Sales" and "NA", and then constructs a new event name. The final output is a lower case, underscore-separated string that is assigned to GA4VirtualEventTitle. This allows for a standardised naming convention to be used for virtual events in GA4.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables and Functions

- **set_ga4_custom_events(dl):**  
  This function takes an object (named dl) which is expected to contain the PegasusTagName property.  
  - **dl:** Data layer object containing various variables including PegasusTagName.
  - **arr:** An array resulting from splitting dl.PegasusTagName by the delimiter " | ". This array represents different segments of information.
  - **event_name:** A string that will hold the final custom event title.

### Logic Flow

1. **Initial Splitting:**  
   - The value of dl.PegasusTagName is split by " | " into an array called arr.
   - The first two elements of arr are always removed using the splice method with parameters (0, 2).

2. **Removing Specific Keywords:**  
   - The function iterates over the remaining elements of the array to remove any segment exactly equal to "Sales".  
   - A conditional check is performed during the loop and if matched, arr.splice(i, 1) is executed. Note that this can potentially skip elements if multiple "Sales" values appear consecutively.

3. **Trimming the Array:**  
   - If the modified array has more than two elements, the last element is removed (likely accounting for a trailing segment that is not required).

4. **Second Keyword Removal:**  
   - The function loops through the array again and removes any segment equal to "NA".

5. **Final String Construction:**  
   - The array is joined into a single string with each element separated by a space.
   - The resulting string is then converted to lower case and all spaces are replaced with underscores to create a standardised event title format.

6. **Assignment to Global Object:**  
   - The final custom event title is assigned to the GA4VirtualEventTitle property of the object passed as b (which maps to eventPayload).  
   - The invocation is done through an immediately-invoked function expression (IIFE) with parameters (eventType, eventPayload).

### Dependencies

- **Global Data Objects:**  
  The code relies on two global objects: `eventType` and `eventPayload`. These are assumed to be available and are passed into the IIFE.  
- **Data Layer Variable:**  
  The presence and format of `PegasusTagName` within the provided data object (b or dl) is essential for proper execution.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Sample Scenario 1: Normal Processing

**Input Data (PegasusTagName):**  
"Header1 | Header2 | Event | Action | NA | Extra"  

**Processing Steps:**
- Split into array: ["Header1", "Header2", "Event", "Action", "NA", "Extra"]
- Remove first two elements: ["Event", "Action", "NA", "Extra"]
- Loop to remove "Sales": (No change as "Sales" is not present)
- If array length > 2, remove last element: ["Event", "Action", "NA"]
- Loop to remove "NA": Resulting in ["Event", "Action"]
- Join with a space: "Event Action"
- Convert to lower case and replace spaces: "event_action"  

**Output:**  
The GA4VirtualEventTitle is set to "event_action".

### Sample Scenario 2: With Keyword "Sales"

**Input Data (PegasusTagName):**  
"Header A | Header B | Sales | Conversion | NA"  

**Processing Steps:**
- Split into array: ["Header A", "Header B", "Sales", "Conversion", "NA"]
- Remove first two elements: ["Sales", "Conversion", "NA"]
- Loop to remove "Sales": ["Conversion", "NA"]
- If array length > 2, condition does not apply (length equals 2)
- Loop to remove "NA": ["Conversion"]
- Join with a space: "Conversion"
- Convert to lower case and replace spaces: "conversion"  

**Output:**  
The GA4VirtualEventTitle is set to "conversion".

### Sample Scenario 3: Edge Condition

**Input Data (PegasusTagName):**  
"Start | Continue | NA | Sales"  

**Processing Steps:**
- Split into array: ["Start", "Continue", "NA", "Sales"]
- Remove first two elements: ["NA", "Sales"]
- Loop to remove "Sales":  
  - First iteration: checks "NA", no match.  
  - Second iteration: "Sales" gets removed, resulting in ["NA"].
- Condition checking for array length > 2 does not apply (length is now 1)
- Loop to remove "NA": (["NA"] becomes [] after removal)
- Join results in an empty string  
- Final output after lower case conversion: an empty string

**Output:**  
GA4VirtualEventTitle is set to an empty string. This demonstrates that if the remaining segments are entirely removed, an empty event title may result.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- The removal loops use splice within a for-loop. When an element is removed, the array indices change and could potentially skip elements if multiple adjacent unwanted values exist.
- The logic condition that removes the last element when the array contains more than two elements might not be universally applicable if all data formats vary.
- Assumes that PegasusTagName is always defined and in the expected format (delimited by " | "). If not, it may result in errors or unexpected behaviour.
- The extension does not include error handling or logging; misformatting in PegasusTagName is silently processed which might lead to misleading outputs.
- Potential conflict if other extensions modify GA4VirtualEventTitle before or after this extension runs.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

While maintaining ES5 compatibility, consider the following improvements:

- Check the length of the array before splicing to avoid skipping elements.  
  • For example, when removing "Sales" and "NA" items, loop backwards through the array so that splicing does not affect subsequent indexes.
  
- Consolidate removal loops where possible.  
  • You can create a single loop where multiple conditions (i.e., removal of "Sales" and "NA") are checked, reducing duplicate iterations on the array.
  
- Add inline comments to highlight the importance of each array transformation step.  
  • This improves maintainability and ease of understanding for any future developer.
  
- Instead of using magic numbers (e.g., splicing exactly the first two elements or popping the last element when count > 2), consider defining constants or adding comments to explain the rationale behind these decisions.
  
- Use temporary variables to hold frequently used values, which can make the code more readable and easier to maintain.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ownership & Testing:**  
  • Ensure that unit tests cover various scenarios including normal, edge conditions, and invalid inputs.  
  • Assign a team member or set up tag testing environments to validate changes, especially after modifying any array manipulation logic.

- **Documentation:**  
  • Keep the documentation updated with any code changes.  
  • Include version history and change logs in the extension properties section if possible.

- **Monitoring:**  
  • Monitor the GA4 reports to ensure that the virtual event titles are captured correctly.  
  • Log changes or errors from this extension, possibly by introducing a simple logging mechanism (if ES5 compliant) to capture processing errors.

- **Integration with Other Extensions:**  
  • Review the order of execution in Tealium iQ and ensure that this extension’s scope (After Load Rules) is not conflicted by other similar modifications to the GA4VirtualEventTitle.

By following these guidelines and recommendations, developers can ensure that the GA4 : Set GA4EventTitle extension remains robust, maintainable, and adaptable to future requirements.
