# Appstore Redirect Extension Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive overview and detailed explanation of the Appstore Redirect extension for Tealium iQ. It covers key details such as configuration, logic flow, usage examples, known limitations, and suggestions for future improvements and maintenance.

---

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name**: Appstore Redirect  
- **Extension ID**: 1701  
- **Library Extension ID**: 100036 (as referenced in configuration metadata)  
- **Type**: Javascript Code  
- **Scope**: After Tag Extensions  
- **Occurrence / Execution Frequency**: Run Once

**Summary:**  
The Appstore Redirect extension is designed to detect if users are accessing specific app page URLs and then conditionally redirect them to the appropriate mobile app store (Google Play for Android and Apple App Store for iOS) based on the detected user agent or URL parameters. The extension works by searching specific DOM elements for corresponding app store links or by making use of data provided via the `utag_data` object. It also preserves certain query string parameters during the redirection.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables and Objects

- **testLogging**  
  - A boolean flag (defaulted to `false`) that can be toggled for debugging purposes. When enabled, the code displays alerts to assist with debugging.

- **appStoreRedirect Object**  
  - Contains sub-objects, properties, and methods that encapsulate the redirection logic.

#### Properties:
- **appStoreDomains**  
  - An object mapping brand names (google and apple) to the corresponding domain names:
    - `google`: `"play.google.com"`
    - `apple`: `"apps.apple.com"`

- **immutableParameters**  
  - An array of query parameter names (`["id", "mt"]`) that should not be modified during the redirection.

#### Methods:
- **getElements(selector)**  
  - Returns an array of DOM elements matching the CSS selector provided.

- **domainToSelector(domain)**  
  - Constructs a CSS selector string to locate anchor (`<a>`) elements within a page that link to a specified domain. It handles variations of container classes (using `div#main` and `div.main`).

- **getLinks(brand)**  
  - Based on the brand provided (case-insensitive), this method gathers potential redirect links by:
    - First checking if there exists a dynamic URL value in `window.utag_data` (using the key `AppStoreRedirect<brand>`).
    - Then, retrieving links from the page DOM that match the constructed selector based on the brand's domain.
  - Returns an array of the `href` attribute values of these links.

- **deconstructUrl(_url)**  
  - Normalises and deconstructs a given URL. Handles protocol-relative URLs (`//`) and relative URLs (`/`), converting them to absolute URLs.
  - Splits the URL into several components:
    - `protocol`
    - `hostname`
    - `pathname`
    - `queryparts`: An object mapping query parameter keys to their values.
  - Provides an additional `href()` method that rebuilds the URL string from its parts.

- **getEnrichedLink(brand)**  
  - Retrieves the first available link for the given brand using `getLinks` and enriches it by:
    - Deconstructing both the selected link and the current page URL.
    - Merging query parameters from the current URL into the link’s query parts (excluding immutable parameters).
  - Returns the reconstructed enriched URL using the `href()` method from the deconstructed link object.

- **getBrand()**  
  - Determines the user’s device brand by:
    - Inspecting the `window.navigator.userAgent` string for identifiers such as "Android", "iPhone", or "iPad".
    - Checking URL parameters (`forceandroid` or `forceapple`) in `window.location.search` to override user agent analysis.
  - Returns either "Google" or "Apple" depending on the detected device.

- **getRedirect()**  
  - Uses `getBrand` to determine the user’s device and then retrieves the enriched redirect URL by using `getEnrichedLink` accordingly.
  - Returns the appropriate URL for redirection.

- **doRedirect()**  
  - Orchestrates the redirection process:
    - Calls `getRedirect()` to retrieve the target URL.
    - If a valid URL is returned, sets `window.location.href` to initiate the redirection.
    - Utilises `testLogging` to optionally alert debugging information.

### Execution Flow

1. **Initial Condition Checks:**  
   At the bottom of the code, there are conditionals that check the current URL (`window.location.href` or `window.location.pathname`) for specific paths or patterns. For example:
   - Redirect is triggered if the URL contains `'scottishwidows.co.uk/app.html'`.
   - Additionally, checks are done for paths like `"/smart-id-digital-identity-app/download.html"` and `"/our-app/download.html"`.
   - Other potential targets are commented out, allowing for easy adjustment of which sites should be included in the redirection logic.

2. **Device/Brand Detection:**  
   The `getBrand()` function examines the browser's user agent string and URL parameters to determine the operating system (Google for Android devices and Apple for iPhones and iPads).

3. **URL Enrichment:**  
   Once a target brand is identified, `getEnrichedLink()` gathers the appropriate link and enriches it by merging in current page query parameters (excluding immutable parameters).

4. **Redirection:**  
   If an enriched URL is determined, the `doRedirect()` function updates `window.location.href` to begin the redirection.

### Dependencies on Global Objects

- **window.location**:  
  Used to determine the current URL and to trigger the redirection by updating `href`.

- **window.navigator.userAgent**:  
  For detecting the type of device (Android/iOS).

- **window.utag_data**:  
  Optionally provides externally specified app store links via keys in the format `AppStoreRedirect<Brand>`.

- **document.querySelectorAll**:  
  Used to locate DOM elements that may contain the store links.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Typical Scenario (Normal Conditions)

1. A user visits a page (e.g. `'scottishwidows.co.uk/app.html'`).
2. The extension is activated because the URL matches one of the conditions.
3. `getBrand()` inspects the user agent and determines that the user is on an Android device.
4. `getEnrichedLink("Google")` is invoked:
   - If `window.utag_data` contains a key `AppStoreRedirectGoogle`, that link is used.
   - Otherwise, the extension searches the DOM for an `<a>` element with an href containing `"play.google.com"`.
5. Existing query parameters (except for `"id"` and `"mt"`) from the current URL are carried over to the target URL.
6. The user is redirected to the enriched Google Play Store URL.

### Edge Scenario (Missing Link)

- **No Available App Store Link:**  
  - If none of the conditions in `getLinks` find a valid store link and there is no value in the `utag_data` object, the function returns `undefined` and no redirection occurs.
  
- **Relative or Protocol-Relative URLs:**  
  - The `deconstructUrl` function normalises URLs that are protocol-relative (starting with `//`) or relative (starting with `/`). This ensures that even if the link does not start with `https://`, it is converted into an absolute URL before processing.

### Logging (Debug Mode)

- By setting `testLogging` to `true`, developers can see alerts that display the detection steps like the computed brand and the final enriched URL. This is particularly useful for troubleshooting during development.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Dependence on DOM Structure:**  
  - The functions rely on specific container structures (`div#main`, `div.main`) and the presence of `<a>` tags with the correct href format. Changes to the DOM structure may cause the selector-based functions to fail in finding valid links.
  
- **Query Parameter Merging:**  
  - Only query parameters not listed in `immutableParameters` are merged from the original URL to the target URL. If the target URL already includes any parameter that should be updated, the logic will simply overwrite the existing value.
  
- **User Agent Detection Limitations:**  
  - The user agent string might not be reliable in all cases, especially for less common devices or if the user agent is manipulated. There is also a dependence on specific substrings ("Android", "iPhone", "iPad") which may not cover all scenarios.
  
- **Global State & External Dependencies:**  
  - The extension assumes that `window.utag_data` exists and has the correct values when needed. If this object is not properly initialised, the extension might not function as intended.
  
- **Potential Conflicts:**  
  - As the extension runs in the "After Tag Extensions" scope, it could potentially conflict with other Tealium extensions or external scripts that modify the document structure or `window.location` behaviour.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks and Error Handling:**  
  - Although the assumption is that `eventType` (string) and `eventPayload` (object) are always available in other parts of the system, consider adding checks for DOM element existence. This helps prevent script errors if the expected elements are missing.
  
- **Modularisation:**  
  - Consider breaking the large `appStoreRedirect` object into smaller, more focused modules (e.g. URL processing, DOM manipulation, and redirection logic). This would improve readability and ease future maintenance.
  
- **Comments and Documentation Inline:**  
  - While the code is moderately commented, adding detailed inline comments for complex sections (e.g. the logic in `deconstructUrl` and `getEnrichedLink`) would facilitate maintenance.
  
- **Code Style:**  
  - Ensure consistency in naming conventions and spacing according to team guidelines. Even though ES6 features are not allowed (ES5 compatibility is required), use clear and consistent function expressions.
  
- **Testing Enhancements:**  
  - Create unit tests for each method, particularly for edge cases in `deconstructUrl` and `getEnrichedLink`, ensuring that unexpected URL formats are correctly handled.
  
- **Simplifying Query Parameter Handling:**  
  - The logic to merge query parameters in `getEnrichedLink` could be refactored to a dedicated helper function. This would encapsulate the merging logic and potentially support more complex scenarios in the future.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**
  - **Ownership:** Clearly designate team members responsible for this extension’s maintenance. Create detailed commit messages and code reviews when changes are made.
  - **Testing:**  
    - Use both manual testing (via testLogging mode) and automated tests to validate redirection behaviours.
    - Regularly test on various devices and browsers to ensure consistent behaviour across user agents.
  - **Documentation Updates:**  
    - Update this documentation alongside any code changes to ensure developers and stakeholders are aware of current logic and any potential impacts.
  
- **Future Enhancements:**
  - Consider implementing feature flags or configuration options that can be managed via Tealium to dynamically adjust conditions or redirection URLs without code deployment.
  - Monitor any changes to the targeted websites’ layout or link structures and update the DOM selectors accordingly.
  
- **Code Reviews and Refactoring Sessions:**  
  - Establish a periodic review cycle to ensure that the extension remains compatible with updates in both Tealium and the browsers it supports. Periodic refactoring sessions can further simplify and improve the robustness of the code.
