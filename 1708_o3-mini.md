# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation – Dummy DCSAUT value

This document provides an in-depth explanation of the "Dummy DCSAUT value" extension used in Tealium iQ. It covers the extension overview, code explanation, usage examples, known limitations, refactoring recommendations, and maintenance notes.

---

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Dummy DCSAUT value  
- **Extension ID:** 1708  
- **Tealium iQ Extension Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** 928  
- **Execution Frequency:**  
  - The extension executes on every relevant tag firing based on the associated load rules (its conditions array is empty, implying the code runs for all events unless overridden by other rules).

**Summary:**  
This extension ensures that the property `RetailCustomerID` on the event payload (object `eventPayload`) is always defined. If it is not already set, the code assigns a default value of `"-"`. This is useful for data consistency, ensuring that even if a Retail Customer ID is absent, the property is still populated with a known string, which downstream systems may rely on when processing the data.

## 2. Code Explanation

Below is the annotated version of the extension code:

```javascript
// {
//   "conditions": [],
//   "extensionId": 100036,
//   "extensionType": "Javascript Code",
//   "id": 1708,
//   "library": null,
//   "loadRule": null,
//   "name": "Dummy DCSAUT value",
//   "notes": null,
//   "occurrence": null,
//   "scope": "928",
//   "status": "active"
// }

(function(a, b, u) {
    // a: eventType (string), guaranteed by Tealium
    // b: eventPayload (object), guaranteed by Tealium
    // u: tagObject (object) - additional meta-data or tag configuration if needed

    // Check if RetailCustomerID is falsy (undefined, null, or any falsy value)
    if (!b.RetailCustomerID) {
        // Set to default value "-" if property is not set
        b.RetailCustomerID = "-";
    }
})(eventType, eventPayload, tagObject);
```

### Key Variables:
- **a (eventType):** The string representing the type of event being processed.  
- **b (eventPayload):** An object that holds event data including the potential RetailCustomerID.  
- **u (tagObject):** An object containing additional data about the tag execution.

### Logic Flow:
1. The code is wrapped in an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) that takes three parameters (`a`, `b`, `u`).
2. It checks whether the property `RetailCustomerID` exists on the `eventPayload` object (`b`).
3. If `RetailCustomerID` is not set (i.e., is falsy), it assigns the value `"-"` to ensure consistency in data.

### Dependencies:
- The extension relies on the global objects/variables `eventType`, `eventPayload`, and `tagObject` as provided by Tealium.
- No external libraries are used in this extension.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Scenario:
- **Input:**  
  The event payload might be:  
  `{ "event_name": "purchase", "RetailCustomerID": "ABC123" }`
  
- **Behaviour:**  
  The code checks for `RetailCustomerID` and finds the value `"ABC123"`.  
- **Output:**  
  The event payload remains unchanged:  
  `{ "event_name": "purchase", "RetailCustomerID": "ABC123" }`

### Edge Condition – Missing RetailCustomerID:
- **Input:**  
  The event payload might be:  
  `{ "event_name": "purchase" }`
  
- **Behaviour:**  
  The property `RetailCustomerID` is missing (or falsy). The code will assign it the default value `"-"`.  
- **Output:**  
  The event payload becomes:  
  `{ "event_name": "purchase", "RetailCustomerID": "-" }`

### Edge Condition – Null or Empty Value:
- **Input:**  
  `{ "event_name": "purchase", "RetailCustomerID": null }` or `{ "RetailCustomerID": "" }`
  
- **Behaviour:**  
  Both `null` and `""` are falsy; therefore, the extension will replace them with `"-"`.  
- **Output:**  
  `{ "event_name": "purchase", "RetailCustomerID": "-" }`

---

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Falsy Checks:**  
  The current check uses a simple falsy evaluation (`if (!b.RetailCustomerID)`), which means valid values that are falsy (e.g. numeric 0) would be overwritten. If a 0 is ever a valid RetailCustomerID, additional logic will be needed.

- **Global Object Dependencies:**  
  The extension depends on `eventType`, `eventPayload`, and `tagObject` being available in the global scope as guaranteed by Tealium. Any change in how these objects are provided may lead to unexpected behaviour.

- **Interaction with Other Extensions:**  
  This extension should run prior to any extension needing the `RetailCustomerID` field. If another extension depends on the default value or modifies it after this extension runs, conflicts may arise.

- **Non-availability of Defensive Checks for Parameter Existence:**  
  Although the guarantee exists, in unusual scenarios where Tealium’s variables might be manipulated, there is no fallback mechanism for missing global objects.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Coding Enhancements:**  
  While the requirement states that `eventType` and `eventPayload` are guaranteed to be present, you might consider documenting the assumption clearly in comments. Adding extra telemetry or logging could help in debugging production issues if misuse is suspected.

- **Code Styling & Modularity:**  
  - Use clear variable names where possible, for example, renaming `a`, `b`, and `u` to more descriptive names (this can be included in inline comments given the ES5 constraint).
  - Consider abstracting the default assignment logic into a helper function if similar checks are required elsewhere in your tag management solution.

- **Error Handling:**  
  Although not required here, it might be beneficial in more complex extensions to incorporate try-catch blocks where there's a risk of runtime errors. However, given the simplicity of this extension and ES5 support, this is optional.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**
  - Ensure that any future modifications or additional validations maintain backward compatibility with ES5.
  - Regularly review the interactions between this extension and others that may affect the `RetailCustomerID` property.
  - Maintain a version history and changelog within comments for future developers reviewing the code.

- **Ownership:**
  - Assign a specific team or individual as the owner of this extension; document the owner’s contact details within supplementary documentation.
  
- **Testing Guidelines:**
  - Include unit tests that simulate different states of `eventPayload` (with and without the `RetailCustomerID` property).
  - Test integration within Tealium’s environment by simulating events that pass through this extension to ensure that edge cases are correctly handled.
  - Monitor data consistency in the downstream systems that consume the event payload.

- **Documentation Updates:**
  - Update this documentation alongside modifications to the extension code.
  - Ensure that all stakeholders have access to the current version of the documentation, particularly when changes in business requirements necessitate adjustments.
