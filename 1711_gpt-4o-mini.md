# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation

## 1. Extension Overview
- **Name:** Media Queries Preferences
- **ID:** 1711
- **Type:** Javascript Code
- **Scope:** After Load Rules
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Always

### Summary
This extension is designed to assess user preferences based on media queries such as color schemes, motion reduction settings, and display modes. It captures various user preferences by evaluating the supported media queries in the browser. The collected data is then appended to the `TaggingMechanics` variable, enabling better targeting for marketing and analytics purposes.

---

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- **mediaQueries:** An array of arrays defining the media query conditions and their corresponding tagging keys.
- **tm (TaggingMechanics):** A variable that pulls current tagging mechanics from a global object (if available) and appends the results of the media query matches.

### Logic Flow
1. **Initial Setup:** The `mediaQueries` array defines multiple conditions relating to user preferences, such as `prefers-color-scheme` and orientation.
2. **Retrieve Current Tagging Mechanics:** It retrieves existing tagging mechanics from the `TaggingMechanics` global object and splits it into an array of strings.
3. **Evaluate Media Queries:** For each media query in the `mediaQueries` array, the code checks if the conditions match using `window.matchMedia()`. If a match is found, the associated key is included in the `tm` array.
4. **Support for CSS Nesting:** It checks for support of nested CSS selectors and appends a corresponding tag if supported.
5. **Update Global Tagging Mechanics:** Finally, the results are joined into a comma-separated string and assigned back to the global `TaggingMechanics`.

### Dependencies
- **Global Objects:** 
  - `window`: Used for evaluating media queries.
  - `CSS`: Used to check for support of the CSS selector feature.
- **Assumed Libraries:** The extension assumes the presence of a `TaggingMechanics` global variable.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Operation
When the extension executes:
- If the user prefers a dark color scheme, the tagging mechanic `pcs_d` is added.
- For a user on a mobile device who prefers reduced motion, the tagging mechanic `prm` is appended.

The resulting `TaggingMechanics` string might look like: `pcs_d, pc_l, prm`.

### Edge Conditions
- **Unsupported Media Queries:** If a browser doesn't support a specific media feature, the code catches the exception silently and continues execution without interruptions.
- **No Media Query Matches:** In scenarios where none of the media queries match, `TaggingMechanics` will revert to just its original state.

---

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas
- **Browser Compatibility:** Users on older browsers may not have full support for certain media queries, which may result in incomplete tagging mechanics.
- **Execution Timing:** If the extension does not execute after all loading rules, it may not capture user preferences correctly.
- **Conflicts:** Other extensions manipulating the `TaggingMechanics` global variable may create conflicts, leading to unexpected results.

---

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring
- **Defensive Coding:** While eventType and eventPayload are guaranteed, ensure clarity in variable declarations and error handling. Current error handling suppresses exceptions; consider logging errors for easier debugging.
- **Modularisation:** It might be beneficial to separate the media query evaluations into a dedicated function for better readability and maintenance.
- **Documentation:** Include inline comments documenting the purpose of various sections within the code, particularly for the media queries and logic flow.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes
- **Ownership:** Assign a team member to take on ownership of the extension for ongoing updates and improvements.
- **Testing Guidelines:** Conduct regular testing across different browsers and devices to ensure continued functionality, especially after major updates of Tealium.
- **Documentation Updates:** Keep this document updated with any changes made to the extension to ensure all team members are aware of its current state and functionality.
