# Media Queries Preferences Extension Documentation

This document details the purpose, inner workings, usage, limitations, recommendations, and maintenance guidelines for the "Media Queries Preferences" extension.

---

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Media Queries Preferences  
- **Extension ID:** 1711 (within extension configuration metadata)  
- **Extension Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** After Load Rules  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Always

**Summary:**  
This extension is designed to detect a variety of browser media query settings and append corresponding shorthand flags to a comma-separated string called TaggingMechanics. The extension starts with any existing TaggingMechanics, performs media query matches (e.g. dark/light theme, reduced motion, orientation, display mode, pointer type, etc.) using the browser’s `window.matchMedia` function, and finally appends an additional flag if the browser supports CSS nesting via `CSS.supports`. The result is stored back into the eventPayload, making these flags available for further logic within the Tealium ecosystem.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables and Structures

- **mediaQueries Array:**  
  A list of arrays where each sub-array contains three values:
  - A shorthand identifier (e.g. "pcs_d" for dark colour scheme).
  - The corresponding media query feature (e.g. "prefers-color-scheme").
  - The expected value for a match (e.g. "dark").

- **tm Variable:**  
  Holds the initial TaggingMechanics value found in the eventPayload.  
  - The value is split by commas into an array.
  - After processing the media queries, additional flags are concatenated.

### Logic Flow

1. **Initial Setup:**  
   The code is wrapped in an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) that takes two parameters: `eventType` and `eventPayload`. These correspond to the current event type and its associated data.

2. **Media Query Matching:**  
   - The `mediaQueries` array defines several media query checks.
   - The code performs a `.map()` over the array. For each media query:
     - A try-catch block is used to safely call `window.matchMedia` with a media feature and value (e.g. `"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"`).
     - If the media query matches the current browser’s settings, the shorthand identifier (the first item in the sub-array) is returned.
     - If an error occurs (e.g. if the media query feature is not recognised), the error is silently caught.

3. **Building the TaggingMechanics List:**  
   - The new identifiers are concatenated with the initial TaggingMechanics array.
   - A filter is applied to remove any falsey values (empty strings, `undefined`, or `false`).

4. **CSS Feature Check:**  
   - A try-catch block tests whether the browser supports the nesting selector using `CSS.supports("selector(&)")`.
   - If the check passes, the identifier `"css_nest"` is appended to the TaggingMechanics array.

5. **Final Assignment:**  
   - The array is joined back into a comma-separated string.
   - The updated string is then assigned back to the `TaggingMechanics` attribute of `eventPayload`.

### Dependencies on Global Objects or Libraries

- **window.matchMedia:**  
  Used to evaluate CSS media queries in the browser.
  
- **CSS.supports:**  
  Utilised to check for support of CSS features (selector nesting in this case).

- **eventType and eventPayload:**  
  These are provided by Tealium as part of the extension runtime context.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Scenario

1. **Input:**  
   - A browser where `prefers-color-scheme: dark` is active and the other media queries return false.  
   - The `eventPayload.TaggingMechanics` string might initially be `"initialized"`.

2. **Process:**  
   - The media query for `"prefers-color-scheme: dark"` matches, so `"pcs_d"` is added.
   - All the other queries return false (or are not a match).
   - If CSS supports the nesting selector, `"css_nest"` is also added.

3. **Output:**  
   The final TaggingMechanics might be:  
   `"initialized,pcs_d,css_nest"`

### Edge Case Scenario

1. **Input:**  
   - A browser with some unknown or unsupported media query features.
   - A pre-existing TaggingMechanics string, for example `"base"`.
  
2. **Process:**  
   - Some calls to `window.matchMedia` may throw errors which are caught silently.
   - No additional shorthand might be appended if none of the queries match.
   - Even if errors occur, the code still attempts to push `"css_nest"` based on the supported feature check.

3. **Output:**  
   - If no media query matches and no errors are critical, the final TaggingMechanics might remain `"base,css_nest"` (assuming the CSS nesting check passes).

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Silent Failure on Media Query Errors:**  
  The try-catch within the media query mapping can mask issues. Any error during `window.matchMedia` evaluation results in a silent failure, which might make debugging more challenging.

- **CSS.supports Compatibility:**  
  The check for `"selector(&)"` may not behave uniformly across all browsers. In older browsers or those without CSS.supports support, this block will fail silently.

- **Potential Conflicts:**  
  - If other Tealium extensions modify the `TaggingMechanics` value, the concatenation might result in duplicate or misordered identifiers.
  - Extensions or scripts modifying global CSS or media query behaviour can lead to unexpected results.

- **Ordering and Concatenation:**  
  The order of identifiers is determined first by the initial `TaggingMechanics` and then by the order of appearance in the mediaQueries array. This might affect any subsequent logic that depends on the ordering.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Error Logging:**  
  Consider adding logging within catch blocks (where appropriate) to capture errors for troubleshooting. This may help identify issues with specific media query evaluations without altering flow for production.

- **Modularisation:**  
  Break the code into smaller helper functions (e.g. one for processing media queries, one for CSS feature check) to improve readability and maintainability. (Note: Ensure that any refactored code continues to support ES5.)

- **Code Comments:**  
  Although the current code is relatively straightforward, additional inline comments explaining the purpose of key operations could help future developers.

- **Avoiding Silent Failures:**  
  If feasible, provide a fallback or log for cases where a media query check fails unexpectedly. This might aid in debugging and routine monitoring in production environments.

- **Testing on Multiple Browsers:**  
  Given different browser behaviours regarding media queries and CSS.supports, it is recommended to test the extension across all supported environments to ensure consistency.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  - Regularly check for updates in browser support for media queries and CSS features to adjust the code accordingly.
  - Monitor browser analytics to determine which media query conditions are most frequently matched, and update the `mediaQueries` list if necessary.

- **Ownership and Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Assign a dedicated team member or maintain a repository of tests (preferably using a cross-browser testing tool) to verify the extension's operation across new browser versions.
  - Include unit tests that simulate various media query match scenarios to ensure future changes do not break existing functionality.

- **Documentation Updates:**  
  Update this documentation as enhancements are made or if the underlying logic is refactored. Include version notes where applicable.

- **Dependency Monitoring:**  
  Should Tealium's capabilities evolve or if global functions like `window.matchMedia` or `CSS.supports` change, schedule a periodic review of the extension to ensure compatibility.
