# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: SCEP Integration POC

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name**: SCEP Integration POC
- **ID**: 100036
- **Type**: Javascript Code
- **Scope**: DOM Ready
- **Execution Frequency**: Run Once

**Summary**:  
The SCEP Integration POC extension is designed to enhance data tracking for an interactive postcode finder. It allows for detailed tracking of user interactions within the postcode finder interface, including user input, clicks on buttons, and visibility of elements. The primary goal is to capture meaningful analytics data to evaluate user engagement and streamline the user experience. This data is then sent to the LBG Analytics platform.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- **`verboseLogging`**: A boolean flag to indicate whether detailed logs should be output.
- **`scepAnalytics`**: The main object managing tracking functionalities.
- **`formModel`**: An object holding the values of form fields.
- **`trackedElements`**: An array to store elements that are being tracked by the extension.
- **`formSendSelectors`**: An array defining selectors for elements that will trigger form submissions.

### Logic Flow
1. **Initialization**: The extension checks for the existence of the `LBGAnalytics` object. If present, it initializes the tracking functionalities.
2. **Event Tracking**: The extension has functions to track various user interactions.
    - **`trackPostcodeFinder`**: Captures interactions with the postcode finder.
    - **`trackFormFields`**: Monitors changes in form fields and gathers data.
    - **`trackRangeSlider`**: Tracks input from range sliders and their interactions with buttons to increase or decrease values.
3. **Data Handling**: When a user interacts with components, data is stored and sent via the `trackEvent` function to the LBG Analytics system.
4. **Visibility Tracking**: Uses `IntersectionObserver` to capture when elements enter the viewport.

### Dependencies
- **Global Objects**: Relies on the global `LBGAnalytics` object for sending tracking data.
- **Browser Features**: Utilizes `IntersectionObserver` for visibility tracking, requiring modern browsers.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Scenario
- When a user enters a postcode into the postcode finder and clicks the search button, the extension:
  1. Captures the input value and sends a field update event.
  2. Logs the interaction events such as "Engaged" and "Search Click" to LBGAnalytics.

### Edge Condition
- If a user interacts with the postcode finder elements before they are fully loaded, the code checks for the existence of the elements before binding event listeners. If an element is missing, a log entry that notes "No postcode container found" will be generated, avoiding any script errors.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Browser Support for IntersectionObserver**: If the user's browser does not support `IntersectionObserver`, the extension will not track visibility correctly. This is handled by falling back to immediate callback execution.
  
- **Dependency on Specific Markup**: The selectors used (e.g., `input#postcodelookup`, `.c-117-slider`) depend on the presence of specific HTML structure. Any changes in the structure could break the functionality.

- **Event Handling Duplication**: If an element is already handled (`LBGAhandled`), it will not be tracked again, which could cause some interactions to be missed if the logic for handling is changed.

---

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Coding**: Although it's guaranteed that `eventType` and `eventPayload` will be present, consider adding checks (e.g., exists, type) before accessing properties to avoid runtime exceptions.

- **Modularization**: Break down the code into smaller, reusable functions. This can improve readability, maintainability, and reusability of tracking logic.

- **Consistent Logging**: The logging function should consistently format log entries for easier debugging. Consider implementing structured logging.

- **Code Comments**: Enhance inline comments to clarify complex sections or logic flows for future developers.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ownership**: Designate a primary owner for the extension to ensure consistent updates and troubleshooting.

- **Testing Guidelines**: Regularly test in various browsers and devices to ensure functionality remains intact. Automated tests could be considered to verify critical functionality.

- **Documentation Updates**: Revisit and update documentation whenever changes are made to the extension's logic or structure, ensuring accuracy for stakeholders and future developers.

This comprehensive documentation aims to provide clarity regarding the SCEP Integration POC extension, ensuring that current and future developers can efficiently engage with and maintain the code.
