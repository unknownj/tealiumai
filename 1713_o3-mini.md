## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** SCEP Integration POC  
- **Extension ID:** 100036  
- **Extension Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** DOM Ready  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Once (occurrence)

**Summary:**  
The SCEP Integration POC extension is designed to integrate analytics tracking into various page components, including postcode lookup, range sliders, form fields, accordions, and tool tips. It utilises the global LBGAnalytics object to send events and correlation data. The extension is built to work on the DOM Ready event and is deployed to run once, ensuring that component interactions are tracked appropriately and events are sent to the LBGA API. Logging functionality is provided when verbose logging is enabled, which aids in debugging and monitoring of events and interactions.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables & Structures

- **Global Dependency:**  
  The extension relies on the global object `LBGAnalytics`. If this object is not present, the code terminates without executing further.

- **scepAnalytics Object:**  
  This is the main object encapsulating all functions and properties for analytics tracking:
  - **verboseLogging:** A flag that determines whether logs are output via `console.log()`.
  - **log:** A helper function that outputs logs if `verboseLogging` is true.
  - **trackEvent:** A function that sends an event payload to the LBGA API using `LBGAnalytics.events.send()`.
  - **formModel:** An object used for storing form input values.
  - **trackedElements:** An array used to keep track of all elements that have been processed by the extension.
  - **querySelectorAll:** A helper function to resolve selectors and return an array of element references.
  
- **events:**  
  An enum-like object that maps various event names (such as "FieldUpdate", "DwellTime", "Occurred", "Seen", etc.) to their corresponding numeric or string identifiers used by Adobe Analytics.

### Core Functions & Logic Flow

- **enableLogging / log:**  
  Functions to enable and output logs for debugging purposes. Logging is conditional based on the `verboseLogging` flag.

- **trackEvent:**  
  Takes a payload and, if LBGAnalytics is available, sends the event via the LBGA events API. It also logs the payload if verbose logging is enabled.

- **trackMicroConversion:**  
  Tracks micro conversion events by adding correlations with an event number. It uses `scepAnalytics.events` values to signal various milestones (e.g. "Occurred", "Loaded", "Seen", etc.).

- **resolveSelectorToElement:**  
  A utility function that accepts a selector string, an Element, or an Array and returns the corresponding DOM element. This helps ensure that all operations are performed on valid elements.

- **trackVisibility:**  
  A derived function for tracking when an element becomes visible within the viewport. It uses the `IntersectionObserver` API if available, and otherwise immediately calls the given callback.

- **trackPostcodeFinder:**  
  Adds analytics integration for the postcode lookup component:
  - Resolves constituent elements such as root container, input, search button, manual entry, and the address list.
  - Sets up event listeners for keyup on the postcode input, click events on the search button, manual entry button, and result list.
  - Tracks micro conversions (25% Done, 50% Done, 75% Done, Completed, etc.) based on user interactions and logs usage events using `LBGAnalytics.events.fieldUpdate` and `trackEvent`.

- **trackRangeSlider:**  
  Attaches event listeners to range slider inputs to track input changes:
  - Validates that the element is indeed a range slider.
  - Resolves a target input field that the slider is bound to.
  - Tracks change events on the slider and additionally increments/decrements actions using sibling arrow elements.
  - Uses a count limit on events to prevent excessive triggers.

- **pageIsTranslated:**  
  A simple check that assesses whether the page's language is set to something other than English.

- **getDirectTextChildren:**  
  This function extracts and cleans text nodes from an element, filtering out whitespace and any text if the page is in a translated language.

- **trackFormSubmits & trackFormFields:**  
  Functions to capture events from form submissions and form field interactions:
  - **trackFormSubmits:** Attaches click event listeners to specified selectors (using `formSendSelectors`) and logs form field values.
  - **trackFormFields:** Attaches focus, blur, and change event listeners to form elements ensuring that field updates are sent with their name, value, and any error text. It also prevents duplicate handling if an element has been processed already.

- **trackAccordions & trackToolTips:**  
  Functions that add event listeners to accordion components and tool tip containers to capture and send interaction events when a user clicks on these elements.

- **populateCalculatorJourneyName:**  
  Reads an attribute (`calc-id`) from the calculator component and sets a corresponding "JourneyName" value in the LBGAnalytics datalayer.

- **init:**  
  The entry point for the extension, which:
  - Enables logging if requested.
  - Calls tracking functions for postcode finder, range slider, accordions, tool tips, form fields, and submit buttons.
  - Invokes the population of the journey name.

### Dependencies

- **LBGAnalytics:**  
  All event tracking is dependent on `LBGAnalytics`. This global object must provide the `events` and `correlations` APIs as well as a datalayer interface.
  
- **Browser APIs:**  
  Uses standard DOM methods and the `IntersectionObserver` API (with a fallback) for element visibility tracking.

- **DOM Structure:**  
  The extension assumes a certain structure in the DOM (e.g. specific selectors for postcode lookup, range sliders, form fields, etc.). Correct functionality is reliant on these elements being present and correctly marked up.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Example Scenario: Postcode Lookup Interaction

1. **Initialisation:**  
   - The DOM becomes ready, and the extension initialises.
   - The postcode finder element (`#postcodelookupsection`) is detected.
   
2. **User Interaction:**
   - The user types into the postcode input field.  
     - A keyup event is fired.
     - The extension captures the input and tracks the first interaction (engagement and 50% done state).
   - The user clicks on the search button.  
     - The click triggers an event that logs the search click and increments the count.
     - For the first click, it also tracks a 75% done micro conversion.
   - Alternatively, if the manual entry button is clicked before any search, the extension tracks it as a cancellation (and possibly a skip if there was no input).

3. **Result Selection:**
   - The user clicks on a list item from the address list.
   - The extension checks that the target is a list item, tracks a completed micro conversion and sends an event update.

### Example Scenario: Range Slider Interaction

1. **Initialisation:**  
   - During initial execution, the extension attaches event listeners to any input element of type "range" with a corresponding target input.
   
2. **User Interaction:**
   - The user adjusts the range slider.
   - A change event is fired:
     - The extension checks that the change is valid (not duplicate or default) and within a capped event count.
     - It logs the change and sends a "FieldUpdateByRangeSlider" event.
   - The arrow buttons linked to the range slider allow for incremental changes.  
     - Clicking these triggers the "FieldUpdateByUpDownButton" event.

### Edge Conditions

- **Missing Elements:**  
  - If essential elements (e.g. postcode container, target input for range slider) cannot be found, the extension logs an error and returns early.
- **Browser Compatibility:**  
  - On browsers that do not support the `IntersectionObserver` API, the extension falls back by immediately executing the callback.
- **Form Fields:**  
  - If a form field has already been handled by another routine (flag `LBGAhandled`), no additional event listeners are attached.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **DOM Dependency:**  
  The extension requires a specific DOM structure. If the expected selectors do not exist or differ due to redesign, tracking may fail.
  
- **Global Object Dependency:**  
  The extension is entirely dependent on `LBGAnalytics`. If for any reason this object is not available or its API changes, no analytics events will be processed.

- **Browser Support:**  
  While the fallback for `IntersectionObserver` is provided, some older browsers may still have issues if other modern JavaScript features are not polyfilled or available.

- **Event Throttling:**  
  For elements like range sliders and arrow buttons, event counts are limited. In high-frequency interaction scenarios, some events may be deliberately ignored to avoid sending redundant data.

- **Potential Conflicts:**  
  The use of global flags (e.g. `LBGAhandled`) and reliance on specific class names might conflict with other Tealium extensions or external scripts modifying the same elements.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Modularisation:**  
  Consider splitting the monolithic `scepAnalytics` object into smaller, distinct modules or separate functions. For example, separate modules for form handling, range slider tracking, and component visibility tracking.

- **Defensive Checks:**  
  Although the code contains checks for element existence, additional validations in key functions (such as ensuring that required attributes are present) could be beneficial.

- **Event Listener Management:**  
  Investigate the possibility of removing event listeners after use to avoid memory leaks, especially in dynamic page environments.

- **Code Documentation:**  
  Add further inline comments and JSDoc annotations to assist in future debugging and refactoring efforts.

- **Consistent Coding Style:**  
  Maintain a consistent use of indentation and naming conventions. Given the ES5 requirement, ensure that all function expressions and variable declarations consistently use `var` and normal function syntax.

- **Testing and Debugging:**  
  Continue utilising the `verboseLogging` flag during debugging, and consider developing a set of unit tests around the core helper functions (where feasible within the ES5 constraints).

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  - Assign responsibility for tracking updates to the LBGAnalytics API.  
  - Monitor for any DOM structure changes in the host environment that could affect selector resolutions.
  - Regularly test the extension in all supported browsers, with a focus on older browsers given the ES5 requirement.

- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Perform regression tests especially after any changes to the page layout or the global analytics objects.
  - Utilize verbose logging during development and turn it off in production to minimise console noise.
  - Consider creating a test harness that simulates interactions on each tracked element to validate that events are correctly sent.

- **Ownership:**  
  - Clearly document the contact points or team responsible for the analytics tracking within the organisation.  
  - Maintain version control with detailed commit messages explaining any changes to the tracking mechanisms.

- **Further Documentation:**  
  - Keep this documentation up to date as changes are implemented.  
  - Establish a changelog for the extension to track improvements and bug fixes over time.
