## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Show Hide 2 Prototype  
- **Extension ID:** 100036  
- **Internal ID:** 1716  
- **Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** DOM Ready  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Once  

**Summary:**  
This extension is designed to interact with a specific page ("/bankaccounts/overdrafts/lloyds-cost-calculator.html") by setting a datalayer property, mapping an element’s text content to a new datalayer value ("JourneyAmount"), and triggering an event when an element identified by the instruction’s attributes is clicked. The code integrates data collection and event reporting using the global objects LBGAnalytics.datalayer and LBGAnalytics.events, thereby facilitating both user behaviour tracking and dynamic content mapping.

---

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables and Data Structures

- **analyticsIntegration:**  
  An array containing configuration objects. Each object defines:
  - The target element (via a string identifier such as "classic-layout").
  - The trigger condition ("show").
  - Mapping instructions to retrieve text content from a specific HTML element (`p[scep-template='##total-cost##']`) and assign it to a datalayer property ("JourneyAmount").
  - Additional datalayer properties that should be set (e.g. `JourneyProduct: "Classic"`).
  - Event details (e.g. event action "Select Account" and narrative "Classic").

- **handlers:**  
  An object with three methods:
  - **datalayer:** Accepts an object and calls `LBGAnalytics.datalayer.set` to update the datalayer.
  - **mapProperty:** Queries the DOM for the specified element; if found and the property exists, it creates an object and passes it to the datalayer handler.
  - **event:** Sends the event object via `LBGAnalytics.events.send`.

### Logic Flow

1. **Conditional Execution:**  
   The code first checks if the current page URL's pathname matches  
   `/bankaccounts/overdrafts/lloyds-cost-calculator.html`. All subsequent code only runs if this condition is met.

2. **Initial Datalayer Set:**  
   Calls `LBGAnalytics.datalayer.set` to set the property `Brand` with the value `"Lloyds"`. The third parameter (`true`) likely forces an immediate update.

3. **Processing Integration Instructions:**  
   - Filters the `analyticsIntegration` array to process only configuration objects where the `trigger` property equals `"show"`.
   - Attaches an event listener to the `document.body` for the `"click"` event.
  
4. **Event Listener Behaviour:**  
   - On every click, checks if the clicked element (target) contains a `data-show-elements` attribute.
   - Splits the attribute value by commas and checks if it includes the specific element identifier defined in the integration instruction.
   - If a match is found:
     - Executes `handlers.datalayer` to set additional datalayer properties.
     - Executes `handlers.mapProperty` to extract and map DOM element content to a datalayer property.
     - Executes `handlers.event` to send an event with the defined details.

### Dependencies on Global Objects/Libraries
- **LBGAnalytics.datalayer:**  
  Used for setting datalayer variables.
  
- **LBGAnalytics.events:**  
  Used for sending event data.  

- **DOM API:**  
  Utilises standard DOM methods such as `getAttribute`, `querySelector`, and `addEventListener`.

---

## 3. Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Standard Usage

- **Context:**  
  A user visits `/bankaccounts/overdrafts/lloyds-cost-calculator.html`.

- **Data Flow:**
  - The Brand is immediately set to `"Lloyds"` in the datalayer.
  - When the user clicks on an element (for example, a button) that has a `data-show-elements` attribute including `"classic-layout"`, the following occur:
    - The datalayer is updated with additional properties (`JourneyProduct: "Classic"`).
    - The code attempts to extract text content from an element matching the selector `p[scep-template='##total-cost##']`. If successful, this value is mapped to the `JourneyAmount` datalayer variable.
    - An event is triggered, sending the event details (`EventAction: "Select Account"`, `EventNarrative: "Classic"`) to the analytics backend.

### Scenario 2: Edge Conditions

- **Missing Element for Mapping:**  
  If the DOM query selector for `p[scep-template='##total-cost##']` does not find a match, the mapping procedure will be skipped. Although no explicit error handling is provided, the code quietly does nothing for that mapping case.

- **No Matching Data-Attribute:**  
  If the clicked element’s `data-show-elements` attribute does not include `"classic-layout"`, the event listener exits without triggering any datalayer update, mapping action, or event firing.

---

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Element Availability:**  
  The code heavily relies on the availability and correctness of the DOM elements selected using `querySelector`. If the element does not exist or the attribute values change, the mapping will fail.

- **Event Bubbling and Multiple Listeners:**  
  Using `document.body.addEventListener("click", ...)` causes every click on the page to trigger the event handler. If many such listeners exist, it could lead to performance issues or unintended behaviours if multiple extensions are active.

- **Data Attribute Format:**  
  The code expects `data-show-elements` to be a comma-separated string. Any deviation (e.g. spacing issues) might lead to failed lookups.

- **Global Dependencies:**  
  Dependencies on `LBGAnalytics.datalayer` and `LBGAnalytics.events` assume that these objects are already defined. If these libraries are not loaded or are overwritten by other scripts, the extension will not work as expected.

- **Trigger Condition Specificity:**  
  The event listener is only added for elements where `data-show-elements` includes `"classic-layout"`. If more instructions are added in the future, ensuring consistency in data attributes will become critical.

---

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks:**  
  While the code already verifies element existence via `document.querySelector`, consider adding more robust checks around the properties accessed on these elements (e.g. checking for null or undefined before property access).

- **Event Listener Optimisation:**  
  If performance becomes an issue, consider narrowing the scope of the event listener (e.g. delegate only to a specific container rather than `document.body`) to reduce unnecessary invocations.

- **Code Modularity:**  
  The current implementation could be refactored into smaller, reusable functions. For instance, separate the logic for handling the click event from the extraction and mapping logic to enhance readability and maintainability.

- **Commenting and Documentation:**  
  More inline comments explaining the purpose of key sections of the code (e.g. why filtering by trigger type is used) would help future maintainers understand the flow more quickly.

- **Error Logging:**  
  Even with the ES5 requirement, consider adding log statements (e.g. using `console.log` or `console.error`) to indicate when expected DOM elements are not found or other unexpected conditions occur. This can aid in debugging without resorting to modern logging libraries.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  - Regularly review and test the functionality whenever there are changes to the global objects (`LBGAnalytics.datalayer` and `LBGAnalytics.events`) or the DOM structure of the target page.
  - Ensure that any changes to the domain-specific attributes (like `data-show-elements` content) are coordinated with the front-end team to maintain compatibility.

- **Ownership:**  
  - Identify and document the team or individual responsible for maintaining the code. Establish a standard operating procedure for deploying updates particularly if the extension’s dependencies evolve.

- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Test in multiple browsers to verify that DOM queries and event handling work consistently, especially since the extension relies solely on ES5 and standard DOM APIs.
  - Include unit tests (where possible) or manual testing steps to validate that clicking the elements triggers the correct behaviour, both in typical cases and when potential DOM elements are missing.
  - Simulate edge cases where attributes may be malformed or elements are absent to confirm the extension fails gracefully without breaking other functionalities.

- **Documentation Updates:**  
  - Keep this documentation in sync with code changes, ensuring that any new features, modifications, or deprecations are clearly communicated to all stakeholders.
