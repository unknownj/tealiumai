# CSP Fill Extension Documentation

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name**: CSP Fill  
- **ID**: 1718 (Extension ID: 100036)  
- **Type**: Javascript Code  
- **Scope**: Pre Loader  
- **Execution Frequency**: Run Once  

### Summary

The CSP Fill extension dynamically constructs and applies a Content Security Policy (CSP) to the page based on a predefined configuration of CSP profiles. It also adds event handlers to capture and report any CSP violation events. The extension’s purpose is to enhance security by controlling the sources from which content—such as scripts, images, fonts, and media—can be loaded. Additionally, it incorporates a test switch mechanism via query string parameters and cookies, ensuring that CSP rules are enforced only on approved hostnames or specific paths.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Global Scope and Initialisation

- **Global Object Check**:  
  The code begins by checking if `window.LBGCSP` is already defined. If not, it initialises it as an empty object and immediately executes an anonymous function to set up and configure the CSP functionality.

- **Anonymous Function Parameters**:  
  The function takes two arguments: `target` (which is the `window.LBGCSP` object) and `config` (an object containing the CSP profiles for different sections such as “core”, “marketing”, “media” and “service”).

### Key Variables & Functions

- **target.config**:  
  Stores the CSP configuration object provided by Tealium iQ.

- **target.parentDomain**:  
  Dynamically calculates the parent domain from `window.location.hostname`.  
  - For UK domains (ending in .uk), it joins the last three tokens.  
  - For other domains, it joins the last two tokens.  
  This is used to implicitly trust subdomains.

- **target.profilesToString (profileFilter)**:  
  This function:
  - Uses a filter (passed as parameter) to determine which profiles of the configuration are in scope.
  - Reduces and extracts all unique CSP scope names included in the in-scope profiles.
  - For each scope (e.g. script-src, img-src, etc.), it starts with a base list that includes:
    • The scope name  
    • The `'self'` token  
    • The parent domain (and any subdomains via a wildcard entry)
  - Aggregates additional endpoints from relevant profiles while ensuring uniqueness.
  - Returns a string representation of the overall CSP, where each scope’s list is joined by spaces and different scopes are separated by semicolons.

- **target.addMetaTag (content)**:  
  Creates a `<meta>` tag with the “Content-Security-Policy” http-equiv attribute and provided content.  
  - Appends the meta tag to the document `<head>`.
  - Marks a performance metric (“CSP Applied”) if supported.

- **target.applyContentSecurityPolicy (profileExpression)**:  
  Main function to apply the CSP.
  - First, it checks for specific conditions (Target environment and Adobe Analytics related checks) where it might skip further execution.
  - Prevents re-execution by checking if a policy is already applied.
  - Determines the profile filter based on the provided `profileExpression`:
    • If `"*"`, not provided, or `"default"`, then it uses all profiles.
    • If a string is provided (for example, `"core,marketing"`), it always includes `"core"` and the additional comma-separated profiles.
  - Constructs the final CSP string using `profilesToString`.
  - Calls `addMetaTag` to inject the CSP meta tag.
  - Returns the name of the policy that is applied.

- **Violation Handling**:  
  - An array `target.violationList` is used to store unique violation strings.
  - The method `target.violationList.on(callback)` lets external code register event callbacks that will be executed on violation.
  - `target.addViolationEventHandlers` binds an event listener to the document’s `securitypolicyviolation` event. The handler builds an error string incorporating:
    • Policy name  
    • Disposition (e.g. report or enforce)  
    • Directive (first token or adjusted for element types)  
    • Blocked URI  
  - Registered callbacks are called with the violation error string and event details. Duplicate errors are prevented.

### Query String and Cookie Overrides

- **Test Switch**:  
  Attempts to parse the query string for an `enableCSP` parameter. If found, the value is set in a session cookie with the parent domain to persist the override state.

- **Cookie Based Override**:  
  On page load, the extension reads the `LBGAnalyticsCSP` cookie. If an override exists, it calls `applyContentSecurityPolicy` with the override value.

### CSP Enablement and Meta Tag Trigger

- The `CSPEnablement` object:
  - Contains an array of hostnames or URL paths where CSP is enabled.
  - Provides a method `isEnabled` to check if the current page's hostname or full path matches one of the enabled entries.
  - If the current page is enabled, it injects a meta tag with the name `LBG-CSP` and content `"default"`.
- Later, the extension checks for this meta tag via `foundCSPDeployInstruction` and if found with content `"default"`, it applies the default content security policy by calling `applyContentSecurityPolicy("default")`.

### Integration with External Analytics

- **LBGAnalytics Integration**:  
  If `window.LBGAnalytics.correlations` exists:
  - Once a CSP policy is applied, it sends a correlation event with a CSP deployment string.
  - When CSP violations occur, it sends additional correlation events to report the violations.

### Dependency on Global Objects

- Global objects used include:
  - `window`, `document`, and `document.head` for DOM manipulation.
  - Performance API (`window.performance.mark`) if available.
  - External objects such as `window.LBGAnalytics` (and its inner objects) are used to track and send correlation events.

---

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Execution Flow

1. **Standard Page Load on an Enabled Host**:  
   - The page’s hostname is compared against the `CSPEnablement.enabled` list.
   - A meta tag for CSP enablement (`<meta name="LBG-CSP" content="default" />`) is added.
   - The function `foundCSPDeployInstruction` detects the meta tag and calls `applyContentSecurityPolicy("default")`.
   - A CSP string is constructed from all available profiles (defaulting to “core” and others as needed).
   - The resulting meta tag with `http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy"` is appended to the document head.
   - If `LBGAnalytics` is available, a correlation event is sent marking the successful CSP deployment.

2. **CSP Violation Event**:  
   - When a resource is blocked by the applied CSP, a `securitypolicyviolation` event is fired.
   - The event handler processes the violation and formats a unique error string.
   - This error is added to a list if it is not already present.
   - Registered event handlers via `violationList.on(...)` (such as those in LBGAnalytics) are triggered to send a correlation event reporting the violation.

### Edge Conditions

- **Non-Enabled Host**:  
  - If the current page’s hostname or path does not match an entry in `CSPEnablement.enabled`, then the meta tag for CSP enablement is not injected. Hence, the CSP is not applied.

- **Query String/Cookie Overrides**:  
  - If a URL contains `?enableCSP=value`, a cookie is set accordingly.  
  - On refresh, if an override cookie is present, CSP is applied as per the provided override value overriding the default behaviour.

- **Context-Specific Bypass**:  
  - If the page is loaded in an iframe (Target environment) or certain Adobe Analytics conditions are met, the extension will not apply the CSP.

---

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Environment-Specific Exceptions**:  
  - The extension explicitly avoids applying CSP when running inside an iframe in contexts such as Target or if certain analytics cookies exist, which may lead to inconsistent behaviour if those conditions are not well understood or documented for every deployment.

- **Cookie and Query String Parsing**:  
  - The query string parsing logic is simple and might fail if the URL contains encoded characters or unusual parameter structures.
  - The cookie override logic assumes that the cookie string structure is consistent and does not handle multiple instances.

- **Global Dependency Conflicts**:  
  - The extension depends on global objects such as `window.LBGCSP` and `window.LBGAnalytics`. If multiple extensions or scripts modify these objects, potential conflicts may occur.

- **ES5 Restriction**:  
  - The code is written in ES5 syntax intentionally, which may lead to longer, more verbose code. This limits the use of newer and potentially clearer JavaScript constructs.

- **Meta Tag Injection Timing**:  
  - Since the extension runs as a “Run Once” Pre Loader, any changes to the document’s head after initial load might affect the ordering or existence of the CSP meta tag.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks and Error Handling**:  
  - While the code already contains try/catch blocks, consider adding more robust error logging (e.g. using console logging or sending errors to a monitoring endpoint) to capture silent failures.
  - Validate the structure of the CSP configuration object before using it.

- **Modularisation**:  
  - Refactor the code into modular functions or separate files where feasible (e.g. one module for CSP string construction, another for violation event binding). This would improve maintainability even though ES2015 features are not allowed.

- **Code Style**:  
  - Continue following consistent indentation and commenting styles.
  - Although ES6 features are disallowed, improvements such as more consistent function naming and reducing deep nesting in functions (for readability) are recommended.

- **Optimise Query String and Cookie Parsing**:  
  - Consider abstracting the parsing of query strings and cookies to small utility functions to reduce repetitive code and potential errors.

- **Documented Configuration Options**:  
  - Provide clear comments or external documentation on how the CSP configuration object should be structured, including the expected keys and values for profiles such as “core”, “marketing”, “media” and “service”.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance**:  
  - Ensure that any updates to the CSP configuration object (e.g. inclusion of new domains or endpoints) are coordinated between security teams and front-end developers.
  - Monitor the security event logs (via LBGAnalytics correlations) regularly to identify any frequently occurring violations that may need further adjustment of the CSP profiles.

- **Ownership and Testing Guidelines**:  
  - Designate a team or individual responsible for CSP policy updates and monitoring.
  - Automated tests should include:
    • Verification that the correct meta tag is injected under the expected conditions.
    • Simulation of CSP violations to ensure that event handlers capture and report errors appropriately.
    • Tests to cover edge cases such as when the extension is not enabled due to environment checks.
  - Perform manual testing across all supported browsers to ensure the extension behaves as expected, especially under different deployment scenarios.

- **Further Documentation**:  
  - Maintain an internal wiki or a README file in your repository with examples of configuration changes and troubleshooting tips for common issues.
  - Keep a change log for the CSP configuration object, recording updates to endpoints and policy adjustments.
