# iWeb Brand Fix Extension Documentation

This document outlines the details of the "iWeb Brand fix" Tealium iQ extension, providing an in-depth analysis of its functionality, design, usage, known limitations, and recommendations for future improvements.

---

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name**: iWeb Brand fix  
- **ID**: 1720  
- **Extension Type**: Advanced Javascript Code  
- **Scope**: Before Load Rules  
- **Execution Frequency**: Run Always  

**Summary**:  
This extension examines the domain contained within the data payload and checks if it includes the substring "iweb". If it does, the extension assigns the brand value to "iWeb" in the event payload. The purpose is to standardise the brand name based on the domain, ensuring consistent tracking and reporting for iWeb properties.

---

## 2. Code Explanation

The code is encapsulated in an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) to prevent polluting the global scope.

### Key Variables and Parameters
- **a (eventType)**: Represents the event type. Although its value is not explicitly used in the logic, it is passed in as part of the extension's parameters.
- **b (eventPayload)**: Object containing the event data. This object is where the 'dom.domain' property is checked and where the 'Brand' property is set if needed.

### Logic Flow
1. **Domain Check**:  
   The code accesses the `dom.domain` property from the event payload (object `b`). It then checks if the returned value contains the substring "iweb".  
   ```javascript
   if (b['dom.domain'].indexOf("iweb") !== -1) {
   ```
   - If it finds "iweb" in the domain, it proceeds to the next step.
   - The check utilises the `indexOf` method to determine the presence of the substring. A result other than -1 confirms that "iweb" is part of the domain.
   
2. **Brand Assignment**:  
   If the condition is met, the code assigns the string "iWeb" to the property `Brand` of the event payload:
   ```javascript
   b['Brand'] = "iWeb";
   ```
   This modification ensures that the brand attribute is set consistently across events where the domain indicates the iWeb brand.

### Dependencies and Assumptions
- The extension assumes the availability of two global objects (or variables), `eventType` and `eventPayload`, which are guaranteed to be present and correctly typed.
- It does not require any external libraries and is designed to work in environments that support ES5.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Normal Condition (iWeb Domain)
**Input Payload**:
```javascript
{
  'dom.domain': "www.iweb.co.uk",
  // other properties...
}
```
**Behaviour**:
- The function checks the domain string and finds "iweb".
- Sets `eventPayload['Brand']` to `"iWeb"`.
  
**Resulting Payload**:
```javascript
{
  'dom.domain': "www.iweb.co.uk",
  'Brand': "iWeb",
  // other properties...
}
```

### Scenario 2: Non-iWeb Domain
**Input Payload**:
```javascript
{
  'dom.domain': "www.example.com",
  // other properties...
}
```
**Behaviour**:
- The check for the substring "iweb" in `dom.domain` fails.
- The code does nothing, leaving the payload unchanged.
  
**Resulting Payload**:
```javascript
{
  'dom.domain': "www.example.com",
  // other properties remain intact...
}
```

### Scenario 3: Edge Condition (Case Sensitivity)
**Input Payload**:
```javascript
{
  'dom.domain': "www.IWEB.co.uk",
  // other properties...
}
```
**Behaviour**:
- The check is case-sensitive. Since "IWEB" does not match "iweb", the condition will not be met.
- As a result, `eventPayload['Brand']` will not be set to `"iWeb"`.

**Resulting Payload**:
```javascript
{
  'dom.domain': "www.IWEB.co.uk",
  // no Brand property added...
}
```

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Case Sensitivity Issue**:  
  The substring check using `indexOf("iweb")` is case-sensitive; domains that contain "IWEB" (or any other case variation) will not trigger the brand assignment. This might lead to missed assignments if the domain case is inconsistent.

- **Dependency on Payload Structure**:  
  The extension assumes that the `eventPayload` object always includes a valid `dom.domain` property. If this property is missing or malformed, the extension may not function as expected.

- **Potential Conflicts with Other Extensions**:  
  - If another extension is also modifying the `Brand` property, the order of execution may lead to conflicting values.  
  - Ensure that this extension is executed in an appropriate sequence relative to others that might read or modify the `Brand` property.

---

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Improve Case Insensitivity**:  
  Modify the domain check to handle case variations. For example, convert the domain value to lower case before checking for the substring "iweb".  
  *Example (ES5 compliant)*:
  ```javascript
  if (b['dom.domain'].toLowerCase().indexOf("iweb") !== -1) {
      b['Brand'] = "iWeb";
  }
  ```
- **Modularisation and Code Comments**:  
  - Add inline comments to explain the purpose of the condition and brand assignment for better readability and maintainability.  
  - Consider modularising additional logic if further brand-specific checks are required in the future.
  
- **Naming Conventions**:  
  It may be beneficial to use more descriptive variable names internally (e.g. renaming 'a' to 'eventType' and 'b' to 'payload') for better clarity during maintenance and reviews.

- **Testing and Unit Tests**:  
  Develop a variety of test cases that include normal, edge, and error conditions to ensure the extension performs as expected.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance**:  
  - Document any changes to the extension logic in version control.  
  - Review the extension periodically, especially if changes are made to the data payload structure or if new domains are to be supported.
  
- **Ownership and Testing**:  
  - Assign a maintainer or a team to periodically review the extension to ensure it aligns with the overall tagging strategy.  
  - Ensure that testing guidelines are adhered to, particularly testing various domain strings (including edge cases) in a staging environment before production deployment.

- **Future Enhancements**:  
  Consider extending the logic to handle a wider variety of domains or more complex brand mapping scenarios. Incorporate unit testing frameworks that are compatible with ES5 to automate regression tests following any future modifications.
