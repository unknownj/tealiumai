# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation - Block Inbox Spam

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name**: Block Inbox Spam  
- **ID**: 1721  
- **Type**: Javascript Code  
- **Scope**: 928  
- **Execution Frequency**: Active  

### Summary
The "Block Inbox Spam" extension is designed to prevent the display of duplicate inbox content in the mobile app by blocking access to a specific path. Once the user accesses the inbox, the extension ensures that they cannot re-enter that section on subsequent attempts. This is particularly useful for improving user experience by avoiding redundant content.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- **`window.location.pathname`**: Utilises the current URL path to determine the user's location within the application.
- **`window.noMoreInbox`**: A boolean flag to control access to the inbox.

### Logic Flow
1. The extension checks if the current pathname starts with `/personal/a/mobile/inbox/`.
2. If the user is indeed accessing the inbox:
   - It checks if `window.noMoreInbox` is already set to `true`.
   - If it is, the function returns `false`, effectively blocking any further access.
   - If `window.noMoreInbox` is not set, it sets it to `true`, indicating that the inbox has been accessed.

### Dependencies
- The extension relies on the global `window` object but does not interact with any external libraries or scripts.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Condition
- **Scenario**: User navigates to `/personal/a/mobile/inbox/`.
  - **Behaviour**: The first access sets `window.noMoreInbox` to `true`. The user can see the inbox as intended.

### Edge Condition
- **Scenario**: User attempts to re-access `/personal/a/mobile/inbox/`.
  - **Behaviour**: The extension checks `window.noMoreInbox`, finds it set to `true`, and therefore prevents further access.

### Data Flow
- The extension processes the current URL path and modifies the `window` object based on user interaction. It does not accept or produce any data beyond its internal state handling.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Single-Session Limitation**: The extension will only block re-access during the same browser session. Once the session is refreshed or restarted, the flag resets, allowing re-access to the inbox.
  
- **Potential Conflicts**: If there are other extensions or scripts that manipulate `window.noMoreInbox`, conflicts may arise leading to unintended accessibility.

- **User Behaviour**: Users may clear their cache or utilise incognito modes, which can disrupt the intended behaviour of blocking inbox access.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Encapsulation**: Consider encapsulating the logic within a self-invoking function to prevent pollutants in the global namespace.
  
- **Modularisation**: While the current extension is minimal, think about separating the logic into smaller, testable functions for better readability and maintenance.

- **Debugging Support**: Implement logging statements to help trace the flow during debugging. For example, consider adding `console.log` statements to indicate when access is blocked or allowed.

- **Defensive Checks**: Include checks to ensure that the global `window` object and its properties are accessible, although this is less critical given the guarantee of `eventType` and `eventPayload`.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ownership**: Assign a dedicated developer or team to oversee the extension, ensuring it remains effective and relevant to user needs.

- **Testing Guidelines**: Implement testing procedures, both manual and automated, to verify the extensionâ€™s performance during various user scenarios. Pay particular attention to browser compatibility.

- **Documentation Updates**: Encourage regular updates to the documentation as changes and enhancements are made to the extension for future reference.

- **Version Control**: Maintain proper version control practices to track enhancements and bug fixes effectively.
