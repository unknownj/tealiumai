# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: Block Inbox Spam

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name**: Block Inbox Spam
- **ID**: 1721
- **Type**: JavaScript Code
- **Scope**: 928
- **Execution Frequency**: Active

### Summary
The "Block Inbox Spam" extension is designed to prevent spam messages from appearing in the mobile inbox of users. It achieves this by checking the user's current page URL and employing a flag mechanism (`window.noMoreInbox`) to ensure that spam inbox notifications are only processed a single time during the session, thus enhancing user experience by reducing clutter.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- `a`, `b`, `u`: Parameters passed to the anonymous function, where:
  - `eventType` (represented by `a`)
  - `eventPayload` (represented by `b`)
  - `tagObject` (represented by `u`)
  
### Logic Flow
1. The function immediately checks if the current page is the mobile inbox page (`"/personal/a/mobile/inbox/"`).
2. If the user is already flagged as having seen the spam inbox (`window.noMoreInbox` is true), the function exits early and does not proceed with any action.
3. If the user has not seen the spam inbox yet, it sets `window.noMoreInbox` to true, effectively blocking any further spam notifications.

### Dependencies
This extension relies on the following global object:
- `window`: Used to store and retrieve the `noMoreInbox` flag which prevents processing of spam inbox notifications.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Conditions
- When a user accesses their mobile inbox for the first time on the specified path (e.g., `/personal/a/mobile/inbox/`), the flag `window.noMoreInbox` is set to true, allowing normal inbox usage without interruptions from spam notifications.

### Edge Conditions
- If the user attempts to refresh or revisit the mobile inbox page after the initial load, the presence of the flag `window.noMoreInbox` will prevent any spam inbox notifications from being processed a second time, ensuring a clean user experience.

### Data Flow Illustration
- **Input**: User navigates to `/personal/a/mobile/inbox/`
- **Processing**: The script checks the path and the flag, sets the flag if not already set.
- **Output**: User experiences the inbox without the distraction of spam notifications.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Single Page Application (SPA)**: This solution may not function effectively in SPA environments where the URL may change without a full page reload.
- **Conflicts with Other Scripts**: If additional scripts attempt to manipulate the `window.noMoreInbox` flag without proper checks, unexpected behaviour could arise.
- **User Behaviour**: If a user clears their browser cache or modifies the `window` object directly, the behaviour of the extension may become unpredictable.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks**: While the code assumes the presence of `eventType` and `eventPayload`, it could be beneficial to implement logging in case unexpected values are passed.
- **Code Style**: Consistent indentation and spacing improve readability. Commenting could also be added to clarify logic intent.
- **Modularisation**: Consider breaking down the logic into smaller, reusable functions to increase maintainability. For example, separating URL checking logic from the logic that sets the flag may make testing and future updates easier.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ownership**: Designate a team member responsible for the ongoing maintenance of this extension, ensuring that they are aware of its logic and potential implications in future versions of the mobile inbox.
- **Testing Guidelines**: Regularly test the extension across different devices and browsers, especially after major updates to the Tealium iQ environment or any related scripts.
- **Documentation Updates**: Keep this documentation updated with any changes made to the extension or usage scenarios encountered during testing.
