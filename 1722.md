# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: CSP to prop50

## 1. Extension Overview
- **Name**: CSP to prop50
- **ID**: 1722
- **Type**: Javascript Code
- **Scope**: 928
- **Execution Frequency**: Active

### Summary
This extension captures the `policyName` from the `window.LBGCSP` global object (if it exists) and assigns it to `s.prop50`. It is designed to map Content Security Policy (CSP) values into the Tealium data layer for use in analytics, enabling better tracking and reporting of CSP-related policies applied to the web application.

## 2. Code Explanation

```javascript
(function(a,b,u){
    if(window.LBGCSP && window.LBGCSP.policyName) 
        s.prop50 = window.LBGCSP.policyName;
})(eventType, eventPayload, tagObject);
```

### Key Variables
- **`window.LBGCSP`**: A global object that contains CSP information.
- **`window.LBGCSP.policyName`**: A specific property of the `LBGCSP` object that holds the policy name.
- **`s.prop50`**: A variable in the Tealium data layer that will store the value of the CSP policy name.

### Logic Flow
1. The code is encapsulated within an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE), which provides an isolated scope.
2. It checks for the existence of `window.LBGCSP` and its property `policyName`.
3. If both are present, it assigns the `policyName` value to `s.prop50`.

### Dependencies
- The extension depends on the global object `window.LBGCSP`. If this object or the `policyName` attribute is not present, the assignment to `s.prop50` will not occur.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Scenario
- **Data Flow**: If `window.LBGCSP.policyName` is set to `"CSP-Policy-1"`, upon executing the extension, `s.prop50` will be updated as follows:
  - `s.prop50 = "CSP-Policy-1";`

### Edge Conditions
- **Missing Global Object**: If `window.LBGCSP` does not exist:
  - No changes will be made to `s.prop50`.
- **Missing Policy Name**: If `window.LBGCSP.policyName` exists but is `undefined` or an empty string:
  - `s.prop50` will not receive an update.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas
- **Dependency on Global Object**: If the `LBGCSP` object is not defined before this extension runs, it will not execute the assignment, leading to possible data gaps.
- **Potential Naming Conflicts**: If multiple extensions modify `s.prop50`, the last one to run will overwrite the previous value without warning.
- **Invalid Value Handling**: If `policyName` exists but has a non-string value, it could still be assigned to `s.prop50`, which may lead to unintended behaviour in downstream code consuming `s.prop50`.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring
- **Check for Safety**: Consider validating that `policyName` is a string before assignment, to avoid unexpected data types (even though this goes against the request to avoid defensive coding).
  ```javascript
  if(typeof window.LBGCSP.policyName === 'string') {
      s.prop50 = window.LBGCSP.policyName;
  }
  ```
- **Self-Documenting Variable Names**: Using clearer variable names could enhance readability; however, without refactoring, it is important to document any implicit behaviours well.
- **Modularisation**: Break out the CSP assignment into a separate function for reuse or easier testing if multiple policy names are required in the future.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes
- **Ownership**: Designate a team member to oversee this extension, ensuring updates and documentation remain current.
- **Testing Guidelines**: Regularly test the extension, especially when updates are made to the `LBGCSP` object. Changes in the data structure or naming could necessitate adjustments to this code.
- **Continual Monitoring**: Monitor analytics to detect any anomalies or drops in data flow that may be related to the handling of `s.prop50`.
