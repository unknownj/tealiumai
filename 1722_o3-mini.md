# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: "CSP to prop50"

This document provides a comprehensive overview, code explanation, usage examples, known limitations, refactoring recommendations, and maintenance notes for the "CSP to prop50" Tealium iQ extension.

---

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** CSP to prop50  
- **ID:** 1722  
- **Extension ID:** 100036  
- **Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** 928  
- **Execution Frequency:** Executes on every event where the extension is active

**Summary:**  
This extension checks for the existence of a global object property (`window.LBGCSP.policyName`) and, if present, assigns its value to the `prop50` property on the Tealium data object (`s`). The primary purpose is to capture a Content Security Policy (CSP) policy name from a predefined global variable (`LBGCSP.policyName`) into a corresponding Tealium property for further processing or reporting.

---

## 2. Code Explanation

The extension code is wrapped in an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) to avoid polluting the global namespace. The code accepts three parameters:  
- **a (`eventType`):** Represents the type of the event, though it is not explicitly used in this extension.  
- **b (`eventPayload`):** Represents the payload of the event, likewise not directly utilised here.  
- **u (`tagObject`):** Represents the tag's context or additional metadata, but it is unused in the provided code.

### Key Variables and Logic Flow

- **Global Dependency:**  
  - `window.LBGCSP`: The code depends on the global object `LBGCSP`.  
  - `window.LBGCSP.policyName`: The specific property of `LBGCSP` utilised to assign a value.

- **Core Logic:**
  1. **Check for Global Object and Property:**  
     The code determines if `window.LBGCSP` exists and has a truthy `policyName` attribute.
  
  2. **Assign Value:**  
     If the condition is met, it assigns the value of `window.LBGCSP.policyName` to the Tealium data layer property `s.prop50`.

### Code Listing

    (function(a, b, u) {
      if (window.LBGCSP && window.LBGCSP.policyName) {
        s.prop50 = window.LBGCSP.policyName;
      }
    })(eventType, eventPayload, tagObject);

*Notes:*  
- The variables `eventType`, `eventPayload`, and `tagObject` are provided by Tealium’s environment and are guaranteed to be available.
- The assignment statement `s.prop50 = window.LBGCSP.policyName` assumes that the `s` object is available in the global scope as is standard in Tealium environments.

---

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Scenario

**Situation:**  
- The global object `window.LBGCSP` exists and its property `policyName` holds the value `"SecurePolicy123"`.

**Behaviour:**  
- When an event is processed, the extension checks for `window.LBGCSP` and finds `policyName` set to `"SecurePolicy123"`.  
- The extension then assigns `"SecurePolicy123"` to `s.prop50`, making it available for tracking or further use.

**Illustration:**

    // Global object definition before the event is fired
    window.LBGCSP = {
      policyName: "SecurePolicy123"
    };

    // During event processing, the extension sets:
    s.prop50 = "SecurePolicy123";

---

### Edge Scenario

**Situation:**  
- The global object `window.LBGCSP` is undefined, or the property `policyName` is not set (falsy).

**Behaviour:**  
- The conditional check fails.
- No assignment to `s.prop50` occurs.
- As a result, `s.prop50` remains unchanged or undefined, which might affect any subsequent processing relying on it.

**Illustration:**

    // When window.LBGCSP is undefined or does not contain policyName
    window.LBGCSP = {}; // or window.LBGCSP is not defined at all

    // During event processing, the condition fails:
    if (window.LBGCSP && window.LBGCSP.policyName) { ... }
    // Therefore, s.prop50 is not set.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Dependency on Global Object:**  
  The extension relies solely on the availability and structure of `window.LBGCSP`. If this global object is modified or removed by other scripts, it might lead to unexpected behaviour.
  
- **Single Property Check:**  
  The code only checks for the existence of `policyName` within `window.LBGCSP`. Any changes in the naming convention or nesting (for example, if `policyName` moves to a sub-object) will break this functionality.

- **Conflict with Other Extensions:**  
  If another Tealium extension writes to `s.prop50` later in the tag firing sequence, the value set by this extension might be overwritten or cause conflicts.

- **No Error Handling:**  
  The extension does not provide any logging or error handling for scenarios where the expected global object or property is missing, which could complicate troubleshooting.

---

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks:**  
  Although not required for the existence of `eventType` or `eventPayload`, consider adding additional checks for the format of `window.LBGCSP.policyName` if necessary. This could avoid unexpected behaviour if the value is not in the anticipated format.
  
- **Modularity:**  
  Encapsulate functionality in a named function instead of an anonymous IIFE if multiple references or unit testing become necessary in the future.

- **Documentation within Code:**  
  Adding inline comments will help future developers understand the rationale behind the check and the assignment to `s.prop50`.

- **Order of Execution:**  
  If multiple extensions are setting values on the `s` object, ensure that the execution order does not cause overwrites. In such cases, coordinating the order via load rules or extension sequencing in Tealium might be beneficial.

*Note:*  
Keep in mind that the code must adhere to ES5 standards; therefore, refrain from using ES2015/ES6 features such as arrow functions, template literals, or block-scoped variables (let/const).

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  Develop test cases to cover scenarios with and without `window.LBGCSP.policyName` present. Unit tests can simulate the global object’s state and validate that `s.prop50` is set or remains unchanged accordingly.

- **Monitoring Dependencies:**  
  Maintain awareness of any changes to the global object `window.LBGCSP` by coordinating with the relevant teams. A versioning strategy for the global object might be necessary to ensure compatibility.

- **Version Control & Ownership:**  
  Keep this extension’s code in a version-controlled repository. Encourage code comments and documentation updates whenever modifications are made. Clearly define a primary owner or maintainer for this extension.

- **Documentation Updates:**  
  Regularly review and update this documentation to reflect any changes in functionality, integration points with other systems, or dependencies on external scripts.

- **Stakeholder Communication:**  
  Share these documentation updates with both developers and stakeholders to ensure that any dependency or potential conflicts are well understood and managed.

By following these guidelines and recommendations, developers can ensure that the "CSP to prop50" extension remains robust, maintainable, and well-documented for future use and troubleshooting.
