# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: God Mode

## 1. Extension Overview
- **Name**: God Mode
- **ID**: 100036
- **Type**: Javascript Code
- **Scope**: DOM Ready
- **Execution Frequency**: Run Once

### Summary
The **God Mode** extension is designed to assist developers and testers in debugging and interacting with the Tealium environment. This extension provides a command palette that allows for real-time manipulation of the analytics trigger system, cookie management, and visibility into the current data layer state. The purpose is to streamline debugging tasks and give access to frequently used functions without needing to navigate through the standard UI.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- **el**: An object providing methods to create HTML/SVG elements and manipulate styles and attributes.
- **getNextZIndex**: A function to calculate the next available z-index for overlay elements.
- **funcs**: An array of objects representing commands available in the command palette, each containing labels and actions.
- **idspispopd**: A state variable that manages the activation of the extension based on key events.

### Logic Flow
1. **Element Creation**: The extension uses the `el` object to create various HTML elements, such as input fields and buttons, based on provided selectors.
2. **Command Palette Initialization**: On load, the extension constructs a UI for the command palette and listens for keyboard input.
3. **Command Execution**: As users type commands, the extension compares inputs against available commands and presents matching options.
4. **Contextual Actions**: Users can perform various actions related to Tealium analytics, cookies, and debugging directly from the command palette.

### Dependencies on Global Objects or Libraries
- **window.LBGAnalytics**: The extension relies heavily on the LBGAnalytics object for manipulating trigger views, accessing the datalayer, and managing cookies.
- **document**: Utilised for manipulating DOM to create and modify UI elements.

## 3. Usage Examples
### Normal Usage
1. **Disabling Trigger Views**: A developer can type "Disable triggerView for session" into the command input to halt the current tracking session.
2. **View Current Data Layer**: Typing "View current Tealium datalayer" displays the current state of the data layer in a readable format.

### Edge Cases
1. **Invalid Commands**: If a user inputs a non-existent command, no matches will appear, and the suggestions list remains empty, preventing confusion.
2. **Cookie Management Errors**: If there are issues in accessing cookies, actions related to cookie clearing will fail without crashing the extension.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas
- **Browser Compatibility**: Ensure testing across various browsers since older versions may have inconsistent support for modern JavaScript features, even as ES5 is supported.
- **Performance Impact**: The real-time execution of commands may slow down the browser if many commands are processed simultaneously, especially in a heavy data layer environment.
- **Potential Conflicts**: There may be conflicts with other Tealium extensions that modify the same elements or global objects.

---

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring
- **Improve Code Modularity**: Segregating UI element creation, event handling, and command execution into distinct functions would enhance maintainability and readability.
- **Consistent Logging**: Introduce console logging for critical operations to aid in debugging without impacting performance.
- **Error Handling**: Implement basic error handling for DOM manipulation and API calls to gracefully manage unexpected failures without crashing the command palette.

---

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes
- **Ongoing Maintenance**: Regular reviews of the extension should be scheduled in line with updates to the Tealium framework to ensure compatibility and performance.
- **Ownership**: Assign specific team members as custodians of the God Mode extension to oversee updates and ensure documentation remains accurate.
- **Testing Guidelines**: Establish a robust testing protocol that includes automated tests for command execution outcomes and manual testing in the development environment.
