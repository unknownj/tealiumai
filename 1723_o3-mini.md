# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation – God Mode

This document provides a comprehensive overview and analysis of the "God Mode" Tealium iQ extension. It explains the extension’s purpose, internal code workings, usage scenarios, limitations, and recommendations for future improvements while maintaining ES5 compatibility.

---

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** God Mode  
- **ID:** 1723  
- **Extension Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** DOM Ready  
- **Execution Frequency (Occurrence):** Run Once  

### Summary

The God Mode extension creates a hidden command palette that enables a variety of debugging and utility functions for Tealium’s tracking environment. This command palette provides an interactive UI injected into the DOM which includes:

- A user input box for command searching and execution.
- A list of suggested commands dynamically filtered based on user input.
- A result/info box to display output or information after executing a command.
- Keyboard shortcuts and an optional icon (if a cookie is set) to trigger palette display.

The extension leverages this interface to execute various commands that can manipulate Tealium’s data layer, trigger event tracking functions (such as triggerView manipulations), handle cookies, interact with external scripts (e.g. Adobe Target, webchat section IDs) and dynamically inject debugging assets.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables & Objects

- **IIFE & Override Flag:**  
  The entire extension is encapsulated in an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) with an `override` argument. When the override is true, the `init()` function is immediately executed.

- **`el` Object:**  
  A helper object that provides methods to create DOM elements:
  - `make(selector, optionalText, optionalStyleObject)`: Parses a CSS-like selector string to build an HTML element, apply classes, IDs, attributes, inner text (or HTML), and custom styles.
  - `text(value)`: Creates and returns a text node.
  - `draw(selector, optionalText, optionalStyleObject)`: Similar to `make` but uses `document.createElementNS` for drawing SVG elements. The parsing logic for selectors is repeated and similar to `make`.

- **`getNextZIndex` Function:**  
  Computes the next highest z-index on the page by inspecting all DOM elements. This helps ensure that the command palette appears on top of all other elements.

- **`idspispopd` Variable:**  
  A state flag used to track the sequence of key presses. It ensures that the command palette is launched only after a specific key combination (ctrl+alt+j followed by ctrl+alt+w) is detected.

- **`funcs` Array:**  
  Contains a list of command objects and functions that represent the individual commands available in the command palette. Each command object may include:
  - `label`: The display text for the command.
  - `action`: The function executed when a command is selected.
  - `suggest`: A function that returns a boolean (or computed list) indicating whether the command is relevant in a given state.
  - `info`: A function to generate printable output returned by the command, typically formatted as JSON or HTML.
  - `prompt`: For commands that require user input (via `window.prompt`).

- **Global Dependency – window.LBGAnalytics:**  
  Many actions depend on the existence of a global object `LBGAnalytics`. This object provides methods to manipulate:
  - Trigger view behaviour (`triggerView.disable()`, `.enable()`, and `.invoke()`)
  - Data layer access via `LBGAnalytics.datalayer.get()`
  - Cookie manipulation using `LBGAnalytics.cookies` and consent functions via `LBGAnalytics.consents`
  - Adobe Visitor ID Service versions and analytics library details

### Logic Flow

1. **Initialisation (`init` function):**
   - Dynamically appends a Google Font stylesheet for consistent styling.
   - Creates the command palette container (a fixed-position `<section>` element) with styled input elements.
   - Sets up an input box (via the `el.make` helper) for the user to type their commands.
   - Adds UI elements such as a “move” button to reposition the palette from the top to the bottom of the screen, a suggestions list (`<ul>`), and an information box (`<div>`).

2. **Suggestions and Command Execution:**
   - An event listener on the input field listens for keyup events.
   - The current input string is split into parts and used to filter the available commands from `funcs`.
   - The UI list is dynamically updated with matching commands.
   - Clicking on a suggestion executes the corresponding command:
     - If the command has a prompt property, the user is prompted for input.
     - The command’s `action` is executed.
     - If available, the `info` callback displays the output or results in the info box.

3. **Keyboard Shortcut Listener:**
   - A document-level `keyup` event listens for a sequence of key presses (ctrl+alt+j then ctrl+alt+w) to trigger the command palette if it isn’t already active.
   - Alternatively, a global function (`window.enableLBGAnalyticsCommandPalette`) can be invoked to initialise the palette.

4. **Additional UI – Command Palette Icon:**
   - If a specific cookie (`LBGCommandPaletteShortcut=true`) is detected, an SVG icon is injected into the page.
   - Clicking on the icon or right-clicking (to hide it) provides additional means to trigger the command palette.
   - The SVG is constructed using the `el.draw` method, utilising SVG namespaces, and includes a custom mask and gradient styling.

### Dependencies & External Scripts

- Google Fonts (Fira Code) for UI font styling.
- External tagging/analytics scripts loaded via dynamic `<script>` element insertion (e.g. `utag.1.js` and `utag.3.js`).
- Global libraries and objects:
  - `LBGAnalytics` and its sub-components.
  - `utag.cfg` for Tealium configuration.
  - Adobe Target (via global `adobe.target`) and Visitor ID Service.
- The code assumes a functional DOM environment and supportive global objects.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Operation

1. **Activation via Key Combination:**
   - The user presses ctrl+alt+j followed by ctrl+alt+w.  
   - The command palette is initialised and displayed at the top of the page.
   - The user can type part of a command (e.g. “triggerView” or “View datalayer”) in the input box.
   - Matching commands appear in the suggestions list.
   - Clicking a suggestion executes the command and, if applicable, displays additional output/info in the info box.

2. **Using the Command Palette Icon:**
   - When the cookie `LBGCommandPaletteShortcut=true` is present, the SVG icon appears.
   - The user may click the icon to directly invoke the command palette.
   - Right-clicking the icon hides it if needed.

### Input & Execution Flow

- **Command with Prompt:**  
  Some commands (e.g. “Invoke custom triggerView” or “Paste QA Link”) will prompt the user for additional input before executing.
  - The prompt value is parsed and used accordingly. For example, the QA Link command extracts query parameters, encodes them as JSON, and sets a cookie.

- **Dynamic Suggestions based on State:**  
  Commands such as “Disable triggerView for session” only appear if their associated `suggest` function returns true, e.g. if the trigger view history exists and is not yet disabled.

- **Edge Condition Handling:**  
  If no matching commands are found after filtering by the input text, the suggestions list remains hidden.  
  When errors occur in a command (e.g. missing properties in `LBGAnalytics`), try/catch mechanisms may return an "Error" message in the info box.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Global Object Dependencies:**  
  The extension relies heavily on `window.LBGAnalytics` and related properties (e.g. `triggerView`, `cookies`, `consents`). If these are not defined or are modified by other scripts, some commands may not function correctly.

- **Repeated Parsing Logic:**  
  The parsing logic in the `make` and `draw` functions is nearly identical. Any changes to element creation need to be duplicated in both functions, increasing the risk of inconsistencies.

- **CSS Selector Parsing:**  
  The selector parsing is simplistic and may not cover all valid CSS selectors. Complex selectors or ones with additional special characters might break the element creation process.

- **Potential Conflicts:**  
  Injecting external scripts (like utag scripts) and dynamically creating style elements might conflict with other Tealium extensions or third-party scripts if they modify the same namespaces or DOM elements.

- **Limited Error Handling:**  
  While some commands try/catch errors when accessing properties (e.g. in `info` functions), there is minimal defensive coding overall. The extension assumes the existence of certain global objects and scripts.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Modularise Common Logic:**  
  Consolidate the common selector parsing functionality used in both `el.make` and `el.draw` into a single utility function. This will reduce repetition and streamline future updates.

- **Improve Naming Conventions:**  
  Rename ambiguous variables and properties (e.g. `junk` in the element definition) to more descriptive names to clarify their purpose.

- **Enhanced Error Handling:**  
  Even though defensive checks for `eventType` or `eventPayload` aren’t required, consider wrapping critical operations (like DOM manipulations and JSON parsing) in additional try/catch blocks to prevent the entire extension from failing.

- **Code Comments and Documentation:**  
  Increase inline comments to explain non-obvious parts of the code—such as the key sequence logic (idspispopd) and the dynamic creation of SVG elements.

- **DRY Principle Enforcement:**  
  Extract repeated code blocks (for example, style application logic) into reusable helper functions. This adheres to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle and makes the codebase easier to maintain.

- **Testing & Debugging Hooks:**  
  Consider adding debugging flags or verbosity options that can be enabled during development, which may help in diagnosing issues without impacting production behaviour.

*Note:* All recommendations must maintain ES5 compatibility without using ES6 constructs such as arrow functions, template literals, and let/const.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Testing:**  
  Regularly test the extension across different browsers to ensure compatibility, especially focusing on DOM loading and event handling. Automated tests simulating key events may help verify the command activation logic.

- **Ownership & Documentation:**  
  Maintain and update this documentation alongside code changes. Consider versioning the extension and keeping a changelog for any modifications.

- **Monitoring Global Dependencies:**  
  Monitor updates to global objects (e.g., LBGAnalytics, utag.cfg) to ensure compatibility. Document any required versions or dependencies for reference.

- **Cross-Team Communication:**  
  As this extension touches several areas (Tealium data layer, Adobe Target, cookie management), ensure that all stakeholders and developers are aware of its integration points. Periodically review potential conflicts with other Tealium iQ extensions or third-party scripts.

- **Security Considerations:**  
  Since the extension dynamically injects scripts and manipulates cookies, verify that these injections are secure (e.g. use proper domains and secure flags) and do not inadvertently expose the site to cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
