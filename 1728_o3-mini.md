# LivePerson Override - SW Encashments

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** LivePerson Override - SW Encashments  
- **ID:** 1728  
- **Extension Type:** Advanced Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** Before Load Rules  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Always  

### Summary
This extension inspects the current canonical domain of the page (provided via the event payload). If the domain matches one of two specified values:
- "take-my-pension.scottishwidows.co.uk"  
- "appduv03b7.machine.test.group"

then the extension assigns the value of the canonical path (from the event payload) to a property called JourneyProduct. This override is a workaround solution that is scheduled for a fix by the end of August. The extension is designed to ensure that specific domain paths are captured and used correctly in downstream processing.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables

- **a, b:**  
  These represent the two parameters passed to the Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE). Although named generically (`a` and `b`), their values are provided as `eventType` and `eventPayload` respectively.  
  - **eventType (a):** A string identifying the type of event; however, it is not utilised further in this code.  
  - **eventPayload (b):** An object containing various properties (e.g., CanonicalDomain and CanonicalPath) required for processing.

### Logic Flow

1. **Domain Check:**  
   The code first checks whether the `CanonicalDomain` property from `eventPayload` equals either "take-my-pension.scottishwidows.co.uk" or "appduv03b7.machine.test.group".  
   - If the condition is met, the code assigns the value of `CanonicalPath` (from the same payload) to a new property `JourneyProduct`.

2. **Temporary Workaround:**  
   A comment indicates that this piece of logic is a workaround pending a scheduled update (end of August). This implies that the logic might be subject to future changes or removal.

### Dependencies

- **Global Objects:**  
  The extension relies on `eventType` and `eventPayload` being available in the global scope when executed. These are provided by Tealium iQ during the extension runtime.

- **No External Libraries:**  
  There are no dependencies on external libraries or modules. The extension uses plain ES5-compliant JavaScript.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Matching Canonical Domain
- **Input:**  
  - `eventPayload.CanonicalDomain = "take-my-pension.scottishwidows.co.uk"`
  - `eventPayload.CanonicalPath = "/some-livedata-path"`
- **Process:**  
  The condition matches the first domain.  
- **Output:**  
  - `eventPayload.JourneyProduct` is set to "/some-livedata-path".

### Scenario 2: Non-matching Canonical Domain
- **Input:**  
  - `eventPayload.CanonicalDomain = "www.example.com"`
  - `eventPayload.CanonicalPath = "/example-path"`
- **Process:**  
  The condition does not match any of the specified values.  
- **Output:**  
  - `eventPayload.JourneyProduct` remains unchanged (or undefined if not previously set).

### Edge Case: Matching Secondary Domain in Test Environment
- **Input:**  
  - `eventPayload.CanonicalDomain = "appduv03b7.machine.test.group"`
  - `eventPayload.CanonicalPath = "/test-path"`
- **Process:**  
  The condition matches the second domain.  
- **Output:**  
  - `eventPayload.JourneyProduct` is set to "/test-path".

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Limited Domain Checks:**  
  The logic strictly checks for two specific canonical domains. Any additional or future domains that require similar processing will need to be added manually.

- **Mutation of Event Payload:**  
  The code directly modifies the `eventPayload` object by setting `JourneyProduct`. Ensure that downstream processes expecting this property are aware of its possible presence or absence.

- **Temporary Workaround:**  
  The inline comment indicates that the solution is a temporary fix (workaround) with a planned update by the end of August. Future changes may affect how this extension operates.

- **Interaction with Other Extensions:**  
  Since this extension runs in the "Before Load Rules" scope, if other extensions modify `eventPayload.CanonicalDomain` or `CanonicalPath` after this script runs, it may lead to conflicts or unexpected behaviours.

---

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks:**  
  Even though eventType and eventPayload are guaranteed to exist, consider adding checks within any future modifications (if needed) in case properties like `CanonicalDomain` or `CanonicalPath` are not as expected.
  
- **Code Organisation:**  
  Wrap the logic in a well-named function to enhance readability and maintainability. Although the IIFE is straightforward, named functions can help with debugging and code clarity.

- **Modularisation:**  
  If additional conditions or domain-specific actions need to be supported in the future, consider using a configuration object or mapping to manage domain-specific behaviours cleanly.

- **Comments & Documentation:**  
  Update the inline comment (the workaround note) once the fix is implemented to prevent confusion for new maintainers.

- **Logging:**  
  Depending on the debugging and monitoring requirements, adding logging (e.g., using console.log) before and after key operations might help in tracing data transformations, especially in production scenarios.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Testing:**  
  Ensure that regression tests are in place for the canonical domain checks. Automated tests should validate both matching and non-matching scenarios to ensure consistent behaviour.

- **Ownership & Versioning:**  
  Document the owners and version history of this extension within your Tealium iQ project documentation. This aids in tracking changes and understanding the rationale behind the workaround.

- **Monitoring Future Updates:**  
  Keep track of the planned fix (scheduled for the end of August) and update the codebase following the removal of the temporary workaround. Ensure proper communication with any stakeholders affected by this change.

- **Code Reviews:**  
  Encourage periodic code reviews to ensure that any enhancements or refactoring align with the overall project guidelines and industry best practices.

- **Backup & Rollback Plans:**  
  Given the temporary nature of the workaround, ensure you have a plan to roll back the changes quickly in case of any unforeseen impacts during production rollout.
