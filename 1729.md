# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: Privacy Manager Version 3

## 1. Extension Overview
- **Name**: Privacy Manager Version 3
- **ID**: 1729
- **Type**: Javascript Code
- **Scope**: Pre Loader
- **Execution Frequency**: Run Once

### Summary
The Privacy Manager Version 3 extension facilitates user consent management for cookies and tracking technologies within a web application. It provides a clear interface for users to manage their preferences regarding essential, functional, performance, and targeting cookies. This extension enhances compliance with privacy regulations by ensuring that users can opt-in or opt-out of cookie usage, thereby reinforcing transparency and user trust.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- **window.LBGAnalytics**: This global object is expected to exist when the extension runs and contains relevant methods and properties related to analytics.
- **privacyObject**: The main object to hold the privacy manager functionalities, such as user consent status and actions related to cookie preferences.
- **cookies**: Utilises `LBGA.cookies`, representing the cookie management functionalities, if no cookies object is explicitly provided.
  
### Logic Flow
1. **Initialization**: The script verifies if `window.LBGAnalytics` is defined. It then sets up various cookie management functionalities.
2. **Wording and Consent Management**: The extension defines default messaging for cookie consent, consent status handlers, and actions (opt-in/opt-out).
3. **Cookie Management**: Different functions create cookies based on user actions regarding consent, including detailed logging of statuses and consent objects.
4. **UI Generation**: The extension dynamically creates a user interface (UI) for managing cookie preferences based on brand-specific skins and user interactions. It handles user actions like accepting, rejecting, or managing preferences for cookies.

### Global Dependencies
- `window.LBGAnalytics`: Requires this object to be available for accessing and setting cookies and event logging.
- **External Libraries**: Utilizes native JavaScript functionalities for creating, manipulating DOM elements, and handling events.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Sample Scenario 1: User Opts-In
1. A user visits the website.
2. A cookie consent banner appears, managed by the `displayPrivacyManager` function.
3. The user clicks “Accept all”.
4. The `optIn` method triggers, setting the cookies for full consent.

### Sample Scenario 2: User Opts-Out
1. A user visits the website.
2. The consent banner is displayed.
3. The user selects “Reject all”.
4. The `optOut` method is called, setting cookies to indicate an opt-out status.

### Edge Case: Query String Consent
- If the URL contains a specific query string (e.g., `LBGAc=`), the extension checks for pre-consent values and sets the consent cookie accordingly, handling scenarios where users navigate from other sites with pre-defined permissions.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas
- **Cookie Handling**: If the `LBGA.cookies` object is not available in a non-standard environment (e.g., strict privacy settings), the functionality may fail silently without fallback.
- **Cross-Domain Cookies**: The extension may encounter difficulties when attempting to set cookies across different domains/subdomains unless properly configured.
- **UI Dependencies**: The UI generated relies on the presence of specific HTML elements and styles; any changes to the document structure may result in rendering issues.

---

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring
- **Defensive Checks**: Implement additional error handling within functions (e.g., checking if required properties exist before accessing them).
- **Modularisation**: Consider refactoring large functions into smaller sub-functions to enhance readability and maintenance.
- **Commenting**: Improve inline comments to clarify the purpose of specific blocks of code, particularly within complex loops or functions.
- **Consistent Naming**: Maintain a consistent naming convention for functions and variables to indicate their purpose clearly, e.g., using descriptive names like `createCookieConsentSettings`.

---

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes
- **Ownership**: Designate a team or individual responsible for maintaining this extension to ensure it remains compliant with evolving privacy regulations.
- **Testing Guidelines**: Establish a testing protocol for new browsers and changes to underlying libraries or frameworks to ensure compatibility and functionality.
- **Version Tracking**: Keep track of version numbers and corresponding changes made to the wording and functionalities to properly manage consent records.
