## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Privacy Manager Version 3  
- **ID:** 1729  
- **Extension ID:** 100036  
- **Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** Pre Loader  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Once  

**Summary:**  
This extension implements an advanced privacy and cookie consent manager. It dynamically creates and displays a user interface on the webpage prompting visitors to consent to or reject cookies. The extension:
- Processes and writes consent cookies using pre-determined status codes (e.g. Full Consent, Confirmed Opt Out).
- Accounts for different cookie categories such as essential, functional, performance, and targeting.
- Adapts its appearance and behaviour based on pre-configured "skin" settings for different domains or brands.
- Integrates with the global LBGAnalytics object to record events and update the data layer.
- Handles query string parameters, inter-frame conditions (iframes vs. top windows), and incognito exceptions.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables and Constants

- **version:**  
  A constant string representing the wording version ("2.0") used for deriving the encoded version.

- **encodedVersion:**  
  Derived by converting the version number into a base-16 representation of its major and minor parts.

- **wordingHash:**  
  A hash generated from the sorted content of the privacy wording object. It is used to maintain consistency between cookie prompts and stored consents.

- **now:**  
  A timestamp (in seconds) representing the current time.

- **highestLevelDomain & subDomains:**  
  The extension retrieves the highest level domain from the cookies object (using `cookies.defaultDomain`) and computes a list of subdomains. This is later used to accurately set cookies across multiple subdomains.

- **Cookie Durations and Status Codes:**  
  - `cookieDurations` is a lookup for common cookie lifetimes (standard, long, and short durations).  
  - `statusCodes` is an object mapping different consent states (e.g. "y" for full consent, "n" for confirmed opt out, "u" for prompt not shown, etc.) to the corresponding cookie strings and consent object configurations.

- **Consent and Cookie Helper Functions:**  
  - `cookieString(…)`: Constructs a Tealium-compatible consent cookie string based on permitted categories.
  - `consentObject(…)`: Returns an object representing a user’s consent for each cookie category.
  - `setStatusCookie(…)`: Writes cookies based on a supplied status code. It applies multiple cookies (one at the root domain and short-lived ones on each subdomain) and also updates the global consent object on the LBGAnalytics object.

### Logic Flow and Data Processing

1. **Initial Checks and Window Functionality:**
   - The extension starts by confirming that `window.LBGAnalytics` and the related library `LBGAnalytics.el` are available.
   - A helper function `wipeWindowName()` is defined and called after user consent actions to clear potentially encoded information stored inside `window.name`.

2. **Privacy Manager Object and Immediate Function:**
   - An immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) is used to encapsulate the entire code logic while extending `window.LBGAnalytics.privacy`.
   - The IIFE receives `privacyObject`, `LBGA` (the main LBGAnalytics object), and optionally a cookies object.

3. **Cookie Handling:**
   - The extension constructs cookies which include a status code, timestamp, encoded version, and wording hash.
   - It checks for consent cookie information passed as a query string parameter (via "LBGAc=") to restore or update the user’s consent state.
   
4. **User Interaction and UI Rendering:**
   - The Privacy Manager dynamically creates a consent UI by utilising the `LBGAnalytics.el` component maker.
   - Multiple HTML elements are created (headers, paragraphs, buttons, etc.) styled via inline style objects built in ES5 syntax.
   - Event listeners are attached to buttons (Accept, Reject, Manage, Save, etc.) to trigger different consent actions using the helper functions (`optIn`, `optOut`, etc.).
   - The UI supports granular consent by allowing toggling of performance and targeting cookies separately.

5. **Skinning and Theming:**
   - A collection of “skins” is defined (e.g. for lloyds, mbna, bos, halifax, etc.). Each skin contains:
     - Font colour, family, border colour and button colour settings.
     - Overrides for button styles.
     - Specific cookie page URLs and incognito exceptions.
   - The function `applySkin(…)` is responsible for making the UI reflect the appropriate visual style based on the current domain.

6. **Initialisation Process:**
   - The extension checks if a valid cookie consent exists by decoding the "LBGc3" cookie using the provided algorithm.
   - Based on conditions such as URL paths (cookie pages), incognito usage, and marketing query strings, the Privacy Manager will either prompt the user or suppress the prompt.
   - Domain-specific logic then calls `privacyObject.init(…)` with the appropriate skin name to initialize the consent UI.

7. **Global Integration and Data Layer:**
   - The extension integrates with the LBGAnalytics events system to fire generic and cookie opt-in events.
   - A function is provided to update the global data layer (“CookieConsentData”) with encoded cookie consent information.

### Dependencies

- **Global Objects:**  
  - `window.LBGAnalytics`: Must be initialised and available.  
  - `LBGAnalytics.el`: A component maker used for DOM element creation.  
  - `LBGAnalytics.cookies`: Provides cookie reading and writing functions.  
  - `utag`: Used to fire tracking events (e.g. utag.view).

- **Browser Functions:**  
  - `atob()`: Used for decoding base64 encoded strings.
  - DOM API methods (e.g. `document.createElement`, `appendChild`, `querySelectorAll`).
  - Basic error handling via try/catch statements.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Normal Consent Flow
- **User Action:** A first-time visitor with no prior consent.
- **Flow:**  
  1. The `decodeCookie()` function returns no valid consent object.
  2. The extension calls `actions.promptCustomer()`.
  3. The Privacy Manager is displayed using the appropriate skin (e.g. "lloyds") for the current domain.
  4. The user clicks **Accept all**.
  5. Event listeners on the Accept button trigger `actions.optIn()`, which calls `setStatusCookie("y")` and fires generic tracking events.
  6. Consent cookies (with the "y" status code) are written across both the root and subdomains.
  
### Scenario 2: Rejected Consent Flow
- **User Action:** A returning visitor who decides to reject non-essential cookies.
- **Flow:**  
  1. If the visitor opts to **Reject all**, the `actions.optOut()` is invoked.
  2. `setStatusCookie("n")` is called, and a cookie representing the rejection state is set.
  3. Associated events (e.g. cookie opt-out events) are recorded consistently.
  4. The Privacy Manager UI hides after the action is completed.

### Scenario 3: URL Query String Consent
- **User Action:** The visitor accesses a page with a query string such as `?LBGAc=...`
- **Flow:**  
  1. The extension scans the URL for "LBGAc=".
  2. It decodes the consent parameters from the query string.
  3. Provided the cookie data is valid (timestamp is within acceptable bounds), the corresponding consent cookie is restored.
  4. Events are fired to indicate that the consent data has been stitched together.

### Scenario 4: Incognito Exception
- **User Action:** A visitor in an incognito window visits a page that has incognito exceptions defined.
- **Flow:**  
  1. The extension checks cookie age (in minutes) and incognito exceptions via skin configuration.
  2. If conditions match (e.g. time below 30 minutes and exception URL), the extension calls `actions.suppressPrompt()`.
  3. The Privacy Manager is suppressed without user prompt.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **IFrame Behaviour:**  
  - If the extension is run inside an iframe (not the top window), the prompt may be suppressed to trust the parent page. Developers need to ensure that iframe-managed pages pass consent information correctly.

- **Query String Parsing:**  
  - The logic to decode cookie data from the query string depends on the `atob()` functionality and strict URL formatting. Malformed query strings may lead to unpredictable states.

- **Domain and Subdomain Handling:**  
  - The algorithm for computing subdomains uses simple string splitting. If the domain structure is atypical or if there are custom TLDs, cookie setting may behave unexpectedly.

- **Timing Issues:**  
  - Delays in firing utag.view events (using nested setTimeout calls) may result in slight delays during UI transitions.

- **Dependency on Global Objects:**  
  - The extension assumes that `LBGAnalytics`, `LBGAnalytics.el`, and `LBGAnalytics.cookies` are present and correctly initialised. If these objects change or are delayed in loading, the extension may not function as expected.

- **External Assets:**  
  - The reliance on pre-defined skins and a global component maker may lead to conflicts if other Tealium or external scripts attempt to manipulate the same DOM elements or styles.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks and Error Handling:**  
  - Increase additional error handling around key DOM manipulations to log issues before failing silently.
  - Validate that all required properties on global objects (e.g. `LBGAnalytics.cookies`) are present before proceeding.

- **Modularisation:**  
  - Separate UI building logic into clearly defined functions or modules. For example, isolate the creation of cookie consent rows from the main display function.
  - Extract helper functions (e.g. version encoding, wording hash generation, cookie string creation) into a dedicated utility module.

- **Commenting and Readability:**  
  - Increase inline comments to explain transformations (e.g. encoding of version and generation of wording hash).
  - Consolidate repeated style objects or lookups into shared constants.

- **Consistent Use of ES5 Constructs:**  
  - Maintain all syntax in ES5, avoiding arrow functions, template literals, let/const, etc. Ensure that any new code adheres to ES5 standards for compatibility.
  - Use function declarations rather than inline anonymous functions where possible to improve stack traces in error logging.

- **Event Firing & Timeout Handling:**  
  - Review the nested setTimeout calls to ensure the utag.view event is fired at the correct time without unnecessary delays.
  - Ensure that event listeners are correctly removed if the UI is dismissed early.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  - Developers should verify that any updates to the global `LBGAnalytics` object or its sub-components remain backward compatible with this extension.
  - Regularly review URL and domain handling logic as website architecture or the marketing domain strategy evolves.

- **Ownership and Testing:**  
  - Assign a dedicated team or individual as the owner of the Privacy Manager code for periodic reviews and testing.
  - Implement a robust testing strategy with unit tests for helper functions (e.g. cookie decoding, version encoding) preferably using a testing framework that supports ES5.
  - Manual UI testing should be performed in various environments (e.g. different browsers, incognito mode, iframes) to verify that the prompt appears as intended and that cookies are correctly set.

- **Documentation and Change Logging:**  
  - Maintain a detailed changelog for future refactoring or version updates to the wording and consent logic.
  - Document any brand-specific skin changes explicitly so future developers know which elements are overridden per skin.

- **Integration with Tealium:**  
  - Ensure configuration in Tealium iQ remains in sync with updates made to this extension.  
  - Monitor interactions with other extensions in Tealium which might affect global objects (e.g. additional consent scripts) to prevent conflicts.
