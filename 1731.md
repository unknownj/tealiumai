# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: Embark Webchat Override

## Extension Overview
- **Name**: Embark Webchat Override
- **ID**: 1731
- **Type**: Javascript Code
- **Scope**: Before Load Rules
- **Execution Frequency**: Run Always

### Summary
The "Embark Webchat Override" extension is designed to modify the webchat platform configuration for specific domains. When accessed from certain predefined domains (associated with Lloyds Bank's digital wealth services), it sets the `WebchatPlatformOverride` variable to "Embark", ensuring that users on those domains receive the appropriate chat interface.

## Code Explanation
The extension consists of an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) that performs the following:

1. **Key Variables**:
   - `testDomains`: An array containing the hostnames of domains where the override should be applied.
   - `window.location.hostname`: Used to obtain the current hostname of the window.

2. **Logic Flow**:
   - The function checks if the `window.location.hostname` is included in the `testDomains` array:
     - If there is a match (the current hostname is in the list), it sets the global variable `b.WebchatPlatformOverride` to "Embark".
  
3. **Dependencies**:
   - The code relies on the existence of the global objects `eventType` and `eventPayload`, which are passed into the function when it is executed. No external libraries are required.

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Standard Use Case
When the user visits `put02-dlp-secure.digital.wealth.lloydsbank.co.uk`, the following occurs:
- The `window.location.hostname` evaluates to `put02-dlp-secure.digital.wealth.lloydsbank.co.uk`.
- The code identifies a match within `testDomains`.
- The extension sets `b.WebchatPlatformOverride` to "Embark".

### Example 2: Domain Not in List
For a visit to `www.example.com`, the execution will proceed as follows:
- The code evaluates the current hostname and finds no match in the `testDomains`.
- As a result, `b.WebchatPlatformOverride` remains undefined or unaffected.

### Edge Condition
Accessing the extension from a subdomain, e.g., `subdomain.put02-dlp-secure.digital.wealth.lloydsbank.co.uk`, will not trigger the override since the hostname must match exactly with one of the entries in `testDomains`.

## Known Limitations & Gotchas
- **Domain Matching**: The extension is strict in its hostname checks. Any variation (e.g., different subdomains or typos) will not activate the override, which might require manual updates to include new domains as needed.
- **Global Variables**: Potential conflicts may arise if other scripts also attempt to modify `b.WebchatPlatformOverride`, leading to unexpected behaviour.
- **Environmental Configuration**: Testing in non-production environments may yield different results if the test domains are not correctly implemented.

## Recommendations for Refactoring
- **Modularisation**: Consider abstracting the domain list into a separate function or object to enhance readability and maintainability.
- **Error Handling**: Implement logical checks before manipulating global variables to prevent unintentional overwrites. For instance, considering checking if `b` is defined before assignment could prevent runtime errors.
- **Documentation Comments**: Adding inline documentation within the code will enhance maintainability and allow future developers to understand the purpose of specific lines or blocks easily.

## Maintenance & Further Notes
- **Ongoing Maintenance**: Regularly review the `testDomains` array to ensure it stays up-to-date with any new or deprecated domains as part of the project lifecycle.
- **Ownership**: Assign ownership of the extension to a specific developer or team responsible for testing and updates.
- **Testing Guidelines**: Ensure thorough testing is performed in multiple environments (development, staging, production) to validate functionality under all expected conditions.
