# Embark Webchat Override Extension Documentation

This document provides a detailed overview and explanation of the "Embark Webchat Override" extension used in Tealium iQ. It is designed for developers and stakeholders to understand the implementation, usage, and maintenance aspects of the extension.

---

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Embark Webchat Override  
- **ID:** 1731  
- **Extension Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** Before Load Rules  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Always  

**Summary:**  
This extension is deployed to override the default webchat platform setting on specific test domains. When the page is loaded on any of the predefined test domains, this extension sets the global variable "WebchatPlatformOverride" to "Embark". This ensures that the webchat feature uses the Embark platform for those domains, likely for testing or specific customer configurations.

---

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- **testDomains:**  
  An array containing strings that represent the valid hostnames where the override should be applied. These are the test domains that have been defined as part of the extension configuration.

- **Global Variable (WebchatPlatformOverride):**  
  A property added to the global object represented by the second parameter (`eventPayload` in the code) that holds the value "Embark" when the current hostname matches one of the values in the `testDomains` array.

### Logic Flow
1. **Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE):**  
   The code is self-contained inside an IIFE that accepts two parameters (`a` and `b`), which in the context of Tealium are mapped to `eventType` and `eventPayload`.

2. **Test Domains Check:**
   - The variable `testDomains` is declared and initialised with a list of four domain strings.
   - The code checks if the current page's hostname (`window.location.hostname`) exists in the `testDomains` array using the `indexOf` method.
   - If the hostname is found (i.e. `indexOf` returns a value greater than or equal to 0), then the override is applied.

3. **Setting the Override:**
   - Upon a successful match, the code assigns the string "Embark" to the `WebchatPlatformOverride` property of the second parameter `b`.

### Dependencies on Global Objects or Libraries
- **window.location.hostname:**  
  The code directly accesses the `window.location` object to retrieve the current hostname.  
- **Global Object for Override:**  
  The extension assumes that the `eventPayload` (aliased to `b` in the IIFE) is a global object which is mutable and used elsewhere within the Tealium implementation to customise the webchat behaviour.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Condition
- **Scenario:**  
  A user accesses the website from `put08-dlp-secure.digital.wealth.lloydsbank.co.uk`.
  
- **Data Flow:**
  1. The IIFE is executed.
  2. `window.location.hostname` returns "put08-dlp-secure.digital.wealth.lloydsbank.co.uk".
  3. The domain is found in the `testDomains` array.
  4. The code sets `eventPayload.WebchatPlatformOverride = "Embark"`.
  
- **Outcome:**  
  The webchat in the application is forced to use the "Embark" platform.

### Edge Condition
- **Scenario:**  
  A user accesses the website from a domain NOT included in the `testDomains` list, such as "production.digital.example.com".

- **Data Flow:**
  1. The IIFE is executed.
  2. `window.location.hostname` returns "production.digital.example.com".
  3. Domain is not found in the `testDomains` array.
  4. No changes are made to the `eventPayload` object.
  
- **Outcome:**  
  The webchat platform remains in its default state, and no override occurs.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Domain Matching:**  
  The extension uses a simple index check on the testDomains array. If the test domains change or new domains need to be supported, they have to be manually added to the array.

- **Global Namespace Dependency:**  
  The code directly manipulates a global object (`eventPayload`). Conflicts can occur if other scripts modify the same property without coordination.

- **No Fallback Logic:**  
  There is no alternative logic if the domain match fails or if there is an error accessing the hostname. This could lead to unexpected behaviours if other parts of the system rely on the presence of the override property.

- **Ordering Dependencies:**  
  Since the extension is set to run "Before Load Rules", any later changes to webchat configurations might override this setting if not carefully managed.

---

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks for Domain Data:**  
  While it is guaranteed that `eventType` and `eventPayload` will be present, consider adding additional checks or logging for unexpected conditions (e.g. if `window.location` or `window.location.hostname` cannot be accessed).

- **Modularisation:**  
  If the list of domains expands or requires complex logic, consider abstracting the domain check into a separate function for better readability and maintainability.

- **Configuration Management:**  
  Instead of hardcoding the test domains in the extension code, consider managing these via a configuration file or external data source if supported by the Tealium environment. This can reduce the need for code changes when the domains list updates.

- **Code Comments:**  
  Include inline comments to explain the purpose of key operations. This aids in future maintenance and helps onboard new developers.

- **Logging:**  
  Add logging (if permitted within the production environment) to capture when the override is applied. This can aid in debugging and monitoring the behaviour of the extension.

*Note: The above recommendations adhere to ES5 constraints (i.e. usage of the var keyword and function expressions only).*

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ownership:**  
  Assign a specific team or developer to monitor and update this extension when changes to the test domains or webchat configuration occur.

- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Regularly test the extension across all supported domains (both test and production) to ensure the override behaves as expected.
  - Automate tests in a staging environment that simulate various hostname conditions.
  - Monitor for conflicts with other Tealium extensions, especially those that might alter the same global variables or configuration objects.

- **Documentation Updates:**  
  Maintain this documentation file in version control alongside the code. Update it whenever changes are made to the extension logic, configuration data, or environment conditions.

- **Change Management:**  
  Employ a review process for any modifications to the extension. Ensure that all changes are tested in a development or staging environment before being deployed to production.

This comprehensive documentation should serve as a clear guide for current and future developers interacting with the "Embark Webchat Override" extension in Tealium iQ.
