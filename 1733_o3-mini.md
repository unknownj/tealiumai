# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation – Component Library

This documentation covers detailed information for the Component Library extension. It explains its purpose, code flow, usage scenarios, limitations and gotchas, recommendations for potential improvements, and notes for ongoing maintenance.

---

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Component Library  
- **Extension ID:** 1733 (Tealium iQ internal extension ID)  
- **Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** Pre Loader  
- **Occurrence:** Run Once  

**Summary:**  
This extension establishes a component library within the Tealium iQ environment by creating a global helper object (`LBGAnalytics.el`) if the `LBGAnalytics` object is present on the page. Its primary purpose is to provide a set of functions to create and manipulate DOM elements dynamically. The extension features the following key functions:  
- Creating elements based on a CSS-like selector string  
- Adding classes, IDs, attributes and styles via a unified approach  
- Handling text and child nodes for the created elements  
- Providing a method to create SVG elements via the namespace option  

---

## 2. Code Explanation

### Global Dependencies and Initial Checks

- **Global Check:**  
  The code first checks if the global object `window.LBGAnalytics` exists. If so, it ensures that `LBGAnalytics.featureFlags` is initialised before attaching additional methods.  
  ```js
  if(window.LBGAnalytics){
    window.LBGAnalytics.featureFlags = window.LBGAnalytics.featureFlags || {};
  }
  ```

- **Attachment of the Component Library:**  
  The extension attaches a property `el` to the `LBGAnalytics` object if it exists. This object contains multiple utility methods for element creation.
  ```js
  if(window.LBGAnalytics) LBGAnalytics.el = (function () { ... })();
  ```

### Key Variables and Methods

- **el Object:**  
  This is a container object for the helper functions:
  - **_make(selector, optionalDescendants, optionalStyleObject, optionalNamespace):**  
    The core function that handles element creation.
    - **Input Parameters:**  
      - `selector`: A string (or an object) that resembles a CSS selector (e.g. "div#id.class[attr=value]").  
      - `optionalDescendants`: Can be a string (text content), an object (HTML fragment) or child elements.  
      - `optionalStyleObject`: A style object or an array of style objects that apply inline styles.  
      - `optionalNamespace`: (Optional) When provided, creates an element using the specified XML namespace (useful for SVG).

    - **Internal Steps:**  
      1. **Parsing the Selector:**  
         The function splits the provided selector into individual characters and iterates through them to segregate the element's type, id, classes, and attributes.  
         - Uses a state variable (`currentlyUpdating`) to keep track of which part of the element definition is being populated.
      
      2. **Element Creation:**  
         Depending on the presence of a namespace, it uses either `document.createElementNS` or `document.createElement`.  
         The parsed structure (`elementDefinition`) is stored on the created element as a custom property.
      
      3. **Applying Classes and Attributes:**  
         Loops through the `classList` and `attributeList` derived from the selector to add classes and attributes to the element.
      
      4. **Applying Inline Styles:**  
         Merges provided style objects (if any) and applies each style rule to the element.
      
      5. **Appending Text and Children:**  
         - If text is provided (as string or via an object with an `html` property), it appends text nodes or sets the `innerHTML` accordingly.
         - If valid child elements are provided, they are appended to the created element.

  - **make(selector, optionalDescendants, optionalStyleObject):**  
    A wrapper method for the `_make` function (without the namespace parameter).  
    Example use: Creating a standard HTML element.
  
  - **draw(selector, optionalText, optionalStyleObject):**  
    Another wrapper for `_make` that enforces SVG element creation by providing a standard SVG namespace URL.  
    Example use: Creating an SVG element.
  
  - **text(value):**  
    A simple utility for creating a text node from a string.

### Logic Flow Summary

1. **Initialisation:**  
   The extension checks for `window.LBGAnalytics` and then attaches the `el` object.

2. **Parsing and Element Creation:**  
   The `_make` function handles the parsing of a CSS-style selector string. It dynamically creates an element, assigns IDs, classes, and attributes, and then applies styles and appends content if provided.

3. **Namespace Handling:**  
   When a namespace is provided (as in the `draw` method), the function uses `document.createElementNS` to correctly create elements in an SVG context.

4. **Return:**  
   Ultimately, the newly created element is returned to whichever code invoked the method.

### Dependencies

- **Global Object:**  
  The code assumes the existence of `window.LBGAnalytics`. All methods attach themselves to this object.
- **DOM API:**  
  Heavily relies on standard DOM methods like `document.createElement`, `createElementNS`, `appendChild`, and manipulation of an element's `classList` and `style`.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Example 1: Standard HTML Element Creation

E.g. Creating a simple `div` element with an ID, class, and text content:

```js
// Create a div element with ID "myDiv", class "container", and text "Hello World"
var myDiv = LBGAnalytics.el.make("div#myDiv.container", "Hello World", { color: "blue", fontSize: "14px" });
document.body.appendChild(myDiv);
```

**Explanation:**  
- The selector "div#myDiv.container" is parsed into:
  - Element Type: "div"
  - ID: "myDiv"
  - Class: "container"
- Text content "Hello World" is added as a text node.
- Inline styles such as color and font size are applied.

### Example 2: Creating an SVG Element

E.g. Creating an SVG rectangle element:

```js
// Using draw to create an SVG element - note an SVG element may need additional attributes
var svgRect = LBGAnalytics.el.draw("rect#myRectangle.class1", { html: "<!-- optional inner HTML for svg -->" }, { fill: "red", stroke: "black" });
// Appending into an existing SVG element container:
var svgContainer = document.getElementById('svgContainer');
if (svgContainer) {
  svgContainer.appendChild(svgRect);
}
```

**Explanation:**  
- The `draw` method is used to create an SVG element by passing an SVG-relevant namespace.
- The selector "rect#myRectangle.class1" creates a rectangle with a specified ID and class.
- Inline styles for fill and stroke are applied.
- Optionally, inner HTML might be set through the text parameter if provided as an object.

### Example 3: Edge Conditions

- **When an Object is Passed as Selector:**  
  The code handles an object input by extracting properties such as `text`, `children`, `style`, and `selector`:
  ```js
  var myComplexElement = LBGAnalytics.el.make({
    selector: "span.highlight",
    text: "Highlighted Text",
    style: { backgroundColor: "yellow" },
    children: [document.createElement("br")]
  });
  ```
- **Handling Missing Optional Parameters:**  
  If optional descendants or style objects are not provided, the defaults (i.e. empty text or style) ensure the element is still created without errors.

---

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Parsing Simplicity:**  
  The manual parsing of the selector string is rudimentary. Complex selectors (with multiple classes, attributes with complex values, or nested selectors) might not be fully supported or may lead to unexpected results.
  
- **Inline HTML Handling:**  
  If the optional text parameter is provided as an object with an `html` property, the innerHTML is directly set. This approach (“// yucky…”) may lead to security issues (if not sanitised) or rendering problems.
  
- **Non-Standard Attributes:**  
  The attribute parsing only splits attribute strings on “=”. Attributes that do not follow the simple "key=value" format or those with spaces/quotes might be misinterpreted.
  
- **Namespace Handling:**  
  The fallback to create an HTML element when a namespace is not provided is acceptable; however, making further DOM manipulations might be tricky if the expected element type is inconsistent.

- **Potential Conflicts:**  
  Since this extension attaches properties (`el`) to `LBGAnalytics`, if other extensions or scripts modify or override this object, it may result in conflicts. Moreover, if multiple extension instances run in an unexpected order, the “Run Once” occurrence might lead to incomplete initialisation.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks:**  
  Although some checks are present (e.g. verifying the existence of `LBGAnalytics`), consider adding more robust type and existence checks while parsing the selector string.
  
- **Parsing Enhancements:**  
  Instead of splitting the selector into single characters, leverage a more formal parsing mechanism (while still adhering to ES5) to better support complex selectors.
  
- **Separation of Concerns:**  
  - Modularise the parsing logic into helper functions.  
  - Separate the concerns of creating elements, setting attributes, applying styles, and appending content to keep the code more maintainable.
  
- **Documentation and Comments:**  
  Expand inline comments to explain non-obvious logic sections. This will aid future developers who maintain the code.
  
- **Error Handling:**  
  Introduce error handling or logging (for instance, when an unsupported format is encountered or when DOM methods fail) so that issues can be more easily diagnosed at runtime.

- **Security Considerations:**  
  Avoid using innerHTML with unsanitised input. Even if the application context guarantees the safety of input, future use cases might benefit from stricter handling.

*Note:* Despite suggestions above, remember that the extension must remain ES5 compatible; therefore, do not include ES6 features such as let/const, arrow functions, or template literals.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  - Assign an owner or team responsible for monitoring global objects like `LBGAnalytics` to ensure compatibility with other Tealium extensions or scripts.  
  - Include this documentation alongside the code in your version control system to simplify future audits and enhancements.
  
- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Implement unit tests around the `_make` function to cover a range of inputs including complex selectors and edge cases.  
  - Perform regression testing whenever changes are made to ensure no unintended side effects occur on element creation.
  
- **Code Ownership:**  
  Maintain a clear history of changes (via Git commit messages or a changelog) so that any refactoring or modifications are well documented.  
  Ensure that the testing strategy covers both standard and edge conditions for DOM element creation.

- **Stakeholder Communication:**  
  Share this documentation with both developers and non-technical stakeholders to provide context on the extension’s functionality, dependencies, and potential risks. Regular reviews are recommended to update the documentation as the system evolves.
