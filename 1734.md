# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: Cross-Tag PageViewID

## 1. Extension Overview
- **Name:** Cross-Tag PageViewID
- **ID:** 1734
- **Type:** JavaScript Code
- **Scope:** After Load Rules
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Always

### Summary
The Cross-Tag PageViewID extension generates a unique identifier for each page view when the page is accessed. It ensures that the `PageViewID` is stored in the global data layer, making it available for subsequent tracking or analytics purposes across different tags. This is crucial for maintaining session coherence and enabling better understanding of user interactions.

## 2. Code Explanation
### Key Variables
- `a`: Represents the event type, though it is not explicitly used in the code.
- `b`: Represents the event payload (an object), passed into the IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression).

### Logic Flow
1. The function checks if the `PageViewID` does not already exist in the `eventPayload` (object `b`).
2. If `PageViewID` is absent, it generates a new unique identifier by:
   - Combining the current timestamp (in base-36) with a random number (also in base-36).
3. The function then attempts to store this `PageViewID` in the relevant global data layer:
   - If `LBGAnalytics` is present and has a `datalayer`, it sets the `PageViewID` there.
   - If `clova3` is present and has a `datalayer`, it sets the `PageViewID` there as well.

### Dependencies
- The extension relies on the existence of global objects `window.LBGAnalytics` and `window.clova3`. The behaviour of this extension can vary based on the presence or absence of these objects.

## 3. Usage Examples
### Normal Scenario
- When a user visits a page, the extension runs and checks if the `PageViewID` is present.
- If it is not, it creates a new `PageViewID` and logs it in the appropriate data layer (LBG or Clova).
- This identifier can now be used in downstream tags for tracking purposes.

### Edge Conditions
- If both `window.LBGAnalytics` and `window.clova3` are not present, the `PageViewID` would be generated but not stored anywhere. This could lead to difficulties in tracking page views accurately.
- If a user navigates back to the same page (same session), the `PageViewID` may remain unchanged if present, which is intended.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas
- Failure to detect or interact with both `LBGAnalytics` and `clova3` potentially undermines the purpose of the extension. If neither is present, the identifier will not be recorded anywhere.
- Other extensions or scripts that modify the global data layer or that manipulate the scope in which this extension runs could potentially conflict and lead to unexpected results.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring
- **Consider adding logging:** Implementing basic logging could aid in troubleshooting in cases where neither data layer is available.
- **Modularize logic:** If the environment allows for better separation of concerns, consider breaking out the ID generation and data layer assignment into separate functions, enhancing readability.
- **Remove hard-coded dependencies:** Although current dependencies on `LBGAnalytics` and `clova3` are necessary, identifying an ideal way to handle situations when neither is available could be beneficial for future iterations.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes
- **Ongoing Maintenance:** Regularly test the extension to ensure it works correctly with the latest site deployments and tag management configurations.
- **Ownership:** Designate a responsible party for updates and improvements, ensuring the extension remains aligned with evolving tracking requirements.
- **Testing Guidelines:** Create unit tests to validate that the `PageViewID` is correctly generated and assigned under various scenarios, particularly focusing on the presence or absence of required global objects.
