# Cross-Tag PageViewID Extension Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive overview and explanation of the "Cross-Tag PageViewID" Tealium iQ extension. It covers the extension's purpose, how it works, usage examples, known limitations, refactoring recommendations, and maintenance notes.

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Cross-Tag PageViewID  
- **ID:** 1734  
- **Extension Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** After Load Rules  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Always  

**Summary:**  
This extension generates a unique PageViewID for each page load. It utilises the current timestamp and a random number, both converted to string representations, to produce an ID that is (likely) unique for each page view. The generated PageViewID is then set into the data layer for two potential global objects (LBGAnalytics and clova3) if they are present. This mechanism enables cross-tagging and correlation of page views in downstream analytics and tracking processes.

## 2. Code Explanation

The extension's logic is wrapped in an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) that accepts two parameters, namely `eventType` and `eventPayload`. The following details explain the key variables and logic flow:

- **Global Dependency Checks:**  
  The code checks if a property named `PageViewID` exists on the `eventPayload` object. This ensures that a PageViewID is generated only once per page load.

- **Key Variables and Generation Logic:**  
  - `b.PageViewID`: This property is assigned on the `eventPayload` object (`b`) if it does not already exist.  
  - The ID generation uses the current date/time by calling `(new Date()).getTime()`, converting this numeric value to a base-36 string.  
  - `Math.random()` is used to produce a random fractional value and is also converted to a base-36 string. All periods are removed from the random string by using `.split(".").join("")`.
  
- **Data Layer Integration:**  
  - If the global object `LBGAnalytics` exists and it contains a `datalayer`, the extension sets the generated `PageViewID` on that data layer using `LBGAnalytics.datalayer.set("PageViewID", b.PageViewID)`.
  - If `LBGAnalytics` is not present, it checks for another global object, `clova3`, that may also have its own `datalayer`. If found, the PageViewID is similarly set using `clova3.datalayer.set("PageViewID", b.PageViewID)`.

- **Dependencies:**  
  - The extension depends on the existence of global objects `LBGAnalytics` and/or `clova3` to push data into their respective data layers.  
  - The base functionality (date/time and math random) is available in all standard ES5 environments.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Flow Example

1. **Scenario:**  
   A user navigates to a page where this extension is executed.
   
2. **Data Flow:**  
   - The extension checks if `eventPayload.PageViewID` exists.  
   - Since it does not, it generates a new PageViewID (e.g., "l1k2def7abc...").  
   - The generated ID is set into `eventPayload.PageViewID`.
   - If either `LBGAnalytics.datalayer` or `clova3.datalayer` exists, the extension calls the `set` method on the data layer, making the PageViewID available for subsequent tracking operations.

### Edge Condition Example

1. **Scenario:**  
   The extension is executed on a page where a PageViewID has already been assigned earlier in the page lifecycle.
   
2. **Data Flow:**  
   - On re-execution, the `if (!eventPayload.PageViewID)` condition will fail because the ID already exists.  
   - No new PageViewID is generated, ensuring the integrity of the ID across multiple extensions or executions.

### Absence of Global Data Layers

1. **Scenario:**  
   Neither `LBGAnalytics` nor `clova3` is present in the global scope.
   
2. **Data Flow:**  
   - The extension still assigns a new PageViewID to `eventPayload.PageViewID`.  
   - The conditional blocks for setting the PageViewID on a data layer are bypassed, and no errors are thrown because the code correctly checks for the existence of each object before invocation.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Single Instance Generation:**  
  - The extension relies solely on the fact that `eventPayload.PageViewID` is not already defined. If another extension creates or modifies this value, it may lead to unexpected behaviours or bypass the unique ID generation.

- **Global Object Dependency:**  
  - The functionality to set the PageViewID into a data layer is contingent upon the presence of either `LBGAnalytics.datalayer` or `clova3.datalayer`. In a scenario where both are unavailable or misconfigured, the ID generated will not be pushed to any data layer.

- **Potential Conflicts:**  
  - If multiple similar extensions are used that generate and assign a PageViewID, conflicts could occur. The extension does not include any namespacing or conflict resolution mechanisms.

- **Assumption on Parameter Types:**  
  - The extension assumes that `eventType` and `eventPayload` are provided; while this is guaranteed in the current context, any future changes that affect these assumptions could break the functionality.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Modularisation:**  
  - Although the current IIFE pattern is acceptable in ES5, consider splitting the logic into smaller, well-defined functions for readability. For example, a separate function to generate the ID and another to assign it to data layers might improve maintainability.
  
- **Error Handling:**  
  - While defensive coding for `eventType` and `eventPayload` is not required, additional error handling around the external data layers (e.g. checking if `set` is a function) can provide more robustness.
  
- **Code Comments:**  
  - Include inline comments explaining the purpose of each block of code. This enhances readability, especially for developers new to the project.
  
- **Avoid Global Pollution:**  
  - Ensure that any variables defined are kept within the local scope of the IIFE to prevent accidental global namespace pollution.

- **Testing & Validation:**  
  - Implement unit tests (using any ES5-supported testing framework) to verify that the PageViewID is generated correctly and that it is only assigned once per page load.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  - Regularly review the extension against upcoming changes in the Tealium iQ platform or the global objects (`LBGAnalytics`, `clova3`) to maintain compatibility.
  - Document any changes or dependency modifications in a change log within the repository or shared documentation space.
  
- **Ownership & Code Reviews:**  
  - Assign a dedicated owner for the extension responsible for periodic reviews and updates.
  - Conduct code reviews with a focus on ES5 compatibility to ensure that newer JavaScript features are not inadvertently introduced.

- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Create automated tests to simulate various scenarios, including normal execution, execution when the ID already exists, and when the global data layer objects are not available.
  - Perform regression testing whenever changes are made to ensure that the core functionality of setting a unique PageViewID remains intact.

- **Documentation Updates:**  
  - Keep this documentation in sync with any changes to the code or its dependencies. A version-controlled documentation file (e.g. within a GitHub repository) is recommended.
