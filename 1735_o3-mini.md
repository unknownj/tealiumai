# Global Virtual Assistant Controller Extension Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the "Global Virtual Assistant Controller" Tealium iQ extension. It covers the extension’s purpose, the internal code logic, examples of usage, known limitations, recommendations for refactoring, and maintenance notes.

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Global Virtual Assistant Controller  
- **ID:** 1735 (Extension), 100036 (Library-level reference)  
- **Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** Before Load Rules  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Always

**Summary:**  
This extension is designed to control and configure the virtual assistant experience on a website based on specific conditions related to the current URL (i.e. the hostname and pathname). It cycles through a list of pre-defined assistant configurations and applies the appropriate configuration and name to the data layer object (via eventPayload, here represented as "b") when the user navigates on pages that match specific criteria. This approach enables dynamic adjustments to virtual assistance depending on the current web environment.

---

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables and Structures

- **assistants (Array):**  
  This array contains objects representing different virtual assistant configurations. Each object includes:
  - **name:** A descriptive name for the virtual assistant configuration.
  - **config:** A string identifier used by the virtual assistant system.
  - **criteria:** A function that accepts a data layer object (here referenced as "dl") and returns a Boolean value depending on whether the current URL meets the criteria.

- **eventType and eventPayload (Function Arguments):**  
  These external parameters (passed to the main IIFE) are used to pass in global event type and payload (data layer) objects. The payload ("b") is where the determined virtual assistant configurations are ultimately set if the criteria match.

### Logic Flow

1. **Definition of Assistants:**  
   The extension creates an array called `assistants` containing one active object (others are commented out). The active object pertains to "Intermediaries", and it specifies:
   - Its configuration string ("askus.halifax-intermediaries.co.uk:halifaxintermediairies_live_emb").
   - A criteria function that checks if the current hostname contains the string "halifax-intermediaries" and if the pathname matches specific exact values (e.g. "/", "/products.html", etc.).

2. **Iteration and Evaluation:**  
   The extension loops through each assistant in the `assistants` array using the `forEach` method. For each assistant:
   - The criteria function is called with the data layer object.
   - If the criteria returns true (i.e. the current window location matches the set conditions), then the extension sets:
     - `b.VirtualAssistantConfig` to the assistant's configuration string.
     - `b.VirtualAssistantName` to the assistant's name.
   This ensures that only one (the matching) virtual assistant configuration is applied based on the site context.

3. **Global Object Dependencies:**
   - The code depends on the global `window` object to check the current hostname and pathname.
   - It relies on the provided `eventType` and `eventPayload` variables being available in the global scope or passed into the extension.

### Dependencies on Global Objects or Libraries

- **window.location:**  
  The extension uses `window.location.hostname` and `window.location.pathname` to determine whether the current page qualifies for a particular virtual assistant configuration.

- **Data Layer Object (eventPayload "b"):**  
  The code assumes that this object is available and mutable, and it attaches configuration properties directly to it.

---

## 3. Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Matching the "Intermediaries" Assistant

- **Condition:**  
  - The current hostname includes the substring "halifax-intermediaries".
  - The current pathname is exactly one of the following: "/", "/products.html", "/criteria.html", "/tools-calculators.html", "/contact.html", or "/placing-business/product-transfers-and-further-advances.html".
  
- **Flow:**  
  - The criteria function in the "Intermediaries" object evaluates to true.
  - The extension sets:
    - `b.VirtualAssistantConfig = "askus.halifax-intermediaries.co.uk:halifaxintermediairies_live_emb"`
    - `b.VirtualAssistantName = "Intermediaries"`

- **Result:**  
  The virtual assistant configuration is applied accordingly, and any downstream processes that rely on these values will now use the "Intermediaries" configuration.

### Scenario 2: No Matching Criteria

- **Condition:**  
  - The current hostname does not include "halifax-intermediaries", or the pathname does not match any of the specified pages.
  
- **Flow:**  
  - The criteria function returns either false or undefined because none of the conditions are met.
  - The iteration completes without setting the `VirtualAssistantConfig` or `VirtualAssistantName` on the data layer object.
  
- **Result:**  
  No virtual assistant configuration is applied. Downstream logic that depends on these properties may either fall back to defaults or simply not render the assistant.

### Edge Considerations

- **Multiple Conditions (Future Scenario):**  
  Although only one assistant configuration is active in this version, the structure allows for multiple assistants. Note that once a criteria matches, subsequent configurations are still evaluated but can override previously set values if not handled carefully.

- **Commented-Out Assistants:**  
  In this code, several assistant configurations have been commented out. When uncommented, each will be processed similarly, meaning careful ordering and non-overlapping criteria should be maintained to avoid conflicts.

---

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Single Matching Assistant:**  
  The extension does not short-circuit once a match is found. All definitions in the array are iterated. If multiple objects’ criteria return true, the last one in the array overwrites earlier assignments. This may cause unintended conflicts if overlapping conditions exist.

- **Reliance on URL Structure:**  
  Since the extension depends on `window.location.hostname` and `window.location.pathname`, any changes to the site’s URL structure or hostnames might lead to failures in recognising the appropriate virtual assistant configuration.

- **Commented Code:**  
  There is a large block of commented-out assistant definitions. This can lead to confusion during maintenance if it’s unclear what should be active versus legacy code.

- **Hardcoded Values:**  
  All domain names and pathnames are hardcoded. This requires manual updates if the website structure or domains change, increasing the risk of human error.

- **Conflict with Other Extensions:**  
  If other Tealium extensions modify `eventPayload` or depend on similarly named properties, there is a potential for conflicts. Always ensure that property names (like "VirtualAssistantConfig" and "VirtualAssistantName") are unique and do not collide with other implementations.

---

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Short-Circuit on First Match:**  
  Consider adding a mechanism to break out of the iteration once a valid assistant is found. This prevents later iterations from unintentionally overriding previously set values.  
  (Example: Use a simple for-loop with a break statement instead of forEach.)

- **Modularise Criteria Functions:**  
  Extract each criteria function into a separate, well-named function. This improves readability and promotes reuse.  
  (Note: Maintain ES5 syntax by using function declarations.)

- **Remove or Archive Commented Code:**  
  If the commented-out assistant definitions are no longer used, remove them from the main codebase or archive them in version control documentation to avoid confusion.

- **Cache window.location Properties:**  
  For performance and clarity, cache `window.location.hostname` and `window.location.pathname` in local variables at the beginning of the extension. This avoids repeated property lookups and clarifies intent.

- **Enhanced Logging (For Debug Purposes):**  
  Consider adding logging statements (using console.log or a similar mechanism) that capture when an assistant configuration is applied or when no match is found. Ensure that logging is removed or disabled in production if necessary.

- **Consistent Code Style:**  
  Maintain a consistent indentation, naming conventions, and commenting style throughout the extension to ease readability and maintenance.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Testing:**  
  Regularly test the extension across all target browsers, especially given the requirement to support ES5. Verify behaviour on all permitted domains and various pathnames to ensure that the correct configuration is applied.

- **Change Management:**  
  Document any changes to the list of assistants or criteria in a changelog. Ensure that updates to the URL structures or domain names are propagated to the assistant definitions promptly.

- **Ownership & Version Control:**  
  Assign a responsible team or individual for the virtual assistant configuration and its associated code. Use version control to track changes over time and perform code reviews before deployments.

- **Integration with Other Extensions:**  
  When deploying additional Tealium extensions, verify compatibility. Ensure that property names in the dataLayer (or eventPayload) do not create conflicts, particularly if multiple extensions interact with virtual assistant settings.

- **Future Enhancements:**  
  Should requirements evolve to allow multiple simultaneous configurations or more dynamic criteria (perhaps fetched from a server configuration), structure the code to be easily extendable with minimal disruptive changes.
