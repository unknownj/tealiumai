# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive overview and explanation of the "Workday Querystring Persistence" extension used in Tealium iQ. It details the extension’s functionality, code logic, usage scenarios, known limitations, refactoring suggestions, and maintenance recommendations.

---

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Workday Querystring Persistence  
- **ID:** 1736 (Extension ID: 100036)  
- **Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** 1495  
- **Execution Frequency:** Runs on page load (implied by immediately executing the self-invoking function)

**Summary:**  
This extension captures specific query string parameters (those beginning with "utm" or exactly "source") from the URL, persists them in a session cookie called "workday_utm", and then appends these parameters to hyperlinks on the page that link to a designated workday domain (lbg.wd3.myworkdayjobs.com), ensuring that tracked parameters persist across navigation. This is used primarily for tracking and attribution purposes in integration with Workday job listings and career pages.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables and Their Roles

- **relevantQuerystring:**  
  Extracts the querystring from the current URL (minus the leading "?"), transforms it to lowercase, splits it by "&", and builds an array of [key, value] pairs. It then filters these pairs for keys starting with "utm" or equal to "source", URL encodes the values, and finally joins them back into a string with "&" delimiters.

- **document.cookie:**  
  Used both to set the "workday_utm" session cookie, and later to retrieve it.

- **workday_utm:**  
  The value retrieved from the "workday_utm" cookie. If this cookie is not present, the extension ceases further processing.

- **workdayLinks & workdayLinksArray:**  
  Grabs all hyperlink (anchor) elements on the page and filters them, retaining only those whose href attribute contains the specified workday domain ("lbg.wd3.myworkdayjobs.com"). Additionally, it further checks if the URL has no existing querystring parameters or if it includes the substring "lbgcareerssite", adding these elements to a new array for further processing.

### Logic Flow

1. **Querystring Extraction and Processing:**  
   - The extension starts by retrieving the query string from the current page URL and standardises it (conversion to lowercase).
   - It then splits the query string into parameter pairs.
   - It filters these pairs to include only keys that start with "utm" or are exactly "source".
   - The values are encoded using `encodeURIComponent` to ensure URL safety.
   - The array of parameters is reassembled into a single query string.

2. **Cookie Storage:**  
   - If any relevant query string is found, it is persisted as a session cookie named "workday_utm" with a path of "/".

3. **Cookie Retrieval:**  
   - The extension retrieves the "workday_utm" cookie value by parsing `document.cookie`, splitting it into individual cookie entries, and filtering for the required key.

4. **Link Identification:**  
   - All `<a>` elements on the page are collected.
   - Each link’s href is inspected:
     - Must contain the workday domain "lbg.wd3.myworkdayjobs.com".
     - Must either not already have a query string or contain a specific substring ("lbgcareerssite").
   - The valid links are stored in the `workdayLinksArray`.

5. **Appending Querystring to Links:**  
   - For each link in the `workdayLinksArray`, any existing query string is removed (by splitting with "?") and replaced with one containing the stored query parameters from the cookie.

6. **Logging:**  
   - If a global object `LBGAnalytics` exists with a method `analyticsLog`, a log statement is issued indicating how many workday links were updated.

### Dependencies on Global Objects or Libraries

- **window.location:**  
  For capturing the current URL and its query string.

- **document.cookie:**  
  For setting and reading cookies.

- **document.getElementsByTagName:**  
  For accessing all hyperlink elements in the document.

- **LBGAnalytics:**  
  An assumed global object for logging analytics events. The code checks for its existence before logging.

- **Event parameters (`eventType`, `eventPayload`, `tagObject`):**  
  Passed into the self-invoking function, though they are not utilised within the extension code.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Flow Scenario

- **URL:**  
  User visits a page with a URL, e.g.,  
  `https://example.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&source=campaign`

- **Processing:**  
  - The code extracts "utm_source", "utm_medium", and "source" query parameters.
  - It creates and stores the string `utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&source=campaign` (after encoding) in the session cookie "workday_utm".
  - It then identifies any links on the page pointing to "lbg.wd3.myworkdayjobs.com" (and meeting the other criteria) and appends the query string to their hrefs.

- **Outcome:**  
  The user clicking on any of these links is taken to a URL that includes the original UTM parameters, ensuring that tracking information persists.

### Edge Conditions

- **No Relevant Query Parameters:**  
  If the page URL does not contain any parameters starting with "utm" or equal to "source", then no cookie will be set, and the extension’s subsequent processing (updating links) is skipped.

- **Missing Workday Links:**  
  If there are no hyperlinks that match the criteria related to the workday domain, the script terminates early without modifying any links.

- **Existing Query Parameters on Links:**  
  If a link already has query parameters (and does not include "lbgcareerssite" in its URL), it will ignore that link to avoid appending redundant or duplicate parameters.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Cookie Overwrite:**  
  The extension always overwrites the "workday_utm" cookie with the latest relevant querystring. This means if a user navigates to a new page with different UTM parameters during the same session, the previous data will be replaced.

- **Dependent on URL Format:**  
  The extraction logic relies on the querystring being well-formed and assumes that parameters are separated by "&". Malformed URLs might not be processed correctly.

- **Hard-coded Domain Check:**  
  The domain "lbg.wd3.myworkdayjobs.com" is hard-coded. If this domain changes or multiple domains need to be supported, code modifications are required.

- **Limited Query Parameter Filters:**  
  Only query string parameters beginning with "utm" or exactly matching "source" are processed. Other potential tracking parameters are ignored.

- **Potential Conflicts:**  
  Other Tealium extensions or external scripts that modify anchor tags or the document’s cookies might conflict with this extension, especially if they use the same cookie name ("workday_utm").

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks:**  
  - Although the presence of `eventType` and `eventPayload` is guaranteed, consider checking for the existence of other global objects (like `document.cookie` or `document.getElementsByTagName`) if integrating with other libraries or custom environments.
  
- **Code Style & Modularisation:**  
  - Refactor repetitive code segments into helper functions (e.g. a function for extracting a specific cookie or for updating a single link).
  - Include more meaningful variable names where possible to increase code readability.
  
- **Error Handling:**  
  - Incorporate error logging or fallbacks in cases where accessing or updating cookies throws exceptions.
  
- **Comments & Documentation:**  
  - Enhance inline code comments for ease of future maintenance and clarity on the purpose of each major code block.

- **Separation of Concerns:**  
  - Consider separating the querystring extraction, cookie operations, and link modifications into independent functions to allow unit testing and easier debugging.

**Note:**  
Do not use ES2015/ES6 constructs such as arrow functions, template literals, or block-scoped variables (let/const) to preserve compatibility with ES5.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  - Assign a dedicated owner or team to periodically review and update the extension code as underlying URL structures or domains change.
  - Use version control (e.g. Git) to manage changes and track issues.

- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Create test cases for both normal and edge scenarios:
    - With and without relevant querystring parameters.
    - Pages with dynamic content and various numbers of workday links.
    - Check behaviour when the cookie has expired or is deleted.
  
- **Monitoring & Logging:**  
  - Ensure that the logging mechanism (via `LBGAnalytics.analyticsLog`) is monitored to track how many links are updated and to identify any anomalies in the extension’s behaviour.
  - Consider integrating additional logging (if permitted) to capture errors related to cookie access or DOM manipulation.

- **Documentation:**  
  - Maintain this documentation alongside the code repository. Ensure that any changes to the extension are reflected in updates to this documentation.
  - Encourage peer reviews and knowledge sharing sessions to familiarise the team with the extension's workings.
