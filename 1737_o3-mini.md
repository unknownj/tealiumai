## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Password Complexity Measurement  
- **ID:** 1737 (Extension ID: 100036)  
- **Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** After Load Rules  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Always  

**Summary:**  
This extension is designed to measure the complexity of password input fields on a webpage. It scans for password inputs, applies a scoring algorithm based on password length and the inclusion of various character types (lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and special characters), and then sends a score to the analytics system via chained generic events. The extension is intended to provide insight into the quality of user passwords for purposes such as security analysis and compliance monitoring.

## 2. Code Explanation

The extension code is wrapped in an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) that takes two parameters (`eventType` and `eventPayload`), although these parameters are not used within the core logic.

### Key Steps in the Code

1. **Password Field Selection:**  
   - The code uses `document.querySelectorAll("input[type=password]")` to select all password input elements on the page.
   - `Array.from()` is used to convert the NodeList to an array for further processing.  
     **Note:** While `Array.from` is an ES6 feature, it is assumed to be polyfilled in the environment, as the final code must support ES5.

2. **Conditional Mapping Based on Input Count:**  
   - The first `.map` iterates over the array of inputs and checks if there is exactly one password field (`if (a.length === 1)`). If true, it returns the element; otherwise, it returns `undefined`.
   - This condition means that the extension is only intended to process the password field when exactly one exists, and it effectively ignores multiple password fields.

3. **Filtering Empty and Undefined Values:**  
   - The next `.filter` removes any falsy values (such as `undefined` caused by the conditional mapping).
   - A subsequent `.filter` ensures that only password fields with a non-empty value (`!!a.value`) are processed.

4. **Password Complexity Calculation:**  
   - Each qualifying password field’s value is passed through a `.map` function which computes a complexity score:
     - Increment score if password length is at least 8 characters.
     - Increment score if password length is at least 12 characters.
     - Increment score if password length is at least 16 characters.
     - Increment score for the presence of at least one lowercase letter (`/[a-z]/`).
     - Increment score for the presence of at least one uppercase letter (`/[A-Z]/`).
     - Increment score for the presence of at least one numeric digit (`/[0-9]/`).
     - Increment score for the presence of at least one special character (`/[!@#$%^&*()_+\-=\[\]{};':"\\|,.<>\/?]/`).

5. **Event Triggering:**  
   - The resulting score is then passed to a `.forEach` loop.
   - For each calculated score, two generic events are triggered by calling:
     
     LBGAnalytics.events.genericEvent(61, score).genericEvent(62)
     
     This chained call sends the password complexity score (with event code 61) and follows it with a second event (with code 62).

### Global Dependencies

- **Document Object:** The code heavily relies on the browser’s `document` object to access DOM elements.
- **LBGAnalytics Global Object:**  
  The chained method call (`LBGAnalytics.events.genericEvent`) must be available and properly initialised within the global scope for the extension’s event reporting to function correctly.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Scenario
- **Single Password Field:**  
  Suppose a webpage contains a single password input with the value "Passw0rd!".
  - The extension selects the password field (since there is only one).
  - The complexity score is calculated:
    - Length (9 characters): +1 (meets the 8-character minimum)
    - Lowercase letters: +1
    - Uppercase letters: +1
    - Numeric digits: +1
    - Special characters: +1  
  - **Total Score:** 5  
  - The extension then calls:  
    LBGAnalytics.events.genericEvent(61, 5).genericEvent(62)

### Edge Conditions

- **Multiple Password Fields:**  
  If the page contains more than one password field:
  - The mapping function returns `undefined` for all entries since the condition (`a.length === 1`) fails.
  - As a result, no password is processed or scored.
  
- **Empty Password Field:**  
  If the password field is present but has no value:
  - It is filtered out by the `.filter(function (a) { return !!a.value; })` check.
  - No events are fired since no score is computed.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Single Field Processing Only:**  
  The extension only processes the password field if there is exactly one present. Pages with multiple password inputs (for example, for confirmation) will result in the field(s) being ignored.
  
- **ES6 Method Usage:**  
  The use of `Array.from` is an ES6 feature. Although polyfills may be present, environments that strictly enforce ES5 may require an alternative solution.
  
- **Dependency on LBGAnalytics:**  
  The extension assumes that the `LBGAnalytics` global object and its `genericEvent` method exist. If this object is not available or is modified by other scripts, the extension may fail to report events correctly.
  
- **Chained Event Calls:**  
  The chaining of `genericEvent` calls (i.e. calling `.genericEvent(62)` immediately after `.genericEvent(61, score)`) could lead to unexpected behaviour if the API does not truly support chaining in the way expected.

- **Unused Parameters:**  
  The parameters `eventType` and `eventPayload` are not utilised in the logic and could potentially be misleading for future maintainers.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Clarify the Intended Behaviour:**  
  - Revisit the condition that only allows processing when exactly one password field exists. If multiple password fields should be supported or the first should be selected, update the logic accordingly.
  
- **Improve Code Readability:**  
  - Replace chained array method calls with intermediate variables. This enhances clarity and makes debugging easier.
  - Consider adding comments within the code detailing each step of the process.

- **Defensive Checks:**  
  - While the availability of `eventType` and `eventPayload` is guaranteed, also verify that `LBGAnalytics` and the required methods on it exist before calling them. This would prevent runtime errors in situations where dependant scripts are delayed or fail.
  - Although using ES5 syntax is a requirement, ensure polyfills for ES6 methods like `Array.from` are loaded if compatibility with older browsers is necessary.
  
- **Modularisation:**  
  - Encapsulate the password scoring logic in a separate, well-named function. This makes unit testing easier and isolates the complexity of the score calculation.
  - Separate the DOM selection logic from the event reporting logic to adhere to single-responsibility principles.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**
  - Ensure that any changes to the password complexity requirements or event reporting format are reflected both in the code and in this documentation.
  - Maintain thorough inline documentation and code comments to aid future developers in understanding the purpose and design of the extension.
  
- **Ownership & Code Reviews:**
  - The analytics or web security team should take ownership of this extension.
  - Subject the extension to regular code reviews and include unit tests that cover typical and edge-case password inputs.

- **Testing Guidelines:**
  - Implement tests that cover scenarios with exactly one password field, multiple fields, and fields with empty values.
  - Simulate various password strengths to ensure that the scoring algorithm is accurate.
  - Verify that the chained event reporting works as expected in the production environment.

- **Documentation Updates:**
  - Document any changes to the logic, especially decisions that affect how many password fields are processed.
  - Keep a change log of updates to both the code and this documentation for future reference.
