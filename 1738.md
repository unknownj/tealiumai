# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name**: Scrape of Meta Robots tag
- **ID**: 1738
- **Type**: Javascript Code
- **Scope**: 928
- **Execution Frequency**: Active

### Summary
This Tealium iQ extension scrapes the content of the `<meta name="robots">` tag from the HTML document of the webpage. The extracted content is formatted and assigned to `s.prop52`, which enables the collection and use of metadata that directs search engine indexing behaviour. This extension is beneficial for optimising SEO strategies and understanding how the site needs to be crawled by search engines.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- `s.prop52`: A property of the tracking object used to store the formatted output derived from the meta tag.

### Logic Flow
1. The extension attempts to access the `<meta name="robots">` element in the DOM using `document.querySelector("meta[name=robots]")`.
2. If the element exists, it retrieves the `content` attribute, which may contain multiple values separated by commas (e.g., "index, follow").
3. The content is then processed as follows:
   - All commas are replaced with spaces.
   - The string is split into an array of individual directives.
   - Empty entries are filtered out from the array.
   - A new formatted string is generated from the filtered contents:
     - The first entry prefixed with "Full: ".
     - Each entry prefixed with "Item: ".
4. This resulting string is joined with semicolons and assigned to `s.prop52`.

### Dependencies
The extension relies on standard DOM methods (`document.querySelector`) and JavaScript array manipulation methods (`split`, `join`, `filter`, `map`). No external libraries are required.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Condition Scenario
- **Scenario**: Assume the webpage contains the meta tag:
  ```html
  <meta name="robots" content="index, follow">
  ```
  - **Data Flow**: 
    - The extension scrapes the meta content, processes it, and formats it as:
      ```
      Full: index follow; Item: index; Item: follow
      ```
    - This formatted string is stored in `s.prop52` for usage in analytics.

### Edge Condition Scenario
- **Scenario**: The meta tag is missing:
  ```html
  <!-- No <meta name="robots"> Tag -->
  ```
  - **Behaviour**:
    - The code gracefully handles the absence of the tag with a try-catch statement, resulting in no action taken, and `s.prop52` remains undefined or unchanged.

### Another Edge Condition Scenario
- **Scenario**: The meta tag has unusual spacing:
  ```html
  <meta name="robots" content=" ,index,,, follow,    ">
  ```
  - **Data Flow**:
    - The processing logic removes excess spaces and empty entries:
      ```
      Full: index follow; Item: index; Item: follow
      ```

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Missing Tag**: If the `<meta name="robots">` tag is absent, `s.prop52` will not be set, which may lead to incomplete data in your analytics.
- **Extra Spaces & Commas**: The extension does handle extra spaces and commas; however, variations in the meta tag formatting may lead to unexpected results.
- **Conflicts**: Ensure there are no other extensions or scripts that manipulate `s.prop52` simultaneously, which may cause data integrity issues.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks**: Although `eventType` and `eventPayload` are guaranteed, additional checks can be introduced to verify if the `meta` tag is present before attempting to access its attributes. This can prevent runtime errors. 
- **Code Style**: Consider consistently formatting the code for enhanced readability, including using consistent indentation and spacing patterns.
- **Modularization**: Splitting the processing logic into a separate function could improve readability and maintainability, even though weâ€™re maintaining ES5 standards.
- **Error Logging**: While not strictly necessary, logging errors that occur inside the catch block can assist in debugging future issues.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ownership**: Designate a developer or team responsible for maintaining this extension. They should document any changes made to the logic or usage over time.
- **Testing Guidelines**: Establish a testing protocol to validate the functionality across multiple environments (staging, production) and ensure the extension behaves as expected with diverse web pages.
- **Review Cycle**: Schedule regular reviews of the extension to validate its performance and usability, especially after major updates to the Tealium iQ platform or related scripts.

This documentation should serve as a comprehensive reference for developers and stakeholders interfacing with the "Scrape of Meta Robots tag" extension in Tealium iQ.
