# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation

## 1. Extension Overview
- **Name**: Scrape of Meta Robots tag
- **ID**: 1738
- **Type**: Javascript Code
- **Scope**: 928
- **Execution Frequency**: On every event

### Summary
This extension is designed to scrape the content of the `meta` tag with the name attribute set to `robots`. It processes and formats the scraped data into a string that can be sent to an analytics platform. By extracting these meta tags, the extension provides insights on page-level SEO configurations, enabling better tracking and reporting of page accessibility and indexing settings.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- **`s.prop52`**: This variable is where the processed string result will be stored. It is assumed to be a property defined in the tracking library (likely Adobe Analytics).
- **`eventType`, `eventPayload`, `tagObject`**: These are parameter placeholders for the extension function. They are guaranteed to be present and contain relevant event data.

### Logic Flow
1. The function attempts to access the `meta` tag with `name="robots"`.
2. It retrieves the `content` attribute of this tag.
3. The content is then processed through a series of transformations:
   - **Splitting**: The content is split into an array by commas.
   - **Joining**: The commas are replaced with spaces.
   - **Filtering**: It filters out any empty strings to ensure only meaningful entries remain.
   - **Mapping**: It formats the output into a string, where the first entry indicates "Full" access settings
     and subsequent entries are prefixed with "Item".
4. The final output is assigned to `s.prop52`.
5. If any error occurs at any step (e.g., the `meta` tag is not present), it catches the error without any specific action, allowing the function to fail silently without affecting other processes.

### Dependencies
- This extension relies on global `document` object to access the DOM. It assumes the page has been fully loaded and the relevant `meta` tags are present.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Condition
Assuming the HTML is as follows:
```html
<meta name="robots" content="index, follow">
```
The output stored in `s.prop52` would be:
```
Full: index, follow; Item: index; Item: follow
```

### Edge Conditions
1. **Meta Tag Absent**:
   If there is no `meta` tag with `name="robots"`, no error will be thrown, and `s.prop52` will remain undefined or unchanged.
   
   Example:
   ```html
   <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
   ```
   Result: `s.prop52` will not be set and will remain unchanged.

2. **Empty Content**:
   If the `meta` tag exists but has an empty content:
   ```html
   <meta name="robots" content="">
   ```
   Result: 
   ```
   Full: ; Item: 
   ```
   In this case, the output will hold empty entries which may not be useful.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas
- The extension only processes the first `meta` tag with the name `robots`. If multiple tags exist, only the first one will be taken into account.
- If the `content` attribute contains invalid or unexpected formats, the results may not be meaningful.
- Silent failure could lead to the unawareness of issues (e.g., missing `meta` tags), so monitoring results in `s.prop52` is encouraged.
- Conflicts may occur if other scripts are manipulating the same property (`s.prop52`) at the same time, leading to race conditions.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring
- **Defensive Checks**: It could be beneficial to implement checks to confirm the existence of the element and to handle multiple formats or unexpected content, providing logs for error monitoring.
  
- **Code Style**: Maintain consistency in function declarations and variable naming conventions for clarity.
  
- **Modularization**: Extract the core scraping and formatting logic into a separate function for reusability and easier testing, maintaining ES5 support.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes
- **Ownership**: Assign a dedicated developer or team to review and maintain the extension periodically.
- **Ongoing Testing**: Regularly test the extension on various pages to ensure consistent behaviour, especially after changes to the website structure or content.
- **Documentation Updates**: Keep this documentation updated with any changes in functionality or issues encountered during maintenance and development.
