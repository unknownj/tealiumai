# Extension: Scrape of Meta Robots tag

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Scrape of Meta Robots tag  
- **ID:** 1738 (Extension ID: 100036)  
- **Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** 928  
- **Execution Frequency:** Runs on the defined load rule (typically on page load or when the load rule conditions are met)

**Summary:**  
This extension is designed to scrape the content of the HTML `<meta name="robots">` tag, process its comma-delimited directives, and then store the processed data in a variable (`s.prop52`). The content is transformed into a more readable format by splitting the directives, removing any extra whitespace, and prefixing the first element with an overall summary ('Full: ...;') followed by individual items for each value found. This enhancement enables easier consumption of the meta tag data in subsequent analytics or tag management processes.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables and Objects

- **s.prop52:**  
  The output variable where the processed content of the meta robots tag is stored. It is expected that the analytics object `s` (likely a sitecatalyst or similar object) exists in the global scope.

- **document.querySelector("meta[name=robots]"):**  
  The DOM method used to locate the `<meta>` element with the attribute name set to "robots". This is the source of the meta tag content.

### Logic Flow

1. **Encapsulation:**  
   The code is wrapped in an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) which accepts three parameters (`a`, `b`, `u`). These correspond to `eventType`, `eventPayload`, and `tagObject`, though the function only uses the global `document` object for its operations.

2. **Data Extraction:**  
   - Using `document.querySelector("meta[name=robots]")`, the code retrieves the meta robots tag.
   - It then calls `.getAttribute("content")` on this element to get the directive string.

3. **Data Processing:**  
   - The content is split on commas using `.split(",")`.
   - The resulting array is then joined into a string with a single space (`.join(" ")`), ensuring that any comma separators are replaced with spaces.
   - The string is split again on spaces (`.split(" ")`) to produce an array of individual tokens.
   - The array is filtered with `.filter(function(a){ return !!a; })` to remove any empty strings.

4. **Mapping Operation:**  
   - The `.map(function(e, i, a){ ... })` method iterates over each token.
   - For the first element (when `i === 0`), it prefixes the returned value with `"Full: " + a.join(",") + ";"` creating a summary of all comma-separated values.
   - Each element is then concatenated with `"Item: " + e`, ensuring that each token is individually labelled.
   - Finally, the mapped array elements are joined back together as a single semicolon-separated string using `.join(";")`.

5. **Error Handling:**  
   - The entire operation is wrapped in a `try-catch` block. If any error occurs (e.g., if the meta tag doesn't exist) the exception is caught and silently handled.

### Dependencies on Global Objects

- **document:** Used to query the DOM and extract the meta robots tag.
- **s:** A global object where `s.prop52` is set with the processed string. This dependency is typically part of a larger analytics framework (like Adobe SiteCatalyst).

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Scenario

**Input HTML Example:**

```html
<meta name="robots" content="index, follow, noarchive">
```

**Steps & Outcome:**

1. The query selects the above meta tag.
2. Retrieves the attribute value: `"index, follow, noarchive"`.
3. Processing:
   - Splits into an array: ["index", " follow", " noarchive"]
   - Joins with spaces: `"index  follow  noarchive"`
   - Splits into tokens: ["index", "follow", "noarchive"]
4. Mapping results in:
   - For first token ("index"): `"Full: index,follow,noarchive;Item: index"`
   - For second token ("follow"): `"Item: follow"`
   - For third token ("noarchive"): `"Item: noarchive"`
5. Final stored value in `s.prop52`:  
   `"Full: index,follow,noarchive;Item: index;Item: follow;Item: noarchive"`

### Edge Case Scenario

**No meta tag present:**

- If the `<meta name="robots">` tag is not present on the page, the code in the `try` block will throw an exception. Due to the `catch` block, the error is silently swallowed and no value is assigned to `s.prop52`.

**Meta tag with unusual spacing or empty tokens:**

- If the content attribute has irregular spacing (e.g. `"index , , follow "`), the filter function removes empty or falsey values ensuring the final array contains only valid directives.
- The mapping would then process only the cleaned-up tokens.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Absence of Meta Tag:**  
  If the `<meta name="robots">` tag does not exist on the page, the error is silently caught and the extension does nothing, potentially leaving `s.prop52` undefined.

- **Unexpected Content Format:**  
  The code assumes that the meta tag content is comma-delimited. If another delimiter is used, the output may be inaccurate.

- **Global Object Dependency:**  
  The function depends on the global `s` object. If `s` is not defined or if another extension reassigns it unexpectedly, the processed data might not be captured as intended.

- **Potential Conflict with Other Extensions:**  
  Any other Tealium extension modifying `s.prop52` may conflict with this extension. Coordination between extensions that interact with common global variables is necessary.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Error Logging:**  
  Instead of silently catching errors, consider logging a warning message (if permitted by the project guidelines) so that developers are informed about issues when the meta tag is missing.

- **Modularisation:**  
  Although ES5 is required, isolating code logic into helper functions can improve readability. For example, creating dedicated functions for tokenisation or mapping can make the code easier to maintain.

- **Defensive Checks:**  
  While it is guaranteed that `eventType` and `eventPayload` are available, consider checking for the presence of the `s` object before attempting to set `s.prop52`.

- **Code Comments:**  
  Increase inline documentation explaining each transformation step for easier familiarity by future maintainers.

- **Consistent Variable Naming:**  
  Consider using more descriptive variable names where possible (within the ES5 constraints) to improve clarity.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  - Regularly review the extension when updates to the site’s HTML structure or analytics requirements occur.
  - Verify that the meta tag content format remains consistent with the parser logic.

- **Ownership:**  
  - Assign a team or individual to monitor changes related to global variables (`s`).
  - Document any dependencies on third-party frameworks clearly.

- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Create test cases for pages with and without the meta tag to ensure that the error handling works as expected.
  - Use browser developer tools to inspect `s.prop52` after page load.
  - Consider regression tests following updates to the site's HTML or Tealium configurations.

- **Further Enhancements:**  
  - Evaluate implementing more robust logging or error handling in development builds.
  - Ensure that any changes maintain ES5 compatibility as per the project requirements.

This documentation should provide a thorough understanding of the extension’s purpose, internal logic, usage scenarios, limitations, and areas for improvement. It can be shared with both developers and stakeholders to ensure clarity and facilitate future maintenance.
