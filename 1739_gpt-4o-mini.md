# Additional Link Decoration Extension Documentation

## Extension Overview

- **Name**: Additional Link Decoration
- **ID**: 100036
- **Type**: Javascript Code
- **Scope**: DOM Ready
- **Execution Frequency**: Run Once

### Summary
The Additional Link Decoration extension enhances link tracking capabilities on web pages by decorating links that lead to eligible domains and meet certain criteria. This is done to facilitate tracking user interactions with links, specifically for URLs that begin with `https://`. The purpose of this extension is to improve analytic insights by tracking user behaviour regarding links that may lead to various financial services and products.

## Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- `eligibleDomains`: An array of domain names that are considered eligible for decoration. These domains include links associated with Halifax, Lloyds Bank, Bank of Scotland, and Lloyds Link.

### Logic Flow
1. **Initialization Check**: The extension checks if `LBGAnalytics.$.fn.decorate` exists, confirming that the decoration function is available.
2. **Event Listener**: An event listener for `mousedown` is attached to all anchor (`<a>`) elements:
   - The event listener retrieves the `href` attribute of the link clicked.
   - Several checks are performed:
     - The `href` must be a string and start with `https://`.
     - It must not contain the default domain cookie of `LBGAnalytics`.
     - It avoids specific login URLs and paths.
     - Finally, it checks if the link's host matches any eligible domains.
3. **Decoration**: If all checks are passed, the selected link is decorated with a cookie hash (using `LBGAnalytics.cookies.getCookieHash(60)`).
4. **Additional Decoration**: A second attempt to decorate certain links containing 'mortgages.secure.' and '/homes/' is made, using a try-catch block to handle potential errors quietly.

### Dependencies
- **Global Objects**: The code relies on the `LBGAnalytics` object, specifically its jQuery-like `$` function and cookie handling methods. 
- **jQuery**: Itâ€™s assumed that jQuery is available in the global scope as this extension manipulates DOM elements based on jQuery selectors.

## Usage Examples

### Normal Conditions
- When a user clicks on a valid link to `https://www.halifax-online.co.uk/mortgages`, the extension executes without interruption, attaching the necessary tracking data.

### Edge Conditions
- If a user clicks on a link to a non-secure site (e.g. `http://www.example.com`), the link is ignored, and no decoration occurs.
- If a user clicks on a link that leads to one of the excluded paths (like `/personal/logon/login.jsp`), decoration will not occur, maintaining integrity in analytics.

## Known Limitations & Gotchas
- If the jQuery-like framework (`LBGAnalytics.$`) is not properly loaded before this extension is executed, the entire functionality will break.
- The extension may not trigger on dynamically loaded links added to the DOM after the page has initially loaded. Be cautious when using single-page applications (SPAs) or frameworks that manipulate the DOM extensively.
- Any other extension manipulating link behaviour may interfere with how this extension operates.

## Recommendations for Refactoring
- **Error Logging**: Instead of just console logging, consider implementing a structured error logging framework to capture and track exceptions for troubleshooting.
- **Code Style**: Adhere to a more consistent coding style by using meaningful whitespace and comments for clarity.
- **Modularization**: The event handler should be modularized into a separate function to improve readability and maintainability. This helps in isolating logic and enhances testability:
  
  ```javascript
  function handleLinkDecoration() {
    try {
      // core logic for decoration
    } catch (e) { console.log(e); }
  }
  ```

## Maintenance & Further Notes
- **Ongoing Maintenance**: Regularly review the eligible domains list to ensure it remains current as business needs change or domains get updated.
- **Ownership**: Assign a dedicated owner for this extension to ensure all maintenance and updates are documented.
- **Testing Guidelines**: Implement a testing protocol for future changes, ensuring that critical functionality, such as the URL checks and decoration process, remains intact during updates.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Set up a performance monitoring system to see how this extension affects page performance and user interactions over time.
