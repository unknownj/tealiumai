# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation – Additional Link Decoration

This document provides a comprehensive explanation of the "Additional Link Decoration" Tealium iQ extension including its overview, code explanation, usage examples, known limitations, recommendations for refactoring, and maintenance notes. The goal is to ensure that all developers and stakeholders understand the purpose, functionality, and future considerations for this extension.

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Additional Link Decoration  
- **ID:** 1739  
- **Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** DOM Ready  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Once  

**Summary:**  
This extension is designed to append a special decoration to qualifying anchor links based on a set of criteria. It utilises a global jQuery-like library (accessed as LBGAnalytics.$) to attach an event handler to link elements. When a user interacts with eligible links (for example, when a mousedown event occurs), the extension checks several conditions such as URL structure, domain eligibility, and specific URL fragments. If all conditions are met, a cookie-derived hash is appended to the link via a decoration method. This decoration process assists in tracking or modifying the behaviour of links, particularly for secure domains and mortgage-related content.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables & Dependencies

- **eligibleDomains:**  
  An array of strings that lists the domain names eligible for decoration. This list includes multiple subdomains for Halifax, Lloyds Bank, and Bank of Scotland.

- **LBGAnalytics.$:**  
  A global object used in place of the standard jQuery library. It is employed to select DOM elements, bind events, and invoke the decorate function on anchor elements.

- **LBGAnalytics.cookies:**  
  A global object providing cookie-related functionalities. The extension uses two members:
  - `defaultDomain`: Used to check if the href of an anchor is part of the current domain.
  - `getCookieHash(60)`: Generates a hash value based on a cookie, likely with an expiration of 60 (seconds/minutes as per the application's internal logic).

- **decorate:**  
  A function (assumed to have been added as a jQuery plugin) that is applied to anchor elements to decorate them with tracking data.

### Logic Flow

1. **Dependency Check:**  
   The code first verifies if the decorate function exists on the LBGAnalytics.$.fn object. If not, the extension does not proceed.

2. **Event Binding:**  
   - It selects all anchor elements (`<a>`) that have an href attribute.
   - Registers an event handler for the mousedown event.

3. **Event Handler Logic:**
   - **Error Handling:**  
     Wrapped within a try-catch block to ensure that any exceptions during runtime are caught and logged without breaking the page.
   - **Fetching Attributes:**  
     Retrieves the href attribute of the clicked anchor.
   - **Type and Content Checks:**  
     - Ensures that the href is a string.
     - Only processes links that begin with "https://".
     - Skips processing if the href contains the default domain from LBGAnalytics.cookies.
   - **Login & Form Checks:**  
     Skips the decoration if the href contains specific paths like `/personal/logon/login.jsp` (if not targeting a new tab),
     `/_mem_bin/formslogin.asp`, `/cwa/l/ccc/`, or `/cwa/h/ccc/`.
   - **Domain Eligibility:**  
     Checks whether the domain (extracted from the href) contains any string present in the `eligibleDomains` array.  
     If no match is found, the function returns.
   - **Decoration Application:**  
     If all checks pass, the decorate function is invoked on the element with the decoration key "LBGAc" and a cookie hash value (obtained by calling `LBGAnalytics.cookies.getCookieHash(60)`).

4. **Additional Decoration for Mortgage Links:**
   - An extra try-catch block targets anchors whose href contains both `'mortgages.secure.'` and `'/homes/'`.
   - These links receive immediate decoration regardless of the earlier event binding, ensuring that secure mortgage pages are always decorated.

### Global Dependencies:
- LBGAnalytics (with its sub-modules `$` and `cookies`)
- The decorate plugin method on LBGAnalytics.$.fn

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Operation Scenario

1. **User Interaction:**  
   A user presses the mouse button (mousedown event) over an anchor link.

2. **Eligible Domain:**  
   Suppose the link's href is “https://apply.halifax-online.co.uk/somepage”.  
   - It passes the "https://" check.
   - It is confirmed that the link’s domain is in `eligibleDomains`.
   - It does not match any skip conditions (e.g. login or specific pages).

3. **Decoration Applied:**  
   The decorate method is invoked, and the link is updated with additional tracking data (the cookie hash).

### Edge Case Scenario

- **Non-eligible Domain:**  
  If a link's href is “https://www.someotherbank.co.uk/page”, the function returns without executing decoration.
  
- **Protected Paths:**  
  If the link contains “/personal/logon/login.jsp” without a "target" parameter (or matches any other skip conditions), decoration is bypassed.
  
- **Mortgage-specific Case:**  
  Any anchor with an href containing “mortgages.secure.” and “/homes/” will be decorated immediately by the second try-catch block, regardless of the mousedown event.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Global Dependency Reliance:**  
  The extension depends on the availability and proper functioning of `LBGAnalytics`, including its `$` and `cookies` properties. If these are unavailable or modified by other scripts, the extension may fail.

- **Assumption of a jQuery-like Library:**  
  The code is based on a jQuery interface (using selectors, event binding, and plugins), which may conflict with other libraries or extensions if not managed carefully.

- **Specific URL Conditions:**  
  The URL-based conditions are hard-coded. Any changes in the URL structure of the target domains or the way login and secure pages are served could break the decoration logic.

- **Error Logging:**  
  Errors caught in try-catch blocks are only logged to the console. This may not be sufficient for robust error handling or monitoring in production environments.

- **Event Handling on mousedown:**  
  Binding to mousedown might trigger multiple times if a user clicks rapidly. Although the extension is marked to run once, ensure this behaviour is consistent with requirements.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Modularise the Code:**  
  Create separate functions for:
  - Validating the href (e.g. isHttpsLink, isEligibleDomain, isProtectedPath).
  - Decorating the element.
  This improves readability and reusability.

- **Enhanced Error Management:**  
  Consider implementing a more robust logging mechanism or error reporting system rather than solely relying on console.log.

- **Domain Matching Improvements:**  
  The eligibility check using `indexOf` on the domain extracted from the href can be refined. Consider extracting the hostname and using exact matches or regular expressions for improved accuracy.

- **Defensive Programming:**  
  Although the availability of eventType and eventPayload is guaranteed, similar defensive checks for other global objects (if ever circumstances change) could improve stability in future revisions.

- **Code Comments & Documentation:**  
  Adding inline comments explaining the rationale behind each check aids future developers in understanding and potentially modifying the extension.

- **Maintain ES5 Syntax:**  
  As the requirements specify ES5 support, the code should continue using function declarations, var for variable definitions, and string concatenation instead of modern ES6 features.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Compatibility Testing:**  
  Ensure that any updates to the LBGAnalytics global object or changes in the URL structures of the target domains are communicated and tested with this extension.

- **Ownership & Code Reviews:**  
  Assign a dedicated owner or team to review changes to the extension periodically. Code reviews should especially focus on any modifications affecting the event handling and global dependency checks.

- **Automated Testing:**  
  Develop unit tests or integration tests that simulate mousedown events and verify that eligible links receive the appropriate decoration. This will help catch regressions when other parts of the system are updated.

- **Documentation Updates:**  
  Keep this documentation in sync with any future code changes. Consider establishing a versioning system for the extension to track changes over time.

- **Performance Considerations:**  
  As the extension attaches events to all anchor elements on the page, monitor client-side performance, especially on pages with a large number of links.
