# FPHD Tealium iQ Extension Documentation

This document provides a thorough overview and explanation of the FPHD extension, an in-page script used to capture, process, and store first party hashed data such as email addresses and phone numbers. It outlines how the extension works, provides usage examples, highlights potential limitations, and recommends improvements for future maintenance.

---

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** FPHD  
- **Extension ID:** 1740 (with an overall extensionId of 100036)  
- **Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** 1459  
- **Execution Frequency:**  
  - The extension attaches event listeners on page load and on DOM change events. It is generally executed once per page load in eligible pages and whenever the specified form fields have a change event.

**Summary:**  
The FPHD extension is designed to capture user input (specifically email addresses and phone numbers) from various form fields on the page. It validates and then hashes these values using a SHA256 hash function from the Tealium library (utag.ut.sha256). Hashed values are stored in an internal data object, then propagated to the global event payload (b) and even saved in session storage to preserve state during a user journey. The extension also contains logic for checking page eligibility (using an array of eligibility expressions) and for extracting pre-hashed values from the data layer if available.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables & Global Objects

- **Function parameters:**  
  - `a` represents the eventType (a string).  
  - `b` is the eventPayload (an object).  
  - `u` represents the tagObject.

- **Global objects/dependencies:**  
  - `LBGAnalytics` is used for logging and selecting DOM elements (via `LBGAnalytics.$`).  
  - `utag.ut.sha256` is used for performing SHA256 hashing.  
  - `sessionStorage` is utilised to persist data across page navigation.  
  - The extension also makes use of `document.addEventListener` for binding to the `change` and `onload` events, and it expects a global `CookiesTargeting` flag (in object `b`) to determine if analytics cookie targeting is active.

### Logic Flow & Data Processing

1. **Initialisation and Setup:**  
   - The extension first checks if the `FPHD` object already exists on `u`. If not, it sets up a global logging object (`window.fphdLog`) and initialises `u.FPHD` with key properties:
     - `data` – an object to store hashed field values.
     - `set` – a method to hash the given value and save it into the `data` object.
     - `eligibilityExpressions` – an array of conditions (e.g. page roles, URL patterns) that must be satisfied for the extension to proceed with its custom logic.
     - `dataItems` – an array that defines configuration objects for each data field (e.g. email and phone). Each data item includes:
       - `fieldName` – the logical name (e.g. "email" or "phone").
       - `fieldCode` – a short code (e.g. "E" for email, "P" for phone).
       - `fieldSelectors` – an array of CSS selectors used to target input fields on the page.
       - `fieldSelectorsS` – an alternate set of CSS selectors used in a fallback approach (e.g. on load for secure pages).
       - `validation` – a function to validate (and normalise) the field input; for email, a regex match is used; for phone numbers, it performs various checks and normalisations (e.g. appends country codes).

2. **Event Listeners & Data Capture:**
   - **Change Event:**  
     - A `change` event listener is attached to the document. When any input changes:
       - The listener checks for the `CookiesTargeting` flag.
       - For each data item, it verifies if the event target matches any of its defined `fieldSelectors`.
       - If a match is found, the corresponding `validation` function is executed.
       - Valid data is then hashed using the `set` method. A logging flag is raised in `window.fphdLog` for the corresponding field code.
       - For an email field, an alternately formatted "gMail" version is generated (removing periods for Gmail addresses) and stored.
   - **Onload Event:**  
     - A separate `onload` event listener is added to cater for secure pages.
       - The listener focuses on email extraction using the `fieldSelectorsS` set.
       - It retrieves data via a jQuery-like syntax (using `LBGAnalytics.$`) and applies the email validation and "gMail" normalisation steps similar to the change event.
 
3. **Data Layer Fallbacks:**  
   - The extension checks if pre-hashed values exist in `b` under `FirstPartyEmail` or `FirstPartyPhone`. If available, these are directly copied into `b` (under the keys `FPHDemail` and `FPHDphone` respectively), with log messages to indicate data capture from the data layer.

4. **Session Storage & Final Data Propagation:**  
   - After the internal data object (`u.FPHD.data`) is populated, its values are then transferred into the event payload (`b`) using keys prefixed with “FPHD”.
   - The corresponding values are also saved in session storage to mitigate loss of data between page navigations.
   - A final check is performed: if `FPHDemail`, `FPHDgMail`, or `FPHDphone` are missing from `b`, the extension attempts to retrieve them from session storage.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Scenario 1 – Normal Data Entry:
- **Scenario:**  
  A user visits a page that meets one of the eligibility expressions (e.g. PageRole contains "sales").  
- **Data Flow:**  
  - The allocation of event listeners ensures that if the user enters their email address in a recognised field (one matching a selector such as `[name='email-address']`), the change event triggers.
  - The email is validated using the regex check.  
  - The validated email is hashed (using SHA256) and stored in the `u.FPHD.data` object.
  - A normalised "gMail" version is generated if the email comes from Gmail.
  - The hashed values are copied to the event payload object (`b`) and saved into session storage.
- **Outcome:**  
  The analytics system (or other relying systems) receives the hashed email and phone data with keys such as `FPHDemail`, `FPHDgMail`, and `FPHDphone`.

### Scenario 2 – Fallback on Pre-Hashed Data:
- **Scenario:**  
  The data layer already contains pre-hashed values (e.g. `FirstPartyEmail` and `FirstPartyPhone` are available).  
- **Data Flow:**  
  - The extension checks for these values within the global event payload `b`.
  - If they exist, the extension sets `b.FPHDemail` and `b.FPHDphone` without having to process the page DOM.
  - A log entry is made via `LBGAnalytics.analyticsLog` to indicate that the data was sourced from the data layer.
- **Outcome:**  
  The extension bypasses the input field extraction process, reducing processing time.

### Scenario 3 – Non-Eligibility or CookiesTargeting Disabled:
- **Scenario:**  
  A user is on a page that does not match any of the eligibility expressions or the `CookiesTargeting` flag is not set to true.
- **Data Flow:**  
  - Early in the event listener functions, the script checks `b["CookiesTargeting"] !== true` and then sets a logging flag (`window.fphdLog.X`) before returning from the function.
- **Outcome:**  
  The extension stops processing further, meaning no data is captured or hashed. This prevents unnecessary overhead on pages that should not trigger FPHD behaviour.

---

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **CookiesTargeting Check:**  
  - The extension contains multiple return points based on the `CookiesTargeting` flag. If this flag is false, the extension does not process data further, which might be confusing if the integration expects some data capture.

- **Duplicate Code Blocks:**  
  - There is a duplicate block for handling `FirstPartyPhone` data. This redundancy can lead to maintenance challenges.

- **Event Listener for Onload:**  
  - The "onload" event listener is attached using `document.addEventListener("onload", ...)`, which may not fire reliably across all browsers or in cases where the document is already loaded. Typically, a window load event is preferred.

- **Selector Duplication & Specificity:**  
  - The extension uses multiple selectors for the same field. While this increases the chances of capturing data, it could also introduce conflicts when more than one element matches a selector.

- **Dependencies:**  
  - The extension depends on external objects and libraries like `LBGAnalytics`, `utag.ut.sha256`, and the availability of sessionStorage. If any of these are unavailable or behave unexpectedly, the extension might fail silently due to the broad error catching.

---

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Eliminate Duplicate Code:**  
  - Remove the duplicate block of code for handling `FirstPartyPhone` to reduce redundancy.

- **Improve Event Handling:**  
  - Consider refactoring the onload listener to use a more standard approach (e.g. `window.onload`) or use a DOMContentLoaded event to ensure reliability across browsers.

- **Enhance Defensive Coding:**  
  - While defensive checks for `eventType` and `eventPayload` are not required, additional checks for the existence of global objects (such as `LBGAnalytics`, `utag.ut.sha256`, and sessionStorage) may prevent unexpected failures in environments where these are not available.

- **Modularisation:**  
  - Break out functionality into discrete functions (e.g. separate normalisation logic for email, common validation routines) to improve readability and ease future updates.
  
- **Code Comments & Style:**  
  - Increase inline commenting to explain non-obvious logic, particularly around the normalisation of Gmail addresses.
  - Adhere to consistent code formatting practices. Although ES5 must be supported, clearer function definitions (using named functions rather than inline anonymous functions) could facilitate debugging.

- **Error Logging:**  
  - Consider logging errors to a central location or using a custom error handler instead of silently swallowing exceptions in every catch block. This would improve troubleshooting when issues occur.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  - Ensure that updates to dependent libraries (like Tealium’s hashing library or LBGAnalytics) are tracked and tested with the FPHD extension.
  - Regularly review the eligibility expressions and field selectors. As pages evolve over time, selectors may need updates to continue capturing data correctly.

- **Ownership & Versioning:**  
  - Assign a code owner or team responsible for this extension. Use version control practices (e.g. Git branching, commit messages) to track changes.
  - Document any changes to business rules (such as modifications in eligibility expressions) separately, as these may have wider implications.

- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Implement thorough testing on various pages to ensure all selectors correctly capture and process user inputs.
  - Test in environments where cookies and other targeting conditions may be disabled to ensure expected early returns.
  - Validate that session storage correctly preserves data through page navigations and that fallbacks reliably restore missing data.

- **Future Enhancements:**  
  - If requirements allow, consider enhancing logging to better trace user interactions.
  - Monitor performance effects, as attaching global event listeners may have implications on page load speeds on complex pages.
