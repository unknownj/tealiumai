# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: AOU and BOU Config for custom template 992

This document provides a comprehensive overview, explanation, usage examples, known limitations, and recommendations for the Tealium iQ extension configuration contained in the provided code snippet.

---

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** AOU and BOU Config for custom template 992  
- **ID:** 1743  
- **Extension Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** Pre Loader  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Once

**Summary:**  
This extension initialises a configuration object (LBGAnalytics.tagConfig) that stores lists of tag IDs and page paths relevant to specific runtime conditions. It essentially categorises tags into different groups based on their consent requirements or situational contexts (e.g. logon pages versus webviews). By organising these tags into separate arrays, the extension helps manage which tags should always run, which should be blocked on specific pages (like logon pages), and which are allowed in app webviews. This configuration is used to integrate various tracking and analytics services under different conditions.

---

## 2. Code Explanation

The extension sets up a global configuration object on `LBGAnalytics` with several key properties:

- **Global Object Dependency:**  
  - Assumes the `LBGAnalytics` object exists in the global namespace.
  
- **Key Variables & Properties:**
  
  - **requiresCSP:**  
    An array of tags (in this example, a single tag "1550") that require a Content Security Policy (CSP) check. These tags may have additional security requirements before they can be executed.
  
  - **omitTags:**  
    An array of tag numeric IDs that are omitted from the Privacy Manager. These tags run irrespective of the consent status because they relate to technologies not requiring consent. Note that some tag IDs appear more than once (e.g. 912) – an observation that may require attention.
  
  - **essentialTags:**  
    A list (array) of tag IDs (provided as strings) permitted to run on the logon page. The extension confines tag execution on logon pages to these essential tags.
  
  - **criticalPages:**  
    An array of strings listing the URLs or URL substrings that define the logon pages. On these pages, non-essential tags will be blocked.
  
  - **ngaAllowable:**  
    An array of tag IDs (as strings) that are permitted to run within webviews of the application. This is particularly targeted for integrations such as Adobe, Demdex, and webchat functionalities.

- **Logic Flow:**
  - The code is not executing any dynamic functions; it is purely a configuration setup.
  - Once loaded, the extension assigns the configuration to the global object, making it available for other Tealium modules or scripts that query these arrays to determine tag execution behaviour.
  
- **Comments:**  
  - Inline comments provide context such as approvals from development operations (e.g. for DC tag on business logon page) and reference to specific tickets (e.g. MI pages, Webchat integration).

## 3. Usage Examples

### Example 1: Tag Execution on a Logon Page

Scenario:  
A user visits the logon page with a URL matching one of the entries in `criticalPages` (e.g. "/logon/login.jsp").

- **Normal Behavior:**  
  - The system will inspect the page URL and compare it against the `criticalPages` array.
  - Only tags listed in `essentialTags` will be permitted to execute.
  - All other tags (even if they are present in other arrays like `omitTags`) will be blocked on this page.

### Example 2: Behaviour in an App Webview

Scenario:  
A user opens the application in a webview environment.

- **Normal Flow:**  
  - The configuration may be checked to determine if the tag is within the `ngaAllowable` list.
  - If the tag ID is present in the `ngaAllowable` array, it is allowed to run.
  
### Example 3: Tag with CSP Requirements

Scenario:  
A new tag with ID "1550" (as listed in `requiresCSP`) is encountered.

- **Expected Behaviour:**  
  - This tag may trigger additional checks before executing, such as a CSP (Content Security Policy) requirement validation.
  - The tag will not run unless the CSP conditions are met, providing an extra layer of security.

### Example 4: Handling Duplicated Tag IDs

Scenario:  
A tag ID (e.g., 912) appears more than once in `omitTags`.

- **Edge Condition:**  
  - The duplication does not inherently break the configuration but can lead to confusion during maintenance.
  - The system is expected to treat the ID as omitted; however, duplication might need to be cleaned to avoid redundant processing.

---

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Duplication of Tag IDs:**  
  - Some tag IDs are repeated in the `omitTags` array (e.g. 912), which can lead to ambiguity. It does not affect the behaviour but could cause confusion during debugging and maintenance.

- **Dependency on Global Objects:**  
  - The configuration relies on the existence of the global `LBGAnalytics` object. If this object is not properly initialised or if another script overwrites it later, it could lead to errors.

- **Static Configuration:**  
  - This extension only sets static values. There are no dynamic validations or runtime checks. Any changes to tag IDs or page paths require a manual update to the config arrays.

- **Script Execution Order Conflicts:**  
  - Since this extension runs in the Pre Loader phase, other scripts that rely on its configuration must ensure they execute after it. Failure to maintain the correct order might lead to tags not being recognised.

- **Interdependency with Privacy Manager:**  
  - As the extension directly annotates tags for omission from the Privacy Manager, any changes in Privacy Manager requirements or tag handling logic could necessitate updates to these arrays.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Array Uniqueness:**  
  - Consider adding logic or a build-time check to ensure that arrays like `omitTags` do not contain duplicate tag IDs. This can prevent potential confusion.

- **Modularisation:**  
  - Although the current structure is straightforward, consider separating configuration concerns into distinct modules or files if the configuration grows.
  
- **Documentation in Code:**  
  - Enhance inline comments to detail why specific tags were added or omitted—this can help future developers understand the historical context (e.g. references to tickets or business rules).

- **Validation Checks:**  
  - Although defensive coding for `eventType` and `eventPayload` is not required, a small utility could be implemented to validate the presence and format of the `LBGAnalytics` object before assigning the configuration.
  
- **Consistent Data Types:**  
  - Ensure consistency in data types for tag identifiers. Currently, some arrays use numbers and some use strings. Standardising the format (e.g. all strings or all numbers) could simplify comparison logic in downstream code.

- **ES5 Compliance:**  
  - As required, maintain the use of ES5 syntax (using var declarations and function expressions) to ensure compatibility across legacy browsers.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  - Assign one or more team members from the analytics or digital marketing team as the point-of-contact for updates to this configuration.
  - Regularly review the configured tag IDs and page paths to ensure they correctly reflect current website and application structures.

- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Develop automated tests to verify that the tagged configuration arrays trigger the correct behaviour under different scenarios (e.g. logon versus webview).
  - Use staging or testing environments to validate changes before deploying to production.
  
- **Change Control:**  
  - Document all changes in the internal change log or version control system, especially when adding or removing tags from any configuration array.
  - Clearly communicate any breaking changes to stakeholders through appropriate release notes.

- **Further Documentation:**  
  - Consider creating additional technical documentation or run-books that explain how each configuration element integrates with the Tealium Privacy Manager and other related systems.

- **Code Reviews:**  
  - Implement routine code reviews for any modifications to the extension to ensure consistency with best practices and project standards.
