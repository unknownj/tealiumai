# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: Late Load Target

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name**: Late Load Target
- **ID**: 100036
- **Type**: JavaScript Code
- **Scope**: After Tag Extensions
- **Execution Frequency**: Run Always

### Summary
The "Late Load Target" extension is designed to execute a specific function, `lateLoadTarget`, if it is defined on the `window` object. This functionality allows for additional scripts or functionalities to be loaded later in the page lifecycle, providing flexibility in managing script execution times. This is especially useful for ensuring that certain actions or code only run after the necessary assets or conditions have been met.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- `window.lateLoadTarget`: A function expected to be defined globally which will be called if it exists.

### Logic Flow
1. The extension checks whether `window.lateLoadTarget` is a function.
2. If it is, `lateLoadTarget()` is invoked.

### Dependency on Global Objects
- **Global Object**: The extension relies on the `window` object to access `lateLoadTarget`. If `lateLoadTarget` is not defined, the extension silently does nothing, avoiding errors.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Condition
- **Scenario**: A scenario where `lateLoadTarget` has been defined by other scripts on the page.
    - When this extension runs, it will invoke `lateLoadTarget()`, executing any additional logic defined within that function.

### Edge Condition
- **Scenario**: The `lateLoadTarget` function is not defined.
    - In such a case, the extension checks for the function but ultimately does nothing, which is a safe handling for this absence. It ensures there are no errors thrown in the console.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Function Absence**: If `lateLoadTarget` is not defined, the extension will not execute any actions, which may lead to missed functionality if developers expect certain behaviours to occur.
- **Conflicts with Other Extensions**: If multiple extensions try to define the same `lateLoadTarget` function on the `window` object, conflicts may arise, leading to unpredictable behaviours.
- **Global Pollution**: Polluting the global scope with multiple definitions of `lateLoadTarget` can also lead to harder debugging and maintenance.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks**: While this extension checks for the availability of `lateLoadTarget`, consider logging a warning when the function is not found. This could help developers identify non-executed functionality.
- **Consistent Naming**: Ensure that the naming of the `lateLoadTarget` function is unique enough to prevent conflicts with other functions.
- **Modularisation**: Instead of using a global function, consider using a module pattern where the function is encapsulated and only exposed when necessary. This can help reduce global namespace pollution.
- **Documentation**: Include more detailed comments within the code itself for clarity, especially explaining what the `lateLoadTarget` should be performing.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance**: Regularly review the definition and functionality of `lateLoadTarget` to ensure it aligns with current business requirements and practices.
- **Ownership**: Designate a team or individual responsible for maintaining this extension and its dependent functions.
- **Testing Guidelines**: 
    - Implement unit tests to verify the existence and functionality of `lateLoadTarget`.
    - Test under various conditions (presence, absence, and conflicts) to ensure robustness.

By adhering to these guidelines and recommendations, the "Late Load Target" extension can be effectively managed and maintained, ensuring that it continues to deliver its intended functionality without unforeseen issues.
