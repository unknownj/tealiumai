# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: Late Load Target

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Late Load Target
- **ID:** 100036
- **Type:** Javascript Code
- **Scope:** After Tag Extensions
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Always

### Summary
The "Late Load Target" extension is designed to execute a specified function (`window.lateLoadTarget`) if it is defined in the global scope. This functionality allows for lazy loading of specific targets or functionalities after the primary tags have executed.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- `window.lateLoadTarget`: A function expected to be defined globally. This function contains the logic targeted for late execution.

### Logic Flow
1. The extension checks if `window.lateLoadTarget` is a function.
2. If the condition is met, the function is called without any arguments.

### Global Dependencies
- **`window` object**: This extension relies on the global `window` object to check for the existence of the `lateLoadTarget` function. There are no dependencies on external libraries or additional global objects.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Usage Scenario
1. **Definition**: A developer defines a function globally:
   ```javascript
   window.lateLoadTarget = function() {
       console.log('Late load target executed.');
   };
   ```
2. **Execution**: When the "Late Load Target" extension runs, it checks for the definition and executes the function, resulting in:
   ```
   Late load target executed.
   ```

### Edge Condition Scenario
1. **Undefined Function**: If the function is not defined:
   ```javascript
   // window.lateLoadTarget is not defined
   ```
2. **Execution**: The extension checks for the function but does not execute anything, as the condition is not met, causing no console output.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Missing Function**: If `window.lateLoadTarget` is not defined prior to the execution of this extension, no actions will occur, leading to potential silent failures.
- **Conflicts**: If multiple extensions define or manipulate `window.lateLoadTarget`, this can cause unexpected behaviours. Ensure that the function's logic is idempotent and does not rely on any state that may be altered by other scripts.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks**: While not required, it could be beneficial for future-proofing to add additional checks or logging for any unexpected situations or errors:
  ```javascript
  if (typeof window.lateLoadTarget === "function") {
      try {
          window.lateLoadTarget();
      } catch (error) {
          console.error('Error executing lateLoadTarget:', error);
      }
  } else {
      console.warn('lateLoadTarget function is not defined.');
  }
  ```

- **Code Style**: Maintain consistent indentation and spacing to enhance readability across the codebase.

- **Modularisation**: If possible, consider breaking out the functionality of `lateLoadTarget` into a dedicated module to improve maintainability, although this is limited when targeting ES5.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

### Ongoing Maintenance
- Regularly review the global functions defined in the system for potential conflicts.
- Ensure that team members are aware of the purpose and usage of the `lateLoadTarget` function.

### Ownership
- Assign a dedicated owner for the extension who is responsible for its maintenance and updating based on evolving requirements.

### Testing Guidelines
- Develop unit tests for the `lateLoadTarget` function to ensure it performs as expected under various scenarios, including edge cases where the function is not defined.
- Ensure that any changes made to the extension or the global `lateLoadTarget` function do not impact existing functionalities or introduce regressions.

This documentation is intended to provide a comprehensive understanding of the "Late Load Target" extension for current developers and future stakeholders involved in the Tealium iQ project.
