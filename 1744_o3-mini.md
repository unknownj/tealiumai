# Late Load Target Extension Documentation

This document outlines the details for the "Late Load Target" extension configured in Tealium iQ.

---

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Late Load Target  
- **ID:** 1744 (Extension ID: 100036)  
- **Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** After Tag Extensions  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Always  

**Summary:**  
This extension is designed to conditionally execute a global function named "lateLoadTarget". It performs a type check on the window object to verify if "lateLoadTarget" is declared as a function before executing it. This mechanism ensures that code dependent on "lateLoadTarget" will only run if the function is defined, thereby minimising runtime errors.

---

## 2. Code Explanation

The primary code snippet is as follows:

    if(typeof window.lateLoadTarget === "function"){
      // window.lateLoadTarget();
    }

**Key Points:**

- **Global Dependency:**  
  The extension depends on a globally available function named "lateLoadTarget". It checks the existence and type of this function on the `window` object.

- **Type Check:**  
  The code uses the `typeof` operator to ensure that `window.lateLoadTarget` is indeed a function. This is an essential check, preventing errors if the function is not defined at runtime.

- **Execution Flow:**  
  - If the type check passes (i.e., `window.lateLoadTarget` is a function), the code inside the `if` block is meant to be executed.  
  - Currently, the function invocation `window.lateLoadTarget();` is commented out, meaning no function call will occur even if the check passes. Developers may choose to uncomment this line based on their implementation requirements.

- **Global Object Dependency:**  
  The extension does not use any external libraries. It solely relies on the global `window` object to reference the potential function, making it a minimal and self-contained snippet.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Normal Operation
- **Setup:**  
  In an environment where a function named `lateLoadTarget` is defined on the global `window` object.
  
- **Data Flow:**
  - The extension performs the type check (`typeof window.lateLoadTarget === "function"`).
  - If the check passes, uncommenting the line will trigger the execution of `window.lateLoadTarget()`.
  
- **Outcome:**  
  The logic contained within `window.lateLoadTarget` is executed, allowing for additional processing or late initialisation routines dependent on this function.

### Scenario 2: Function Not Available
- **Setup:**  
  If `lateLoadTarget` is not defined on `window`.
  
- **Data Flow:**
  - The type check fails.
  - The extension does not execute any further code.
  
- **Outcome:**  
  The extension silently bypasses the function call, avoiding potential errors or interruptions in the page's script execution.

### Scenario 3: Edge Condition – Incorrect Type
- **Setup:**  
  A variable named `lateLoadTarget` exists on `window` but is not of type function (e.g. a string or an object).
  
- **Data Flow:**
  - The type check `typeof window.lateLoadTarget` returns a data type other than "function".
  - The code inside the if-block is not executed.
  
- **Outcome:**  
  No operations occur, which prevents any inadvertent attempts to execute non-function code.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Inactive Invocation:**  
  The actual function call `window.lateLoadTarget();` is commented out. If this is accidental, the desired logic will not execute. Ensure this line is correctly uncommented when the function execution is required.

- **Dependency on Global State:**  
  The extension is inherently dependent on the global state (i.e., the existence and type of `window.lateLoadTarget`). If another script overwrites or modifies `lateLoadTarget`, unexpected behaviours might occur.

- **Conflict Potential:**  
  There might be conflicts with other Tealium iQ extensions or external scripts that manipulate or expect changes to `window.lateLoadTarget`. Coordination between multiple extensions is advisable.

- **Limited Functionality:**  
  As it stands, the extension only performs a simple check without logging or error-handling. In case of a failure, no fallback action or notification is provided.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Uncommenting the Function Call:**  
  If the design requires executing `lateLoadTarget`, update the code by uncommenting the function call:
  
      if(typeof window.lateLoadTarget === "function"){
        window.lateLoadTarget();
      }
  
- **Additional Logging:**  
  For improved debugging, consider adding logging statements (using `console.log` or similar) to indicate when the function is found and executed. For example:
  
      if(typeof window.lateLoadTarget === "function"){
        console.log("Executing lateLoadTarget function.");
        window.lateLoadTarget();
      }
  
- **Error Handling:**  
  Even though defensive coding for `eventType` or `eventPayload` is not necessary per the requirement, it may be useful to add a try-catch block around the function call to log any unexpected exceptions.

- **Modularisation:**  
  As the extension is simple, it may not need further decomposition; however, encapsulating repeated logic in a helper function (if expanded in the future) could aid maintainability.

- **ES5 Compliance:**  
  Continue using ES5 syntax (e.g. `var` instead of `let/const`, function expressions instead of arrow functions) to ensure the code remains compatible with environments that do not support ES2015+ features.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ownership and Documentation:**  
  Clearly assign responsibility for this extension within the development team. Maintain up-to-date documentation, including any modifications or extensions of its functionality.

- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Test in environments where `lateLoadTarget` is both defined and undefined.  
  - Verify that the type-check correctly prevents non-function variables from triggering execution.  
  - Ensure that any changes to the global `lateLoadTarget` do not inadvertently break dependent functionality.

- **Change Management:**  
  Log changes within version control (e.g. Git) to track modifications over time. Include comments in commit messages clarifying updates to the extension’s logic.

- **Future Enhancements:**  
  If additional functionality is required, consider refactoring the extension into a more comprehensive module that can handle various late load event scenarios, with parameterisation for different targets or execution contexts.
