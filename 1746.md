# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name**: Initial c119 code
- **ID**: 1746
- **Type**: JavaScript Code
- **Scope**: 1495
- **Execution Frequency**: On each page load (as part of the Tealium iQ processing)

### Summary
The Initial c119 code extension is designed to scrape job-related metadata from specific sections of a webpage, ensuring that only pages in English are processed. The extension captures key elements related to job postings, such as job title, salary range, and application details. This information is then formatted into an analytics payload, which can be used for further tracking and analysis within tools such as Adobe Analytics.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables

- **scepRootSelector**: A CSS selector to identify the root element containing the job metadata (only for English pages).
- **qsa**: A utility function that mimics `querySelectorAll` but returns results as an array rather than a NodeList.
- **headerElements**: An array containing possible header tags to identify the job title.
- **clickableElements**: An array of HTML elements that can be interacted with, like links and buttons.
- **jobDetailsSelector, snippetSelector, contentSelector**: Specific selectors used to identify various parts of the job listing.

### Logic Flow
1. **Element Identification**: The extension first checks the page's language and identifies a root element for content scraping.
2. **Data Extraction**:
   - It collects job detail entries into an array.
   - Each job entry gathers relevant elements: title, apply buttons, snippet data, and content snippets.
3. **Data Formatting**:
   - The extracted data is structured and cleansed to create a payload that can be sent for analytics.
   - Special handling is present for salary ranges and end dates to ensure they are tracked in the correct format.

### Dependencies
The code relies on:
- **DOM APIs**: Utilises `document.querySelector` and `document.querySelectorAll`.
- **Tealium iQ Variables**: The extension expects the presence of `eventType`, `eventPayload`, and `tagObject` to execute properly.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Scenario
On a standard job listing page:
- The extension kicks in, checks for the English language, and scrapes data related to the job posting. 
- An analytics payload is generated that includes:
  - Job title
  - Salary from and to
  - End date
  - Other metadata formatted for downstream processing.

### Edge Cases
1. **Non-English Pages**: If the page language is not English, the extension terminates early, and no data is scraped or sent.
2. **Missing Elements**: If certain expected elements (like apply buttons or snippets) are missing, the extension gracefully handles this by not including them in the analytics payload.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Language Validation**: The extension only processes pages where the `lang` attribute is set to "en". Any other language settings will result in early termination.
- **Assumption of DOM Structure**: The extension presupposes a certain HTML structure. Changes in the page structure may break the functionality, requiring adjustments to the selectors.
- **No Error Handling**: The current implementation does not log errors or handle unexpected situations robustly, which might make troubleshooting difficult.

### Potential Conflicts
- This extension could conflict with other scripts that manipulate the same DOM elements. Care should be taken to ensure there are no overlapping handlers or alterations to the elements processed.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Implement Defensive Checks**: Consider adding checks to ensure that elements retrieved by the selectors exist before attempting to access their properties.
- **Modularize**: Break down the code into smaller functions that handle specific tasks, making it easier to manage and test.
- **Documentation**: Include inline comments throughout the code to improve clarity and maintainability for future developers.
- **String Handling**: Consider standardising how strings are handled, especially for metadata extraction, to ensure no empty values are sent in the analytics payload.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ownership**: Designate a team member responsible for maintaining this extension and ensuring its continued functionality with updates to webpages or analytics requirements.
- **Testing Guidelines**: Regular testing should be conducted, especially after any changes to the HTML structures of the target pages or related extensions.
- **Versioning**: Implement a version control system to track changes made to this script over time.

By documenting the extension comprehensively, future developers can understand its structure, functionality, and any implications it may have in a broader context. Ensure this documentation is stored alongside the codebase for easy access and reference.
