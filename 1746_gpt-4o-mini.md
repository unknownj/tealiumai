# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation

## 1. Extension Overview
- **Name**: Initial c119 code
- **ID**: 1746
- **Type**: JavaScript Code
- **Scope**: 1495
- **Execution Frequency**: On page load

### Summary
This extension is designed to scrape job-related metadata from a specific web page structure that is only valid when the page's language is set to English. It captures details such as job title, salary range, application buttons, and other metadata snippets to facilitate analytics tracking. By collating this information into a structured payload, the extension aids in the seamless integration of job page interactions into analytics systems, allowing for better insights and tracking of user engagement.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables:
- **scepRootSelector**: CSS selector used to identify the main content area of the page.
- **scepRoot**: The root HTML element retrieved using the above selector.
- **qsa**: A utility function replicating `querySelectorAll` functionality for a specific context and returning an array format.
- **headerElements**: An array defining header types (h1 to h6) to locate the most prominent job title.
- **clickableElements**: An array of clickable element types such as 'a' and 'button'.
- **jobDetailsElementArray**: An array of job detail containers found on the page using the defined selectors.

### Logic Flow:
1. The extension verifies the presence of the English language root element.
2. It collects job detail entries on the page and initializes an array of job data.
3. The extension processes each job detail to extract:
   - **Title**: The most relevant header element.
   - **Apply Buttons**: All buttons related to job applications.
   - **Metadata Snippets**: Additional details stored in sidebars and main body elements.
4. It formats the extracted data, transforming specific fields (like salary range and end date) into a structured format.
5. An analytics payload is constructed with relevant metadata, preparing it for tracking purposes.

### Dependencies:
- The extension relies on standard DOM manipulation functions, specifically `document.querySelector` and `document.querySelectorAll`.
- It does not depend on any external libraries or frameworks.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Conditions:
- **Scenario**: User visits an English job details page.
  - **Input**: The page successfully loads with the necessary structure in English.
  - **Output**: The extension extracts and logs the job title, salary range, job end date, and application buttons.

### Edge Conditions:
- **Scenario**: The page does not contain any job details due to missing HTML elements.
  - **Input**: The extension encounters an unexpected structural change, leading to `scepRoot` being null.
  - **Output**: The extension gracefully exits without error, preventing any unintended behaviour.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas
- **Language Dependency**: The extension is strictly reliant on the page being in English. Pages in other languages will not work as intended.
- **Structural Changes**: If the expected DOM structure changes (e.g., class names or element hierarchy), the extension may fail to capture data correctly.
- **Impressions Handling**: There is a note indicating the intention to add event handlers to "Apply" buttons; this functionality is not yet implemented and may lead to incomplete tracking of interactions.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring
- **Defensive Checks**: Implement checks to confirm that elements exist before attempting to access their properties (e.g., using conditionals).
- **Code Style**: Consider following a consistent coding style, particularly around naming conventions and comments for improved readability.
- **Modularisation**: Break the code into functions to isolate responsibilities (e.g., separate functions for metadata extraction, logging, and payload preparation) for easier testing and maintenance.
- **Error Logging**: Incorporate error handling mechanisms (e.g., `try/catch`) to log potential issues without halting execution.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes
- **Ownership**: Designate ownership of this extension to a specific team member for accountability.
- **Ongoing Maintenance**: Regularly review the extension with updates to the underlying web structure or tracking requirements.
- **Testing Guidelines**: Establish a process for testing upon any changes, including regression checks to ensure existing functionality is not broken.
