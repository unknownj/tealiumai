## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Initial c119 code  
- **Extension ID:** 1746 (Internal), 100036 (Library/Reference ID)  
- **Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** 1495  
- **Execution Frequency:**  
  - The extension runs each time the page is loaded (or when the corresponding event triggers execution), provided that the page contains an HTML element matching the selector `html[lang=en] div#main`.

**Summary:**  
This extension is designed to scrape and process job details data from specific sections of a webpage. It:
- Validates that the page is in English (ensuring accurate text scraping),
- Locates a specific container designated for job details,
- Extracts key elements such as headers, ‘Apply’ buttons, and various metadata snippets,
- Processes these data points using custom logic (including transformations like salary range rounding and date format conversion),
- Compiles the extracted metadata into a structured analytics payload which is subsequently logged (and can be forwarded to analytics platforms).

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables & Selectors

- **scepRootSelector:**  
  - Contains the CSS selector `"html[lang=en] div#main"` to ensure that the extension only runs on English pages.
- **scepRoot:**  
  - The first DOM element matching `scepRootSelector`. If not found, the script exits immediately.
- **qsa Function:**  
  - A custom function to perform `querySelectorAll` with an optional context.  
  - Converts the NodeList into an Array for easier manipulation.
- **headerElements & clickableElements:**  
  - Arrays containing HTML tag names (`h1` to `h6` for headers, `a` and `button` for clickable items) used to locate the title and ‘Apply’ buttons.
- **jobDetailsSelector, snippetSelector, contentSelector:**  
  - Specific selectors for:
    - The main job details container (`div.c-119-job-details`),
    - Sidebar metadata snippets (`ul.summary-snippets li.snippet`),
    - Inline or main body metadata snippets (`div.details-full .snippet`).

### Data Processing & Logic Flow

1. **DOM Validation:**  
   - The extension begins by querying the DOM for the element defined by `scepRootSelector`.  
   - If the required element is not present, the extension terminates early.

2. **Data Element Collection:**  
   - Uses the `qsa` function to gather all job detail containers using `jobDetailsSelector`.
   - Processes each container to extract:
     - The highest-ranking header element found (i.e. prioritises `h1` over `h2`, etc.) as the job title.
     - An array of ‘Apply’ buttons from clickable elements with the class `.apply`.
     - Two sets of metadata snippets: one from sidebar snippets (`snippetSelector`) and another from inline snippets (`contentSelector`).

3. **Data Transformation & Aggregation:**  
   - Iterates over each job details object and:
     - Extracts the text content from the title header.
     - Processes each metadata snippet by splitting the element’s class attribute (removing the common token `"snippet"`) to establish a key and mapping it to its text content.
     - Combines sidebar and inline snippets into a single metadata object.
     - Performs special transformations:
       - **Salary Range Conversion:**  
         - If a `salary-range` key exists, removes non-numeric characters, splits on the hyphen, rounds each number to the nearest 5,000 and assigns these as `salary-from` and `salary-to`; the original `salary-range` entry is then removed.
       - **End Date Formatting:**  
         - Converts the `end-date` into an ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD) after adjusting the hour to mitigate timezone issues.
   - Constructs an analytics payload by:
     - Creating a fixed-order metadata template (`jobMetadataTemplate`) to ensure consistent key ordering (e.g. "location-city", "posted", "end-date", "worker-type", "salary-from", "salary-to").
     - Joining the metadata values from the job details into a delimited string using "!" as the separator.
     - Including the job title and a reference (if available).

4. **Output:**  
   - Finally, the payload is logged to the console for downstream consumption (e.g. by Adobe Analytics) or further processing.

### Dependencies

- **DOM & Browser-Specific Objects:**  
  - Reliant on the global `document` object and browser-specific APIs such as `querySelectorAll`.
- **Global Variables:**  
  - Expects the variables `eventType`, `eventPayload`, and `tagObject` to be passed via the IIFE; these are assumed to always be available as per requirements.
- **ES5 Syntax:**  
  - Uses traditional function expressions and `var` for variable declarations to maintain compatibility with ES5 environments.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Conditions

- **Scenario:**  
  A user visits a job details page that meets the following conditions:
  - The HTML element has the attribute `lang="en"`.
  - There exists a `div#main` container containing a `div.c-119-job-details` element.
- **Data Flow:**  
  - The script successfully locates the container and extracts the job title, ‘Apply’ buttons, and metadata snippets.
  - The salary range is interpreted, rounded, and split into two separate variables.
  - The end date is converted to ISO format.
  - The final payload, including job title and metadata organised in the specified order, is logged to the console.
- **Example Payload Output:**  
  {  
    title: "Senior Developer",  
    metadata: "London!12 Aug 2023!2023-09-12!Full-Time!50000!70000",  
    reference: "JOB12345"  
  }

### Edge Conditions

- **Missing SCEP Root:**  
  - If the page does not contain an element matching `html[lang=en] div#main`, the extension terminates without processing further, thereby avoiding any unintended data processing.
- **Incomplete Data:**  
  - If certain metadata fields (e.g., `salary-range` or `end-date`) are missing, the mapping function gracefully assigns an empty string "" for those keys in the final payload.
- **Multiple Containers:**  
  - Although the code is initially built for a single job details container, it allows for the potential presence of multiple containers. The payload is constructed using only the first element, meaning subsequent containers are ignored unless further extended.
- **Non-Standard Formatting:**  
  - If the salary field or date field does not follow expected formats, the conversion routines may yield unexpected or empty results without crashing the script.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Language Dependency:**  
  - The code strictly checks for English-language pages. Pages with a different language attribute will cause the script to exit early, potentially skipping important job data.
- **DOM Structure Reliance:**  
  - The extension is heavily dependent on the CSS selectors (`div.c-119-job-details`, `ul.summary-snippets li.snippet`, `div.details-full .snippet`). Any structural changes in the webpage may lead to data extraction failures.
- **Single Container Assumption:**  
  - While the mapping function supports multiple job details containers, only the payload from the first container is processed for analytics.
- **Event Handlers:**  
  - The functionality for attaching event handlers to the 'Apply' buttons and tracking impressions is noted as a TODO. This may cause incomplete user interaction tracking in the current version.
- **Data Parsing:**  
  - The conversion of salary ranges and dates assumes that the text content is uniformly formatted. Unexpected formats might lead to erroneous or skipped transformations.
- **Conflict with Other Scripts:**  
  - As with any DOM-manipulating code, there is potential for conflicts with other Tealium extensions or external scripts that alter the same elements or use similar selectors.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Modularisation:**  
  - Organise the code into separate functions or modules to improve readability and maintainability.  
  - For example, create distinct functions for extracting elements, transforming salary ranges, and formatting dates.
- **Defensive Coding Enhancements:**  
  - Although defensive checks for `eventType`, `eventPayload`, and `tagObject` are not required, consider adding further checks for element existence (e.g. verifying that `jobDetailsObject.titleElement` is non-null before accessing `textContent`).
  - Validate that text content exists before invoking string operations such as `replace` or `split`.
- **Error Handling:**  
  - Implement error handling (using try/catch blocks if necessary) around data parsing routines to ensure that malformed data does not disrupt the entire payload creation process.
- **Documentation & Comments:**  
  - Increase inline documentation for non-obvious transformations (such as the rounding mechanism in salary conversion) to aid future developers.
- **Future-proofing Selectors:**  
  - Define and potentially externalise key selectors so that adjustments can be made without modifying the core logic.
- **Maintain Compatibility:**  
  - Continue adhering to ES5 best practices (avoid using ES2015+ syntax, arrow functions, or newer variable declarations such as let/const) to ensure support across all required browsers.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  - Regularly review and test the selectors and data extraction logic as the webpage’s DOM structure may change over time.
  - Maintain unit tests for key functions (e.g. metadata extraction and transformation functions) to quickly identify breaking changes due to DOM updates.
- **Ownership & Versioning:**  
  - Clearly document ownership and version history within the code repository. Use comments at the top of the file to track modifications and responsible developers.
- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Ensure that each update is verified across multiple pages (e.g. pages with complete, partial, and unusual job details structures) to cover edge cases.
  - Consider integration testing with downstream analytics to verify that the data payload format is maintained.
- **Collaboration:**  
  - Encourage peer reviews when making significant changes, particularly to the data transformation logic.  
  - Include clear commit messages and update documentation as part of the change management process.
