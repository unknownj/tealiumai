# Qualtrics Load Rules (monz woz ere) Extension Documentation

This document provides a detailed overview and explanation of the Tealium iQ extension used to set Qualtrics Zone information. It covers the extension's purpose, code structure, usage scenarios, limitations, recommendations for refactoring, and guidance for future maintenance.

---

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Qualtrics load rules (monz woz ere)
- **ID:** 1748 (Internal Extension ID)
- **Extension ID:** 100036
- **Type:** Javascript Code
- **Scope:** Before Load Rules
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Always

**Summary:**  
This extension is designed to determine an appropriate Qualtrics Zone based on a set of predefined load rules. It scans through an array of rule objects that specify target domains, paths, and ignore conditions. Depending on the current URL and/or path (accessed via the global event payload object), the script selects the first eligible rule and attaches the corresponding Qualtrics ZoneID and Zone Name to the event payload. This allows subsequent processes or integrations (such as Qualtrics surveys) to utilise the appropriate configuration.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables

- **loadRules:**  
  An array of rule objects. Each entry defines a load rule by specifying properties such as:
  - `name`: A descriptive name for the rule.
  - `urls`: An array of domain strings (or paths, in certain cases) where the rule applies.
  - `paths`: An optional array of URL path prefixes that the rule should match.
  - `ignore`: An optional array of path prefixes to be excluded.
  - `ZoneID`: The identifier for the Qualtrics zone that will be attached if the rule matches.

- **eligibleRules:**  
  A filtered list derived from the `loadRules` array. Only rules that:
  - Have a `ZoneID` defined.
  - Do not have an `ignore` match condition (evaluated using the global `LBGAnalytics.Q` function with a custom condition string).
  - And meet matching criteria for `paths` and `urls` (matching can be partial using the `startsWith` method or full match, with support for wildcard `"*"`).
  
### Logic Flow

1. **Initialisation:**  
   The extension is encapsulated in an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) that accepts two parameters—`a` (eventType) and `b` (eventPayload). This ensures the code runs immediately within its defined scope.

2. **Filtering Load Rules:**  
   The script iterates over the `loadRules` array using the `filter` method to build the `eligibleRules` list:
   - **ZoneID Verification:**  
     If a rule does not specify a `ZoneID`, it is ignored.
     
   - **Ignore Block Check:**  
     If a rule has an `ignore` property, the script builds an array of conditions (e.g., "CanonicalPath contains /business") and utilises the external function `LBGAnalytics.Q` to determine if any ignore condition matches the current event payload. If a match is found, the rule is skipped.
     
   - **Path and URL Matching:**  
     - If a rule specifies `paths`:
       - If the wildcard `"*"` exists in paths, the rule automatically qualifies.
       - Otherwise, it checks whether `b.CanonicalPath` starts with any of the defined path prefixes.
       - Additionally, it evaluates if the `urls` condition passes.  
     - If no `paths` are specified:
       - The rule qualifies if the `urls` property contains `"*"` or if `LBGAnalytics.Q(rule.urls)` returns true.
     
3. **Assigning Qualtrics Properties:**  
   When one or more eligible rules are found, the extension assigns:
   - `b.QualtricsZoneID` – set to the `ZoneID` of the first eligible rule.
   - `b.QualtricsZoneName` – set to the `name` of the first eligible rule.

### Dependencies

- **Global Objects:**  
  - `eventPayload (b)`: Assumed to be an object containing properties such as `CanonicalPath` that represent the current URL conditions.
  - `LBGAnalytics`:  
    The extension relies on the external global `LBGAnalytics` object and, in particular, its method `Q` to evaluate whether specific URL or ignore conditions are met. The proper functioning of this code depends on the availability and correct implementation of `LBGAnalytics.Q`.

- **Environment Requirements:**  
  The code is written in ES5, ensuring compatibility with browsers that support older JavaScript standards.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Matching a Rule Based on URL and Path

- **Input:**  
  - `b.CanonicalPath`: "/businessaccount/start"
  - Domain is determined via `LBGAnalytics.Q(rule.urls)` (for example, the rule with `urls: ['www.lloydsbank.com']` and `paths: ['/business']` is evaluated).
  
- **Flow:**  
  1. The rule "QAL : BOSLYD : Business Banking Public 2" is processed.
  2. The `ignore` property (if present) is checked and does not match the current path.
  3. The script checks if `b.CanonicalPath` starts with "/business" and if the domain check returns true.
  
- **Output:**  
  - `b.QualtricsZoneID` is set to '0w77Gwuaun8BJpr'.
  - `b.QualtricsZoneName` is set to 'QAL : BOSLYD : Business Banking Public 2'.

### Scenario 2: Rule with Wildcard

- **Input:**  
  - For a rule that uses `"*"` in the `urls` array (i.e. "*") or `paths` array.
  
- **Flow:**  
  1. The wildcard condition is detected.
  2. The rule qualifies automatically without further domain or path checks.
  
- **Output:**  
  The corresponding `QualtricsZoneID` and `name` from that rule are attached to the event payload.

### Scenario 3: No Matching Rule

- **Input:**  
  - `b.CanonicalPath` and other matching criteria do not satisfy any rule in the list.
  
- **Flow:**  
  1. No rule qualifies.
  2. The extension does not assign `QualtricsZoneID` or `QualtricsZoneName` to `b`.

- **Output:**  
  The event payload remains without Qualtrics zone identifiers, potentially triggering a default behaviour downstream.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Dependency on LBGAnalytics.Q:**  
  The extension relies heavily on the function `LBGAnalytics.Q` for evaluating conditions. If this function is not available or does not behave as expected, the rule filtering will fail.

- **Rule Ordering:**  
  Only the first eligible rule is used if multiple matches exist. This means rule order in the `loadRules` array is critical and can lead to unexpected behaviour if not managed carefully.

- **Ignoring Edge Cases:**  
  The script does not provide detailed logging or error handling. In situations where multiple rules might be applicable, or none qualify, there is no notification thrown to the Tealium dashboard.

- **Global Namespace Usage:**  
  Since the script operates on global objects (e.g. `eventPayload`, `LBGAnalytics`), potential conflicts can occur if other scripts modify or use these objects inconsistently.

- **Path Matching:**  
  The use of `startsWith` for detecting path matches is simplistic. It may not be sufficient for more complex URL matching scenarios.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks & Logging:**  
  - Introduce try-catch blocks or logging to capture cases where unexpected data structures are encountered.
  - Consider logging warnings when no eligible rules are found or when potential conflicts occur.

- **Modularisation:**  
  - Separate rule matching logic into smaller helper functions. For instance, create functions for evaluating ignore rules, path matching, and URL matching.
  - Even though ES5 must be supported, simple function declarations can improve readability and maintainability.

- **Rule Order and Prioritisation:**  
  - Document the intended order of rules explicitly, and if needed, provide a mechanism to prioritise matching explicitly rather than relying solely on array order.

- **Enhance Condition Checks:**  
  - Improve the matching logic to allow for more complex URL and path structures if necessary.
  - Consider additional checks for case sensitivity or URL parameters if this becomes an issue.

- **Documentation & Comments:**  
  - Add more inline comments and documentation within the code to explain why certain decisions (like wildcard handling) are made. This is especially useful for future developers working with legacy code.

*(Note: Do not implement ES6 features such as arrow functions, let/const or template literals as ES5 compatibility is required.)*

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ownership & Versioning:**  
  - Decide on an owner or team responsible for this extension. Maintain version control in the Tealium iQ environment and external repositories as appropriate.
  
- **Testing:**  
  - Develop unit tests or a test plan to validate that the extension sets the correct Qualtrics zone based on different URL and path scenarios.
  - Regularly test the integration with the `LBGAnalytics` global object to ensure its dependencies remain intact.
  
- **Updating Load Rules:**  
  - When updating the `loadRules` array (e.g. adding or removing rules), ensure thorough testing across scenarios to verify that no unintended behaviours occur.
  
- **Code Reviews & Documentation:**  
  - Incorporate peer reviews when changes are made to ensure that the logic remains clear and that modifications do not introduce conflicts.
  - Keep this documentation updated as changes are implemented.

- **Error Handling:**  
  - Although the current implementation does not throw errors on rule mismatch, future enhancements could include error alerts or log aggregations to assist in debugging and operational monitoring.
