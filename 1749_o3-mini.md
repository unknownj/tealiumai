# Client Hints Tealium iQ Extension Documentation

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Client Hints  
- **ID:** 1749  
- **Extension Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** Pre Loader  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Once  

### Summary
The Client Hints extension retrieves high-entropy client hints from the browser’s User-Agent Client Hints API. It selects specific properties (brands, mobile, model, platform, and platformVersion) and sets corresponding values into the datalayer using a standard naming convention ("ClientHint_[property]"). It also transforms some of the retrieved data (e.g. combining platform and version, parsing brands into a string) and ensures that any previous client hint data is removed from the datalayer before fetching new values. This is particularly useful for ensuring that client information is up to date and formatted consistently for analytics and tracking purposes.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables & Global Dependencies

- **clientHints**  
  A hardcoded array containing string identifiers:  
  - "brands"
  - "mobile"
  - "model"
  - "platform"
  - "platformVersion"  

- **navigator.userAgentData**  
  This is the global browser API object that is used to fetch high-entropy data. The method `getHighEntropyValues()` is invoked with the `clientHints` array.

- **LBGAnalytics.datalayer**  
  A global object/interface that is used to set, retrieve, and listen to changes on data-layer values throughout the application. This extension depends on its API methods:
    - `set()`: To store processed client hint values.
    - `on("get", ...)`: To remove previous client hint values on retrieval.

### Logic Flow

1. **Fetching High-Entropy Data:**  
   The extension begins by using `navigator.userAgentData.getHighEntropyValues(clientHints)`. This returns a promise that resolves to an object (`ua`) containing the requested values.

2. **Processing and Storing Client Hint Values:**  
   Once the promise resolves, the script iterates over each key in the returned object (`ua`):
   - **Conditional Type Checks:**  
     Depending on the type of the value:
     - **String & Number:** Directly stored in the datalayer.
     - **Boolean:** Converted to "Y" for `true` and "N" for `false`.
     - **Object:** Converted into a JSON string before storing.
   - The key name used is a prepended string "ClientHint_" concatenated with the property (e.g. `ClientHint_platform`).

3. **Combining Client Hint Data:**  
   Additional datalayer variables are set using functions to combine or transform the stored data:
   - **ClientHintPlatform:**  
     Retrieves the `ClientHint_platform` and `ClientHint_platformVersion` from the datalayer and concatenates them if available.
   - **ClientHintBrands:**  
     Attempts to parse the JSON string from `ClientHint_brands`, maps through the resulting array to combine `brand` and `version` values, replaces any semicolons within the string, and joins multiple results with a semicolon.
   - **ClientHintMobile:**  
     Directly returns the value of `ClientHint_mobile`.

4. **Cleanup of Previous Data:**  
   A datalayer event listener on the "get" event is registered. Before data is retrieved, it iterates over the keys in the current datalayer and deletes any key that starts with "ClientHint_". This ensures that outdated client hint values are cleared before new processing occurs.

### Dependency Summary
- The extension relies on:
  - The browser’s `navigator.userAgentData` API for accessing client hints.
  - The global `LBGAnalytics.datalayer` object for setting and managing datalayer values.
- It assumes that the datalayer API supports operations like `set` for both static values and functions, as well as an event listener through `on("get", …)`.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Normal Operation
- **Initial State:**  
  No client hint values are present in the datalayer.
- **Process:**  
  1. The extension fetches the client hint values (e.g., platform: "Windows", platformVersion: "10", brands: `[{"brand":"Chrome","version":"107"}]`, etc.).
  2. Appropriate conversions are applied, and values are stored (e.g., `ClientHint_platform` = "Windows", `ClientHint_platformVersion` = "10", `ClientHint_brands` = JSON string representation of the brands array).
  3. Additional variables such as `ClientHintPlatform` and `ClientHintBrands` are created by combining or reformatting the basic values.
- **Outcome:**  
  The analytics datalayer now contains up-to-date, combined, and formatted client information.

### Scenario 2: Edge Conditions
- **Data Missing / Empty Strings:**  
  If a fetched property is an empty string or undefined, it will not be set (or is checked before setting).
- **Error in Data Parsing:**  
  If the brands JSON string cannot be parsed (e.g. in case of malformed data), the try/catch block ensures that errors are silently handled and the datalayer value defaults to `undefined`.
- **Unexpected Value Types:**  
  Any unexpected types will be stringified (if an object) or bypassed if empty, ensuring that the system does not crash due to unforeseen input.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **API Support:**  
  The extension relies heavily on `navigator.userAgentData.getHighEntropyValues()`, which may not be available in older browsers. There is no fallback provided in the script.

- **Error Handling:**  
  Error handling is minimal (try/catch blocks simply swallows errors), making debugging potentially more challenging, since no logging or error message is provided.

- **Overwriting Datalayer Keys:**  
  All keys starting with "ClientHint_" are wiped out on every datalayer "get" event. This might interfere with other extensions that use similar naming conventions if they are not coordinated.

- **Data Transformation Risks:**  
  The parsing and string manipulation of the brands data assumes a consistent structure. Any deviation in the JSON structure can result in the entire transformation returning `undefined`.

- **Global Dependencies:**  
  The extension assumes that the `LBGAnalytics.datalayer` object is present and properly initialised. Conflicts or differences in implementation can cause unexpected behaviour.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Improve Error Handling:**  
  Consider logging errors to a console or a debugging service for better visibility during development rather than silently failing.

- **Validate API Availability:**  
  Implement checks to verify that `navigator.userAgentData` and its methods exist before invoking them. This could include a fallback strategy for unsupported browsers.

- **Modularise Code:**  
  Break the code into smaller, reusable functions. For example, separate functions could be created for:
  - Fetching client hints.
  - Processing individual types.
  - Combining fields (e.g. `ClientHintPlatform` calculation).
  - Cleanup of datalayer keys.
  
- **Defensive Checks:**  
  Even though certain parameters like `eventType` and `eventPayload` are guaranteed, consider additional defensive checks for data integrity where transformations (e.g. JSON parsing) are performed.

- **Documentation Inline:**  
  Embed inline comments within the code to explain sections of the logic — further aiding future developers in understanding the control flow and data transformations.

- **ES5 Compliance:**  
  Ensure all refactored code remains in ES5 syntax. Avoid using ES6-specific functionalities such as arrow functions, const/let, or template literals.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**
  - Regularly test on multiple browsers to ensure compatibility, especially as browser support for `navigator.userAgentData` evolves.
  - Incorporate logging or notifications in the error catch blocks to easily diagnose issues during runtime.
  - Monitor the behaviour of the datalayer listeners to ensure they do not unintentionally delete other necessary data keys.

- **Ownership & Versioning:**
  - Assign clear owner(s) for the extension who are responsible for updates or regression tracking.
  - Maintain version control by including comments about major changes or reasons for modifications within the code or commit messages.

- **Testing Guidelines:**
  - Ensure unit testing covers:
    - Successful retrieval and formatting of all client hint values.
    - The correct composition of combined datalayer fields (ClientHintPlatform and ClientHintBrands).
    - The cleanup process to ensure no residual keys remain prior to new fetches.
  - Conduct cross-browser tests to ascertain handling in browsers lacking `navigator.userAgentData`.
  
- **Further Enhancements:**
  - Consider building a fallback mechanism for unsupported browsers.
  - Evaluate integrating with existing logging frameworks to capture and report errors during client hint processing.
