# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the "Scrub SW Protect instances of Business User ID" Tealium iQ extension. It covers the extension's purpose, code breakdown, usage scenarios, known limitations, recommendations for refactoring, and maintenance guidelines.

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name**: Scrub SW Protect instances of Business User ID  
- **ID**: 1751  
- **Extension ID (Metadata)**: 100036  
- **Type**: Javascript Code  
- **Scope**: After Load Rules  
- **Execution Frequency**: Run Always  

### Summary

This extension is designed to anonymise sensitive information by checking whether the current webpage URL contains the substring "swprotect". If this condition is met and the `eventPayload` includes a property called `BusinessUserID`, the extension scrubs this property by replacing its value with the string "(redacted)". This ensures that in any SW Protect related pages, the business user identifier is masked for privacy and security reasons.

---

## 2. Code Explanation

The extension is implemented as an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) with two parameters. Below is a detailed explanation of the code:

```javascript
(function(a,b){
  if(b.BusinessUserID && window.location.pathname.toLowerCase().indexOf("swprotect") >= 0){
      b.BusinessUserID = "(redacted)";
  }
})(eventType, eventPayload);
```

### Key Variables

- **a**: Represents `eventType`. This parameter is passed to the function but is not utilised in the current logic.
- **b**: Represents `eventPayload`, which is an object containing event data. This object should include the `BusinessUserID` property if set.
- **window.location.pathname**: A global property that returns the path segment of the current URL. It is converted to lowercase to ensure a case-insensitive search for the substring "swprotect".

### Logic Flow

1. **Check for BusinessUserID**:  
   The code first verifies that the `eventPayload` (variable `b`) includes a truthy `BusinessUserID`.

2. **Check URL Pathname**:  
   The pathname portion of the current URL is converted to lowercase. The code then looks for the substring "swprotect" within this pathname using the `indexOf` method. A result equal to or greater than 0 indicates that "swprotect" exists within the URL.

3. **Scrubbing the Data**:  
   If both conditions (presence of `BusinessUserID` and URL containing "swprotect") are met, the extension replaces the value of `b.BusinessUserID` with the string "(redacted)".

### Dependencies

- **Global Objects**:  
  - `window`: Used to access the current URL's `location.pathname`.
- **Tealium Provided Variables**:  
  - `eventType` and `eventPayload` are guaranteed to be available in the extension’s context.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Normal Operation

- **Input Conditions**:  
  - The URL is `https://example.com/path/swprotect/details` (contains "swprotect").
  - `eventPayload` contains: `{ BusinessUserID: "12345ABC" }`.
  
- **Output**:  
  - The `BusinessUserID` property in `eventPayload` is replaced, resulting in `{ BusinessUserID: "(redacted)" }`.

### Scenario 2: BusinessUserID Not Present

- **Input Conditions**:  
  - The URL is `https://example.com/path/swprotect/details`.
  - `eventPayload` does not include a valid `BusinessUserID`. It might be undefined or falsy.
  
- **Output**:  
  - The code does nothing; `eventPayload` remains unchanged.

### Scenario 3: URL Doesn’t Contain "swprotect"

- **Input Conditions**:  
  - The URL is `https://example.com/path/no-special-protection`.
  - `eventPayload` contains: `{ BusinessUserID: "12345ABC" }`.
  
- **Output**:  
  - Since the URL does not contain "swprotect", the code does nothing; `BusinessUserID` retains its original value.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **URL Dependency**:  
  The scrubbing is solely dependent on the URL containing the substring "swprotect". If there's a need to adapt to multiple variations or additional paths, the condition would require modification.

- **String Matching**:  
  The check for "swprotect" is done using a simple substring match. This might lead to unintended matches if "swprotect" is part of an unrelated longer path or query parameter.

- **Conflict with Other Extensions**:  
  - If another extension also manipulates `eventPayload.BusinessUserID`, there could be conflicts. The order of execution (scope: After Load Rules) should be considered.
  - Modifications by subsequent extensions may override this scrubbed value if not properly sequenced.

- **Lack of Logging**:  
  There is no logging mechanism to trace when scrubbing occurs. This can make debugging or audit trailing more challenging.

---

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Modularise the Code**:  
  Consider abstracting the URL check and scrubbing logic into smaller, reusable functions for clarity and potential reuse in similar extensions.

- **Define Constants**:  
  Although ES5 is required, using variables like `var TARGET_SUBSTRING = "swprotect";` at the top could improve readability and ease future modifications.

- **Commenting**:  
  Include inline comments to explain the purpose of each code block, helping future developers understand the logic quickly.

- **Error Handling (if applicable)**:  
  Although defensive coding for `eventType` and `eventPayload` isn't required, additional logging or alerts may be useful in more complex scenarios.

Example Refactoring Suggestion:

```javascript
(function(eventType, eventPayload){
  // Define the target substring to search in the URL
  var targetSubstring = "swprotect";
  
  // Convert pathname to lowercase for case-insensitive check
  var pathLower = window.location.pathname.toLowerCase();
  
  // Check if BusinessUserID exists and URL contains the target substring
  if(eventPayload.BusinessUserID && pathLower.indexOf(targetSubstring) >= 0){
      eventPayload.BusinessUserID = "(redacted)";
  }
})(eventType, eventPayload);
```

*Note: This refactoring suggestion maintains ES5 compatibility while improving readability and maintainability.*

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance**:  
  - Regularly review the URL matching logic to ensure that it meets evolving business requirements.
  - Verify that no other extensions conflict with the scrubbing process, especially if changes are made to eventPayload in other parts of your tag management strategy.

- **Ownership and Code Reviews**:  
  - Assign clear ownership for this extension. Ensure that any future modifications or bug fixes are documented in version control.
  - Incorporate code reviews focused on potential side effects on critical data elements like `BusinessUserID`.

- **Testing Guidelines**:  
  - Develop test cases for both positive scenarios (where scrubbing is expected) and negative scenarios (where it is not). 
  - Validate the extension using multiple URL cases, ensuring that only the intended pages trigger the scrubbing.
  - Consider regression testing if changes are made to related extensions to prevent unexpected behaviour.

- **Documentation Updates**:  
  - Keep this documentation up-to-date with any changes to the extension logic.
  - Include example URLs and payloads in the README or comment headers within the extension code for context.
