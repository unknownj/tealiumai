# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name**: CWR triggerView Proof of Concept
- **ID**: 1752
- **Type**: Javascript Code
- **Scope**: Pre Loader
- **Execution Frequency**: Run Once

### Summary
This extension is designed to monitor the webpage's URL and trigger specific analytics events based on the presence of designated sections when the user navigates to the "/personal/cwa/cwr-hub/" path. It seeks to enhance tracking of user interactions by signalling when relevant elements are present on the page, allowing for better user behaviour insights.

---

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- `window.location.pathname`: Retrieves the current URL path for analysis.
- `LBGAnalytics.target`: An object that allows interaction with the analytics system, equipped with a method for detecting elements on the page.

### Logic Flow
1. The code begins by checking if the current URL path starts with `"/personal/cwa/cwr-hub/"`.
2. If the condition is met and the `LBGAnalytics.target` object is available with the `fireWhenElementAvailable` method, the following actions occur:
   - `fireWhenElementAvailable("section.borrowing-options-section", "optionsVisible")`: This method is called to track visibility on the "borrowing options" section.
   - `fireWhenElementAvailable("section.explore-borrowing-options", "optionsHidden")`: This method is called to track the absence of elements in the "explore borrowing options" section.

### Dependencies
- The code depends on the presence of the global `LBGAnalytics` object. It assumes that `LBGAnalytics.target` has been defined elsewhere within the application and includes the method `fireWhenElementAvailable`.

---

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Flow
- When a user navigates to `/personal/cwa/cwr-hub/`, the extension identifies the URL, checks the availability of the specified sections, and fires events:
  - If `section.borrowing-options-section` is present, the event `optionsVisible` is triggered.
  - If `section.explore-borrowing-options` is present, the event `optionsHidden` is triggered.

### Edge Conditions
- If the user visits an unsupported URL that does not match the defined path, the extension will not execute, preventing unnecessary processing.
- If `LBGAnalytics.target` is not defined, the event triggers will not run, meaning no interactions will be tracked.

---

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Scope Limitation**: The extension is limited to the specified URL and will not operate outside of `/personal/cwa/cwr-hub/`, which might lead to missing analytics data if users navigate elsewhere.
- **Dependency on Global Object**: If there are changes to the `LBGAnalytics` object or if it is removed, the extension will cease to function.
- **Timing Issues**: The execution timing might cause race conditions if the elements are added after the script runs.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks**: Adding checks to ensure the existence of specific DOM elements could prevent potential runtime errors.
- **Code Style**: 
  - Consider using more descriptive variable names for enhanced clarity regarding their purpose.
  - Structure the checks using early returns to reduce unnecessary nested code and improve readability.
- **Modularisation**: If this piece of functionality expands, consider refactoring it into smaller, standalone functions for easier reuse and testing in the future:
  ```javascript
  function triggerAnalyticsEvent(eventName, elementName) {
      if (LBGAnalytics.target && LBGAnalytics.target.fireWhenElementAvailable) {
          LBGAnalytics.target.fireWhenElementAvailable(elementName, eventName);
      }
  }

  if (window.location.pathname.indexOf("/personal/cwa/cwr-hub/") === 0) {
      triggerAnalyticsEvent("optionsVisible", "section.borrowing-options-section");
      triggerAnalyticsEvent("optionsHidden", "section.explore-borrowing-options");
  }
  ```

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ownership**: Designate an owner for the extension responsible for updates and documentation to ensure ongoing relevance and accuracy.
- **Testing Guidelines**: 
  - Regularly test the extension in various environments to ensure compatibility as both the site structure and analytic frameworks evolve.
  - Monitor analytics data post-implementation for anomalies or missing data signals to troubleshoot promptly.
- **Documentation Review**: Establish a periodic review of this documentation to ensure it accurately reflects the current implementation and practices.
