# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: CWR triggerView Proof of Concept

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** CWR triggerView Proof of Concept  
- **ID:** 100036  
- **Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** Pre Loader  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Once  

### Summary
This extension serves as a proof of concept for triggering analytics events when specific sections of the webpage are available. It checks the URL path of the current page and ensures that certain elements are present on the DOM before firing events related to borrowing options. The primary purpose is to enable enhanced tracking of user interactions within targeted sections of a webpage, leading to more informed data-driven decisions.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables

- **`window.location.pathname`:** This property is utilized to determine the active URL path of the window.
- **`LBGAnalytics.target`:** A global object that allows interaction with the analytics framework, specifically for firing events when specific elements appear in the DOM.

### Logic Flow

1. **Pathname Check:** The code begins by examining the current pathname to check if it starts with `/personal/cwa/cwr-hub/`.
2. **Dependency Check:** It verifies that `LBGAnalytics.target` is defined and that the `fireWhenElementAvailable` method is accessible.
3. **Event Firing:** If both conditions are met, it triggers the following events:
   - `section.borrowing-options-section` with the event name `optionsVisible`
   - `section.explore-borrowing-options` with the event name `optionsHidden`

### Dependencies
This code depends on the presence of the `LBGAnalytics` global object and its `target` property. Specifically, it relies on the `fireWhenElementAvailable` method being defined and operational.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Conditions
- **Scenario:** User navigates to the page `/personal/cwa/cwr-hub/`.
- **Data Flow:** On entering the page, if both sections (`borrowing-options-section` and `explore-borrowing-options`) become available, the extension triggers the respective analytics events, indicating that the appropriate sections are visible or hidden.

### Edge Conditions
- **Scenario 1:** User does not navigate to the designated path.
  - **Result:** No events will be triggered as the first condition fails.
  
- **Scenario 2:** `LBGAnalytics.target` or the `fireWhenElementAvailable` method is undefined.
  - **Result:** No firing of events occurs, which may lead to a loss of tracking data for interactions within the targeted sections.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Path Sensitivity:** The pathname check is case-sensitive, meaning variations in path casing could result in failure to trigger analytics events.
- **Element Availability:** If element detection relies on dynamic loading, there may be instances where the events do not fire as expected if elements load after the script runs.
- **Dependencies Conflict:** Should there be any other extensions that modify or interfere with global objects or libraries, this extension may fail to operate correctly.

---

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks:** Consider adding conditional checks to ensure that the methods and properties being accessed on `LBGAnalytics.target` exist and are callable.
- **Code Style:** Use clear variable naming conventions. Implementing a naming structure that describes the actions being performed can enhance readability.
- **Modularisation:** Future versions could benefit from breaking down responsibilitiesâ€”consider creating helper functions for repetitive tasks like event firing.
  
Given the constraints of supporting ES5, ensure adherence to traditional function syntax and avoid modern JavaScript functionalities.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ownership:** Assign a dedicated owner or team responsible for the ongoing monitoring and maintenance of the extension.
- **Testing Guidelines:** Regularly test the extension upon any changes to the website structure, particularly the path and sections involved. Establish automated tests where practical.
- **Performance Monitoring:** Keep tabs on performance metrics related to user interactions tied to the fired events, ensuring that all expected data points are consistently captured.
