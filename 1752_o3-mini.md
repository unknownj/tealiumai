## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** CWR triggerView Proof of Concept
- **ID:** 1752  
  *(Note: The configuration also displays an "extensionId" of 100036; ensure consistency with your internal references.)*
- **Type:** Javascript Code
- **Scope:** Pre Loader
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Once

### Summary

This extension is designed to conditionally trigger UI events on specific pages by utilising a global object method when certain DOM elements become available. Specifically, it checks if the current page's pathname starts with "/personal/cwa/cwr-hub/". If it does, it employs the method `fireWhenElementAvailable` from the global `LBGAnalytics.target` object to fire two distinct events. This mechanism allows delayed actions (e.g. view tracking or UI adjustments) to be performed only when the corresponding DOM elements are rendered on the page.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables and Global Dependencies

- **window.location.pathname:** The code uses this property to determine the current page URL. It checks if the URL starts with "/personal/cwa/cwr-hub/".
- **LBGAnalytics.target:** A global object on which the `fireWhenElementAvailable` method is expected to be defined. This method is used to asynchronously detect the availability of specific DOM elements.
- **fireWhenElementAvailable:** A method assumed to reside on the `LBGAnalytics.target` object that takes a CSS selector and an event identifier. It likely registers a callback to fire an event once the specified DOM element becomes available.

### Logic Flow

1. **Pathname Verification:**  
   The extension begins by checking if `window.location.pathname.indexOf("/personal/cwa/cwr-hub/") === 0` – ensuring that the code only executes on pages whose URL begins with a specific string.

2. **Dependency Checks:**  
   It verifies that `LBGAnalytics.target` exists and that the method `fireWhenElementAvailable` is available.  
   - This check prevents errors on pages where `LBGAnalytics.target` is undefined.

3. **Event Triggers:**  
   If the above conditions are met:
   - It calls `LBGAnalytics.target.fireWhenElementAvailable("section.borrowing-options-section", "optionsVisible");`  
     This sets up a listener for the element with the CSS selector `section.borrowing-options-section` and, upon its availability, fires the event "optionsVisible".
   - It then calls `LBGAnalytics.target.fireWhenElementAvailable("section.explore-borrowing-options", "optionsHidden");`  
     This similarly waits for the element `section.explore-borrowing-options` before firing the event "optionsHidden".

### Data Processing

- **Input Data:**  
  The only input data is derived from `window.location.pathname` which determines whether the extension should execute.
  
- **Output/Events:**  
  The data flow involves waiting for specified DOM elements and then triggering named events. There are no returned values or modifications to the page state beyond triggering these events.

- **Dependencies:**  
  The extension depends on:
  - The global `window` object for location information.
  - The existence and proper functionality of `LBGAnalytics` and its `target` object.
  - The DOM elements must eventually become available to trigger the corresponding events.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Example Scenario 1: Normal Operation

- **Page URL:** https://www.example.com/personal/cwa/cwr-hub/dashboard  
- **Behaviour:**  
  - The pathname starts with "/personal/cwa/cwr-hub/".  
  - Both DOM elements (`section.borrowing-options-section` and `section.explore-borrowing-options`) are present or will be available shortly.  
  - The extension triggers "optionsVisible" when the first element is detected and "optionsHidden" for the second element.
  
### Example Scenario 2: Element Delay

- **Condition:** The DOM elements are loaded asynchronously and are not immediately available when the script runs.  
- **Behaviour:**  
  - The extension registers the events with `LBGAnalytics.target.fireWhenElementAvailable`.
  - As soon as each element is rendered, the corresponding event ("optionsVisible" or "optionsHidden") is fired.
  
### Example Scenario 3: Missing Global Dependency

- **Condition:** The global object `LBGAnalytics` or its `target` property is not available (e.g. due to an error in loading external scripts).
- **Behaviour:**  
  - The initial condition fails (i.e. the check `LBGAnalytics.target && LBGAnalytics.target.fireWhenElementAvailable` yields false).
  - No attempts are made to call `fireWhenElementAvailable`, ensuring that the extension fails gracefully without throwing runtime errors.

### Example Scenario 4: Out of Scope URL

- **Page URL:** https://www.example.com/home  
- **Behaviour:**  
  - Since the pathname does not start with "/personal/cwa/cwr-hub/", the extension will not execute any of its logic. No events are registered or fired.

---

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Global Dependency Issue:**  
  - The code depends on the global `LBGAnalytics.target` object being present. If the external library that provides this object fails to load or is delayed, the extension will not trigger the events.
  
- **DOM Element Timing:**  
  - The extension assumes that the `fireWhenElementAvailable` method handles asynchronous DOM loading appropriately. If there is an error or delay beyond what is expected by that method, the events may not fire as intended.
  
- **Conflicts with Other Extensions:**  
  - If other Tealium extensions or external scripts modify the same global objects or DOM elements’ availability behaviour, unexpected interactions may occur.
  
- **Hard-Coded Strings:**  
  - The URL path ("/personal/cwa/cwr-hub/") and CSS selectors used in the code are hard-coded. Changes in URL structure or page markup can break the extension's functionality.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks:**  
  - Although the code already checks for the presence of `LBGAnalytics.target` and its method, you may want to add logging (using console logs, for example) to capture debugging information when the expected conditions are not met.
  
- **Code Style and Modularisation:**  
  - Consider encapsulating the functionality in a function to improve readability and enable future reuse.  
  - Separate the validation of conditions (like URL matching and dependency presence) into smaller helper functions.
  
- **Configuration Externalisation:**  
  - Externalise hard-coded values (such as URL paths and CSS selectors) into configuration variables. This makes the code easier to maintain in case of future changes.
  
- **Error Handling:**  
  - Implement error handling in the `fireWhenElementAvailable` calls to manage cases where the method fails to trigger the events.  
  - As emphasised in the refactoring guidelines, the defensive coding for `eventType` and `eventPayload` is unnecessary, but consider robust error logging for other potential issues.
  
- **Maintain ES5 Standards:**  
  - Ensure that any refactoring continues to use ES5 syntax. Avoid ES2015/ES6 features such as arrow functions, template literals, and the use of let/const in favour of var.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Testing:**  
  - Develop unit tests or integration tests that simulate the page conditions (matching and non-matching paths, delayed element availability, missing globals) to ensure the extension continues to behave as expected after any changes.
  
- **Ownership:**  
  - Assign a team or individual responsible for monitoring changes to the URL structures and associated external libraries (e.g. the one providing `LBGAnalytics.target`) to maintain compatibility.
  
- **Documentation Updates:**  
  - Keep this documentation in sync with any code changes. Ensure that any refactoring or changes in the external dependency’s behaviour are noted.
  
- **Logging and Monitoring:**  
  - Consider implementing logging mechanisms to record when events are triggered. This can assist in troubleshooting issues related to delayed or missing events.
  
- **Code Reviews:**  
  - Before merging any changes to this extension, ensure that a thorough code review is performed to validate that all dependencies and hard-coded values still conform to the intended page architecture.

This documentation should serve as a guide for developers and stakeholders in understanding, maintaining, and further developing the "CWR triggerView Proof of Concept" extension. Adjustments should be made as new requirements or changes to the architecture occur.
