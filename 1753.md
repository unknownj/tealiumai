# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name**: set order_id for dedup
- **ID**: 100003
- **Type**: Set Data Values
- **Scope**: After Load Rules
- **Execution Frequency**: Run Always

**Summary**:  
The "set order_id for dedup" extension is designed to manage and deduplicate order identifiers by setting a specific property (`s.prop18`) based on the state of a global logging object (`window.fphdLog`). This is essential for ensuring that each order is uniquely identified in tracking scenarios, thereby preventing duplication of events.

---

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- **s.prop18**: A string that will hold the deduplicated order identifiers.
- **window.fphdLog**: A global object that stores logs related to order data. Its keys are assumed to represent order IDs, and the values are booleans indicating presence or validity.

### Logic Flow
1. Immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) captures `eventType` and `eventPayload`.
2. Inside the IIFE:
   - It checks whether `window.fphdLog` exists.
   - If it does, `s.prop18` is populated by filtering the keys of `window.fphdLog`.
   - Only keys with a truthy value are retained.
   - The resulting keys are sorted and joined into a single string, which is assigned to `s.prop18`.

### Dependencies
The code relies on the presence of the global object `window.fphdLog`, which must be defined before this extension runs, as well as the variable `s`, which appears to belong to the broader tracking framework of Tealium.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Scenario
When the global logging object `window.fphdLog` contains the following keys:

```javascript
window.fphdLog = {
    'order1': true,
    'order2': false,
    'order3': true
};
```
After executing the extension, `s.prop18` would be set to:

```
order1order3
```
This indicates that only valid orders are included for tracking.

### Edge Conditions
- **No Valid Orders**: If `window.fphdLog` is empty or all values are falsy, `s.prop18` would be set to an empty string.
- **Undefined `window.fphdLog`**: If `window.fphdLog` is not defined, the function will bypass the assignment, leaving `s.prop18` unchanged.

---

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Performance**: If `window.fphdLog` contains a large number of entries, the sorting operation could impact performance.
- **Dependence on Global State**: The extension's functionality is heavily reliant on `window.fphdLog`; if it is redefined or modified elsewhere in the code without warning, it can lead to unexpected results.
- **Conflicts**: If other extensions or scripts manipulate `window.fphdLog`, it may interfere with this extension's functionality, potentially leading to incorrect order IDs being assigned.

---

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks**: While no defensive checks are required for `eventType` or `eventPayload`, adding a check to ensure `window.fphdLog` is indeed an object could prevent runtime errors.
- **Code Modularity**: Consider breaking down the logic into smaller functions to enhance readability and maintainability, should the complexity increase in the future.
- **Clear Variable Naming**: Ensure that variable names, such as `s.prop18`, are described adequately in comments for future maintainers, clarifying their role in deduplication.

Example refactoring could involve:

```javascript
function processLogs(logs) {
    return Object.keys(logs).filter(function(key) {
        return logs[key];
    }).sort().join("");
}

if (typeof window.fphdLog === 'object') {
    s.prop18 = processLogs(window.fphdLog);
}
```

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ownership**: Assign ownership of the extension to a specific developer or team responsible for monitoring and updating it as necessary.
- **Testing Guidelines**: Always conduct thorough testing in a controlled environment after any changes, particularly related to the handling of global objects.
- **Documentation Updates**: Keep this documentation up-to-date with any future changes to the extension's logic or its dependencies to ensure its ongoing clarity and utility.
