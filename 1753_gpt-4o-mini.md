# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: Analytics FPHD Integration

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name**: Analytics FPHD Integration
- **ID**: 1753
- **Type**: Javascript Code
- **Scope**: After Load Rules
- **Execution Frequency**: Run Always

### Summary
The Analytics FPHD Integration extension is designed to capture and process user interaction logs from the `window.fphdLog` global object. The purpose of this extension is to collate relevant event data based on predefined keys and update the `s.prop18` variable with a string representation of the active interactions. This is particularly useful for analytics tracking when integrating with frameworks that require this data to be stored or sent to a server.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- `window.fphdLog`: A global JavaScript object expected to hold logs of user interactions.
- `s.prop18`: A variable that will be updated with a string of interaction keys joined together.

### Logic Flow
1. The code begins by checking if `window.fphdLog` exists, ensuring that the subsequent operations can proceed without raising an error.
2. If `window.fphdLog` is present, it filters the keys of the object to include only those with truthy values (indicating active interactions).
3. The truthy keys are then sorted alphabetically and concatenated into a string which will be stored in `s.prop18`.

### Dependencies
- **Global Objects**: The extension assumes the existence of `window.fphdLog`. If this object is not present, the extension will not perform any operations.
- **Tealium Variables**: The extension relies on the `s` object, which is a standard in Tealium's analytics framework.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Operation
- **Scenario**: User interacts with elements that log actions into `window.fphdLog`.
- **Flow**:
  - A key-value pair is added to `window.fphdLog`, such as `{ 'clickButton': true }`.
  - When the extension runs, it will populate `s.prop18` with the string "clickButton".

### Edge Conditions
- **Scenario**: `window.fphdLog` is an empty object.
- **Flow**:
  - The extension checks for `window.fphdLog`, finds it, but since no keys are truthy, `s.prop18` will be set to an empty string.
  
- **Scenario**: `window.fphdLog` contains keys with falsy values.
- **Flow**:
  - Example `window.fphdLog`: `{ 'clickButton': false, 'hoverElement': undefined }`.
  - As a result, `s.prop18` would also end up as an empty string due to no truthy keys.

---

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- The extension does not handle cases where `window.fphdLog` is not defined. If this occurs, the extension simply performs no operations.
- Since `s.prop18` is directly overwritten each time the extension runs, previous values will be lost. This may lead to unintended overwriting if multiple interactions occur in quick succession.
- If other Tealium extensions manipulate `s.prop18` after this extension runs, it may lead to conflicts in data representation, causing data integrity issues.

---

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks**: Although eventType and eventPayload are guaranteed, it could be beneficial to implement checks on `window.fphdLog` to ensure it is an object before processing.
  
- **Code Style**: Maintaining consistent spacing and indentation will improve readability for other developers. 

- **Modularization**: Consider isolating the filter and string generation logic into its own function for easier testing and potential reusability.

```javascript
function getActiveFphdKeys(fphdLog) {
    return Object.keys(fphdLog).filter(function(a) { return fphdLog[a]; }).sort().join('');
}

(function(a, b) {
    if (window.fphdLog) {
        s.prop18 = getActiveFphdKeys(window.fphdLog);
    }
})(eventType, eventPayload);
```

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ownership**: Assign a lead developer for ongoing maintenance, ideally someone familiar with the user interactions tracked by `window.fphdLog`.
- **Testing Guidelines**: Conduct testing scenarios to validate that `s.prop18` correctly reflects the intended interactions when `window.fphdLog` is manipulated. Test both populated and empty cases to ensure expected outcomes.
- **Documentation**: Keep this document updated with any enhancements or changes to the extension logic or expected behaviour, including versioning details for future reference.
