# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: Pegasus Tag Abort Rules

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name**: Pegasus tag abort rules
- **ID**: 1756
- **Type**: JavaScript Code
- **Scope**: 1521
- **Execution Frequency**: On page load event

### Summary
The Pegasus Tag Abort Rules extension is designed to manage the firing of Pegasus-related tags based on specific conditions related to user journeys and application states. It implements rules that determine whether to proceed with tag execution or to abort it, making sure that certain criteria are met before allowing these tags to fire. This prevents unnecessary tag executions and ensures data quality by only allowing relevant tags to be triggered.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- **`flg`**: Represents the abort flag state with three possible values: `"Y"` (abort), `"N"` (do not abort), or `""` (blank).
- **`b`**: Represents the `eventPayload`, containing key data such as `Brand`, `JourneyName`, `ApplicationState`, `JourneyStepName`, and `JourneyStep`.
- **`sessionStorage`**: Used to track whether a Pegasus tag has already been sent during the current session. 

### Logic Flow
1. **Initial Reset**: On page load, the abort flag is reset to an empty state (`""`) to clear any persisted values from previous interactions.
2. **Condition Checks**: The code checks whether the current brand belongs to certain specified brands (Lloyds, Halifax, etc.), before moving on to further checks.
3. **Journey Name and State Evaluation**: The extension evaluates the `JourneyName`, `ApplicationState`, and `JourneyStep` to apply specific business rules:
   - Each journey has tailored rules that determine if the provided inputs meet predefined conditions to abort execution.
4. **Abort Flag Set**: If any condition fails, the abort flag is set to `"Y"`, and the execution is halted.
5. **Session Storage Check**: Before firing the tag, it checks session storage to prevent duplicates. If a matching tag is found in the storage log, it also sets the abort flag to `"Y"`.

### Dependencies
- **`utag.data`**: Standard global variable used to store and retrieve Tealium's data layer values.
- **`clova3.datalayer.set`**: Method for setting values in a specified data layer, which appears to be specific to a certain implementation or brand.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Conditions
- **Scenario**: A user begins an application journey for a savings product.
   - **Input**: JourneyName = "applysavings", ApplicationState = "application", JourneyStepName = "about you".
   - **Behavior**: The tag will execute since the `JourneyStepName` meets the conditions specified.

### Edge Conditions
- **Scenario**: A user navigates back to a previous step in an application journey unexpectedly.
   - **Input**: JourneyName = "applyloan", ApplicationState = "application", JourneyStep = 2, JourneyStepName = "loans calculator".
   - **Behavior**: The execution will be aborted because the step does not match the expected sequence, setting `pegasusAbortFlg` to "Y".

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Session Storage Constraints**: Reliance on `sessionStorage` means that the behavior is limited to a single session. Page refreshes or navigating away will reset the flags.
- **Compatibility**: Certain browsers that do not support `sessionStorage` may run into issues, although most modern browsers should support it.
- **Conflict with Other Extensions**: There could be conflicts if other extensions attempt to manipulate the same data layer values or if they execute before this extension, leading to inconsistent data.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks**: Ensure more robust checks for the presence of properties on the `b` object to avoid potential `undefined` errors. 
- **Modularization**: Consider breaking down the logic into smaller functions or modules for readability and maintainability.
- **Code Style**: Maintain consistent indentation and spacing for better readability. Encapsulate repeated logic in functions to reduce code duplication and improve clarity.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ownership**: Assign a dedicated owner or team responsible for maintaining this extension, especially as business rules may evolve over time.
- **Testing Guidelines**: Regularly test the extension against various user journeys, particularly those identified as edge cases, to ensure ongoing functionality.
- **Documentation Updates**: Update this documentation whenever changes are made to the extension to ensure it reflects the current implementation accurately.
