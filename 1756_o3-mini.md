# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: Pegasus Tag Abort Rules

This document provides a comprehensive overview, code explanation, usage examples, known limitations, recommendations for refactoring, and maintenance notes for the Pegasus Tag Abort Rules extension.

---

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name**: Pegasus tag abort rules  
- **ID**: 1756 (Extension ID: 100036)  
- **Type**: Javascript Code  
- **Scope**: 1521  
- **Execution Frequency**: Runs on every page load where the conditions and data layer meet the defined criteria

**Summary**:  
This extension is designed to control the firing of Pegasus-related tags by establishing rules that can abort tag execution. It does this by setting an abort flag (`pegasusAbortFlg`) based on certain conditions extracted from the data layer (object `b`) — such as the brand name, journey name, application state, journey step, or journey step name. In addition, the extension utilises sessionStorage to ensure that a Pegasus tag is only fired once per session. The abort flag is updated across multiple objects/libraries to ensure consistency.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables & Functions

- **Global Parameters**:  
  - `a` corresponds to the event type (`eventType`).
  - `b` corresponds to the event payload/data layer (`eventPayload`).
  - `u` corresponds to the tag object (`tagObject`).

- **setAbort(flg)**:  
  This helper function sets the abort flag for Pegasus based on the following:
  - Sets `pegasusAbortFlg` in the local object `b`
  - Updates `utag.data.pegasusAbortFlg` to synchronise with Tealium’s data layer
  - Uses the third-party library (`clova3.datalayer`) to persist the abort flag, where available.

### Logic Flow

1. **Initial Check for Descope**:  
   The extension begins by checking if the brand (using `b["Brand"]`) matches one of the documented brands (LLOYDS, HALIFAX, BOS, MBNA). If it does not match, none of the following rules are applied.

2. **Resetting the Abort Flag**:  
   Before performing additional checks, the abort flag is reset to an empty string to avoid any persistence issues from previous page loads.

3. **Journey and Application Checks**:  
   The extension then checks for the existence of required keys in the data layer: `JourneyName`, `ApplicationState`, `JourneyStepName`, and `JourneyStep`.  
   - For each supported journey (e.g. `applyccc`, `applyloanntf`, `applyloanntfec`, `applyloan`, `applysavings`, `applypca`, `new purchase scenario`, `standardb2c`, `applycarfinance`, `travelmoneyorder`, `mortgagesaip`, `mortgagefinder`, `retail new ra application`), there are specific conditions under which the tag should be aborted.  
   - For example, in the `applyccc` journey, if the `ApplicationState` is `application` and the `JourneyStep` is not `1`, or the `JourneyStepName` does not match one of the allowed values (such as "personaldetails" or "eligibilitydetails"), then the abort flag is set to "Y" and execution stops (`return false`).

4. **Session Storage Handling**:  
   - For sessions where the abort flag has not been set (i.e. is empty or non-existent), the code then checks sessionStorage for a key called `pegasusLog`.  
   - If a log exists and contains the current Pegasus tag name (from `b["PegasusTagName"]`), the abort flag is updated to "Y" to prevent double-firing of the tag.
   - If the tag name is not present in the session cache, the tag name is added to the cache and the abort flag is set to "N".  
   - If the session storage entry does not exist, it is created with the current Pegasus tag name and the abort flag is set to "N".

### Dependencies

- **Global Data Layer Objects**:  
  - `b` (eventPayload) is expected to include keys such as `Brand`, `JourneyName`, `ApplicationState`, `JourneyStepName`, `JourneyStep`, and `PegasusTagName`.
  - `utag.data` is used to set the global abort flag.
  - A global library object `clova3.datalayer` is used to synchronise the abort flag.
  
- **Browser API**:  
  - The Javascript `sessionStorage` object is utilised to ensure a tag only fires once per session.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Standard Processing for an Allowed Journey

- **Data Layer Example**:
  - Brand: "Lloyds"
  - JourneyName: "applyccc"
  - ApplicationState: "application"
  - JourneyStep: 1
  - JourneyStepName: "personaldetails"
  - PegasusTagName: "pegasusTag1"

- **Behaviour**:
  1. The brand passes the regex test.
  2. Required fields (`JourneyName`, `ApplicationState`, `JourneyStepName`, `JourneyStep`) exist.
  3. Since the journey is `applyccc` and the step and step name meet the allowed criteria, the abort flag remains blank until reaching the sessionStorage check.
  4. In sessionStorage, if `pegasusTag1` is not logged, it is added, and the flag is ultimately set to "N", allowing the Pegasus tag to fire.

### Scenario 2: Abort Conditions Triggered from Journey Checks

- **Data Layer Example**:
  - Brand: "HALIFAX"
  - JourneyName: "applyloanntf"
  - ApplicationState: "application"
  - JourneyStep: 1 (incorrect step; should be 2)
  
- **Behaviour**:
  1. The brand passes the regex test.
  2. All required keys exist.
  3. For journey `applyloanntf`, the condition `(b["JourneyStep"] != 2)` is met, triggering `setAbort("Y")` and returning `false`.
  4. The tag is aborted and will not fire.

### Scenario 3: Session Storage Preventing Duplicate Tag Execution

- **Data Layer Example**:
  - Brand: "MBNA"
  - JourneyName: "applysavings"
  - ApplicationState: "application"
  - JourneyStepName: "about you" (allowed condition)
  - PegasusTagName: "pegasusTag2"

- **Behaviour**:
  1. The conditions are met, and the steps pass the initial checks.
  2. When the code checks sessionStorage and finds that `pegasusTag2` already exists from a previous execution in the session, it sets the abort flag to "Y", thus preventing the tag from firing a second time.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Strict Data Layer Dependence**:  
  The extension heavily relies on the presence and correct spelling/capitalisation of keys in the data layer. Any discrepancy in naming (e.g. `JourneyStepName` vs. `journeystepname`) can lead to unintended behaviour.

- **Session Storage Reliance**:  
  If the browser does not support `sessionStorage` or if it is cleared during the session, duplicate tag firing prevention may fail.

- **Multiple Conditional Checks**:  
  A deep nesting of conditionals may make debugging and maintenance challenging. Any unexpected value (e.g. null, undefined, or incorrect type) in one of the keys (e.g. `JourneyStep`) might bypass certain checks or lead to unexpected abort flag settings.

- **Potential Conflicts**:  
  - Extensions that modify or rely on the same data layer keys (e.g. `pegasusAbortFlg`, `PegasusTagName`) may conflict.
  - Third-party libraries like `clova3.datalayer` might not be available in all environments or could behave unexpectedly in different integration scenarios.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Code Modularity**:  
  Consider isolating the journey-specific logic into separate functions. This would improve readability and maintenance. For example, separate functions for handling `applyccc`, `applyloanntf`, etc.

- **Reduce Deep Nesting**:  
  Flatten nested conditionals where possible. For instance, use early returns if a check does not meet criteria. This makes the code easier to follow.

- **Defensive Checks**:  
  Although defensive coding for `eventType` or `eventPayload` is not required, consider adding comments or slight error checks for other data layer keys that are critical for decision making.

- **Code Style Consistency**:  
  Ensure consistent use of indentation and spacing for enhanced readability.  
  Given the ES5 support requirements, avoid ES6+ practices. Ensure the use of function expressions and traditional var declarations, which is already being adhered to.

- **Comment Enhancements**:  
  The current comments are helpful but could be enhanced with further explanations when multiple nested conditions are present. Clear inline comments for each journey’s condition block would assist in maintenance.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance**:  
  - Regularly review the conditions against evolving business rules and journey definitions.
  - Monitor the usage of global variables and third-party library methods (like `clova3.datalayer`) for any deprecations or changes in API behaviour.

- **Ownership**:  
  Assign a dedicated developer or team for monitoring the extension's performance and making necessary adjustments as business rules change. Maintain a changelog for modifications.

- **Testing Guidelines**:
  - Create unit tests for each journey condition to ensure that the abort flag is correctly set based on the input data.
  - Simulate scenarios with missing or malformed data to validate that the extension fails gracefully.
  - Perform cross-browser testing to verify the correct behaviour of `sessionStorage` usage.

- **Documentation Updates**:  
  Update this documentation in tandem with any code changes. Include version numbers and change logs to ensure transparency with all stakeholders.
