## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Calculate interest income for floodlight  
- **ID:** 1757 (Extension) | 100036 (Configured Extension Metadata)  
- **Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** After Load Rules  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Always  

### Summary
This extension calculates the interest income (often interpreted as the profit from interest over the term of a loan) based on a set of input values provided via Tealium's data layer. Specifically, it:
- Checks for the existence of key parameters: JourneyAmount (loan amount), JourneyRate (interest rate), and JourneyTerm (loan term).
- Calculates monthly payments and the overall interest income for the duration of the loan.
- Stores the computed income in multiple locations (utag.data, clova3.datalayer, and the event payload object) to ensure broad accessibility for subsequent tags or extensions.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables and Objects

- **eventType & eventPayload (alias a, b):**  
  These are the default objects passed to the extension, representing the event type (string) and the associated event payload (object). The payload (`b`) is used to store and validate input and output data.

- **JourneyAmount:**  
  Represents the loan amount. It is retrieved from `b["JourneyAmount"]` and, if defined, parsed as an integer.

- **JourneyRate:**  
  Represents the annual interest rate. Retrieved directly from `b["JourneyRate"]`, it is then divided by 1200 to convert to a monthly rate (as a decimal).

- **JourneyTerm:**  
  Represents the duration/term of the loan in months. Parsed as an integer from `b["JourneyTerm"]`.

- **JourneyIncome:**  
  The calculated interest income. If it is not previously defined, or if its value is less than or equal to zero, or it is not a number, then the calculation is executed.

- **MonthlyPayment:**  
  Represents the monthly payment for the loan computed using the standard annuity formula.

- **Income:**  
  Represents the total interest income calculated as the total payments over the term minus the principal amount.

### Logic Flow
1. **Validation Checks:**  
   The code first ensures that all necessary input values (`JourneyAmount`, `JourneyRate`, and `JourneyTerm`) are defined. It also checks whether `JourneyIncome` has already been set and ensures it is a valid, positive number.

2. **Calculation Process:**
   - Convert `JourneyTerm` and `JourneyAmount` to integers.
   - Compute the monthly interest rate (`mi`) from `JourneyRate` by dividing by 1200.
   - Calculate the compounded base for the term using a loop. The variable `base` multiplies by `(1 + mi)` for each month.
   - Compute the monthly payment using the annuity formula:  
     MonthlyPayment = (amount * mi) / (1 - (1 / base))
   - Calculate the total interest income by subtracting the principal from the total payments over the term:  
     Income = (MonthlyPayment * term) - amount  
     The use of the bitwise NOT operator (`~~`) is employed to force the conversion of the final value to an integer.

3. **Data Assignment:**
   - The computed `Income` is then stored in `utag.data.JourneyIncome`, using `clova3.datalayer.set` for synchronous updates, and finally re-assigned into the event payload property `b["JourneyIncome"]`.

### Global Objects / Library Dependencies
- **utag.data:**  
  Part of the Tealium universal tag library, used here to persist the computed `JourneyIncome` in the global data layer.
  
- **clova3.datalayer:**  
  A custom data layer object, with its `set` method used to update `JourneyIncome` consistently across the environment.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Scenario
**Input:**  
- JourneyAmount: "100000" (e.g. £100,000 loan)  
- JourneyRate: 6 (6% annual interest)  
- JourneyTerm: "360" (30 years in months)  

**Process:**  
- The extension validates the presence of all three parameters.
- It calculates the monthly payment based on the annuity formula.
- The total interest income is computed and stored in `utag.data`, `clova3.datalayer`, and `eventPayload`.

**Output:**  
- JourneyIncome will be a positive integer representing the profit from interest, e.g. 115000 (the actual number depends on the precise calculations).

### Edge and Exceptional Conditions
- **Pre-Computed Income:**  
  If `b["JourneyIncome"]` is already defined and greater than 0, the calculation block is skipped, ensuring the extension does not override pre-existing computed values.
  
- **Missing Data:**  
  If any of the three key inputs (JourneyAmount, JourneyRate, JourneyTerm) is missing or undefined, the calculations are bypassed, and no modification is made to `JourneyIncome`.

- **Invalid Numeric Values:**  
  If `JourneyTerm` or `JourneyAmount` are not valid numeric strings (parseInt returns NaN), the calculation may produce unintended results. The current logic does not include extensive error handling for non-numeric input.

---

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Numeric Parsing:**  
  The use of parseInt without strict validation may yield NaN if the input is not a properly formatted numeric string. This could cause the calculation to fail silently.

- **Compound Loop Calculation:**  
  The loop to compute the compounded interest rate (`base`) could be optimised using `Math.pow` for clarity and efficiency; however, this change would require caution given the ES5 support requirement.

- **Global Object Dependencies:**  
  The extension relies on the presence of `utag.data` and `clova3.datalayer`. If these objects are not available or correctly defined in the environment where the extension runs, data assignment operations will fail.

- **Hardcoded Variable Names:**  
  The code directly accesses object properties from `eventPayload` (alias `b`). Any changes in the naming conventions or structure of the data layer in Tealium could lead to issues.

- **Bitwise Operator for Flooring:**  
  The use of `~~` is a known trick to convert a floating point number to an integer. However, it may not be immediately clear to all developers and can reduce code readability.

---

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks for Numeric Values:**  
  Although the inputs are expected to be valid, consider adding checks to ensure that `parseInt` does not return `NaN`. For example:
  
  • Verify that the parsed values are actual numbers before proceeding with calculations.  
  
- **Optimise the Compound Interest Calculation:**  
  Given the ES5 restriction, you could still simplify using a loop abstraction or inline calculation with `Math.pow`:
  
  • Replace the loop with:  
    var base = Math.pow(1 + mi, term);
  
  This offers both clarity and a reduction in potential errors, as long as ES5 compatibility is assured.

- **Improved Variable Naming:**  
  Use more descriptive variable names, such as `loanAmount`, `annualInterestRate`, `loanTerm`, `monthlyPayment`, and `totalInterestIncome` for better readability.

- **Modularisation:**  
  Consider extracting the calculation logic into a dedicated function. This can facilitate unit testing and simplify future modifications.

- **Comments and Documentation:**  
  Extend inline comments to explain why certain operations (like the use of `~~`) are performed, so that future maintainers understand the rationale.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Testing:**  
  • Implement unit tests covering various scenarios (valid data, missing parameters, non-numeric input, already computed income) to ensure the extension behaves as expected.  
  • Include integration tests within the Tealium environment to monitor interactions with other scripts and extensions.

- **Ownership:**  
  • Designate a responsible team or developer who is familiar with both Tealium and standard financial calculations to maintain and update this extension.

- **Change Log:**  
  • Maintain a version history in the code comments or accompanying documentation to track any modifications and the reasons behind them.

- **Collaboration:**  
  • When integrating any changes, particularly those involving refactoring the core calculation logic, review potential impacts on dependency objects such as `utag.data` and `clova3.datalayer`.

- **Documentation Updates:**  
  • Regularly review and update this documentation to reflect changes in the extension's logic, integration points, or external dependencies.
