# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: GAD : Fire on Workday Links

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name**: GAD : Fire on Workday Links
- **ID**: 1758
- **Type**: Javascript Code
- **Scope**: 1502
- **Execution Frequency**: On specific events (dependent on event type)

### Summary
This Tealium extension is designed to intercept and handle certain link events specifically related to Workday. The primary purpose of the extension is to ensure that analytics tracking is performed when an "Offsite Link" event occurs. This enables accurate tracking of user interactions with Workday links, which is essential for marketing and analytics purposes.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- **`eventType`**: A string that indicates the type of event being processed.
- **`eventPayload`**: An object that contains information about the event, which may include various properties relevant to the specific event.
- **`tagObject`**: An object representing the current tag being executed in Tealium.

### Logic Flow
The code structure follows a simple conditional check:
1. The function checks if the `EventAction` within the `eventPayload` is equal to `"Offsite Link"`.
2. If the condition is false (i.e., the event is not an "Offsite Link"), the function returns `false`, effectively stopping further processing. 
3. If the condition is true, the function will continue (though no further action is specified in the provided code).

### Dependencies
This extension does not rely on any external libraries or global objects beyond the context provided by Tealium's execution environment. It uses the `eventType`, `eventPayload`, and `tagObject` variables that are expected to be defined within the scope of the Tealium extension framework.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Conditions
- **Scenario**: A user clicks on a Workday link that qualifies as an "Offsite Link."
    - **Input**: 
      ```javascript
      var eventType = 'linkClick';
      var eventPayload = { "EventAction": "Offsite Link" };
      ```
    - **Behaviour**: The condition is met, allowing any analytics tags associated with the event to fire, facilitating tracking for Workday interactions.

### Edge Conditions
- **Scenario**: A user clicks on an internal link.
    - **Input**: 
      ```javascript
      var eventType = 'linkClick';
      var eventPayload = { "EventAction": "Internal Link" };
      ```
    - **Behaviour**: The condition is not satisfied, and the function returns `false`. No analytics firing occurs, effectively ignoring the internal link click.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Limited Scope**: The extension only processes events flagged as "Offsite Link". Any external link interaction not labelled as such will be ignored.
- **No Feedback Mechanism**: There is no notification or logging to inform of the condition failure when an event does not meet the criteria, which may make debugging difficult in case of unexpected behaviour.
- **Conflicts with Other Extensions**: If other extensions modify the `eventPayload` or `EventAction`, there is potential for conflict, particularly if they alter these properties before this extension is executed.

---

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Enhance Logging**: Implement a logging mechanism to capture when an event does not meet the conditions. This will aid in debugging and provide visibility into event handling.
- **Modular Code Structure**: Consider structuring the code into separate functions for clarity. For example, a dedicated function for checking event conditions may help improve readability and maintainability.
- **Add Comments**: While the code is relatively straightforward, adding comments to explain the intention behind checks and actions can improve understandability for future developers.
- **Future-Proofing**: If required, consider allowing for additional parameters or configurations to handle various types of links without hardcoding the "Offsite Link" action.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance**: This extension should be reviewed periodically for relevance, especially as business and tracking needs change. Ensure that it aligns with broader analytics strategies.
- **Ownership**: Assign a dedicated owner from the analytics or development team to oversee modifications and address any issues that arise.
- **Testing Guidelines**: It is recommended to conduct testing in different scenarios to validate the extension's behaviour, particularly focusing on link clicks across various eventActions. Automated testing could be implemented if the infrastructure allows.

This thorough documentation aims to serve as a clear reference for developers and stakeholders involved in the management and enhancement of this Tealium extension.
