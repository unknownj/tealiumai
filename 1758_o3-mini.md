# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: GAD : Fire on workday links

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** GAD : Fire on workday links  
- **ID:** 1758  
- **Extension ID:** 100036  
- **Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** 1502  
- **Execution Frequency:** Runs on every applicable event; however, only continues processing if the event payload meets certain criteria

**Summary:**  
This extension is designed to check for user interactions with links that potentially indicate "offsite" activity. Specifically, it inspects an event's payload and only allows further logic execution if the "EventAction" property is exactly "Offsite Link". This functionality ensures that any related code (potentially for triggering advertising or tracking pixels) only fires in response to workday links. Although the extension is named within a Google Ads (GAD) context, its current implementation only demonstrates the conditional check.

---

## 2. Code Explanation

The code is self-contained within an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) that accepts three parameters. Here is a breakdown of its components:

- **Parameters:**  
  - `a` (corresponding to `eventType`): Represents the type of event.  
  - `b` (corresponding to `eventPayload`): An object containing event data.  
  - `u` (corresponding to `tagObject`): A tag or configuration object provided by Tealium.

- **Key Variable:**  
  - `b["EventAction"]`: The property within the event payload that is checked against the string "Offsite Link".

- **Logic Flow:**  
  1. The function is immediately executed with the arguments `eventType`, `eventPayload`, and `tagObject`.  
  2. It performs a single conditional check:  
     - If `b["EventAction"]` is not equal to "Offsite Link", the function returns `false`.
  3. If `b["EventAction"]` equals "Offsite Link", the function does not explicitly return a value (thus implicitly returning `undefined`).  
     - The expectation is that additional code may follow the conditional check to handle the desired "fire" logic. Currently, that logic is absent.

- **Dependencies:**  
  - This extension depends on Tealium providing the following global objects/variables:  
    - `eventType` (as a string)  
    - `eventPayload` (as an object)  
    - `tagObject` (as an object)  
  - These must be defined and passed in by the Tealium platform.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Scenario

- **Event Data:**  
  - `eventType`: "click"  
  - `eventPayload`: { "EventAction": "Offsite Link", ... }  
  - `tagObject`: { ... }

- **Execution:**  
  - The IIFE is executed.  
  - The condition `b["EventAction"] != "Offsite Link"` evaluates to `false` (since it is equal), so the conditional block does not execute a `return false`.  
  - The function runs to its end (implicitly returning `undefined`), potentially allowing subsequent code (if added) to fire the Google Ads-related actions.

### Edge Scenario

- **Event Data:**  
  - `eventType`: "click"  
  - `eventPayload`: { "EventAction": "Internal Link", ... }  
  - `tagObject`: { ... }

- **Execution:**  
  - As the function is executed, the condition `b["EventAction"] != "Offsite Link"` evaluates to `true`.  
  - The function returns `false` immediately, effectively short-circuiting any additional processing.  
  - This prevents any "offsite link" handling code from being executed for internal links.

---

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Incomplete Functionality:**  
  - The extension currently only includes a condition check. There is no additional logic beyond the check, so the "fire" functionality is not fully implemented within this snippet.
  
- **Implicit Behaviour:**  
  - When `b["EventAction"]` equals "Offsite Link", the absence of an explicit return or additional operations implies that further processing may be expected. This may lead to confusion if developers assume other actions occur.

- **External Dependencies:**  
  - The extension implicitly relies on the accurate definition and format of `eventType`, `eventPayload`, and `tagObject` as provided by Tealium. Any discrepancies in these objects may lead to unintended behaviour.

- **Potential Conflicts:**  
  - If there are other Tealium extensions or external scripts that also modify or rely on the `eventPayload` structure or the "EventAction" property, conflicts might occur.
  
- **No Error Handling:**  
  - The extension lacks any error handling; if the expected properties are missing or have unexpected types, the extension may not behave as intended.

---

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks:**  
  - Although eventType and eventPayload are guaranteed to be present, it is still good practice to check that `b["EventAction"]` exists and is of the correct type.  
    Example (ES5 compliant):  
    // if (typeof b["EventAction"] === "undefined") {  
    //     return false;  
    // }

- **Code Style and Readability:**  
  - Add comments within the code to explain each step and the purpose of the condition.
  - Consider naming the parameters more descriptively (e.g. "eventType", "eventPayload", "tagObject") within the function’s scope for improved clarity.

- **Modularisation:**  
  - As further functionality is added (e.g., firing additional tracking or advertising pixels), consider refactoring the code into smaller helper functions to encapsulate discrete logic.

- **Explicit Returns:**  
  - When more code is added, explicitly handle both the successful and unsuccessful conditions through explicit return statements or branching logic to improve readability.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  - Regularly review the extension when Tealium’s platform updates to ensure compatibility with any changes to the event timing or payload structures.
  - Document any new features added to the extension in both code comments and the documentation page.

- **Ownership:**  
  - Clearly define who is responsible for the upkeep of this extension. Designate a team member or group to review it periodically.

- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Create unit tests or use a staging environment to test all variations of `eventPayload` values, ensuring that only events with "Offsite Link" as the `EventAction` trigger subsequent actions.
  - Test for potential conflicts with other extensions by examining the order of execution and shared data structures.

- **Further Documentation:**  
  - As the extension evolves, update this documentation to include any new parameters, configuration options, or dependencies.
  - Consider adding a version history section to track changes over time.
