# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: Abort Send for Duplicated Data

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the "Abort Send for Duplicated Data" extension, detailing its functionality, code logic, usage scenarios, known limitations, and recommendations for future improvements. It is intended to aid developers and stakeholders in understanding, maintaining, and possibly enhancing this Tealium iQ extension.

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Abort Send for Duplicated Data  
- **ID:** 1760  
- **Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** 928  
- **Execution Frequency:** Invoked every time the extension is triggered by the associated event within the Tealium iQ tag load process

**Summary:**  
This extension is designed to prevent duplicate or unnecessary data transmissions. It checks for specific conditions based on the event payload and the current page context (as derived from the URL) and aborts data sending if the information appears to be duplicate or incomplete. Its primary purpose is to reduce redundant analytics and tracking events that could skew reporting or overload the data layer.

---

## 2. Code Explanation

The extension code is encapsulated in an immediately invoked function with three parameters:
- **a** – Corresponds to the event type (for example, a string indicating the type of event).  
- **b** – Represents the event payload (an object containing various data fields).  
- **u** – Refers to the tag object.

### Key Logical Checks and Flow:

1. **ForceSend Check:**
   - The first conditional statement checks for a property `ForceSend` on the event payload (`b`).  
   - If `b.ForceSend` evaluates to true, the code immediately returns `true`, meaning that the data should be sent regardless of further conditions.

2. **Conditional Checks for Specific URL Segments (cwa):**
   - The script checks if the current page's pathname (using `window.location.pathname`) contains the substring `"cwa"`.  
   - If so, it further checks whether the payload lacks any of the following properties: `JourneyName`, `JourneyStepName`, and `JourneyAction`.  
   - If all three are missing, the function returns `false`, thereby aborting the send to avoid sending incomplete data on pages likely designated for specific customer web applications.

3. **Handling the "maketransaction" Journey:**
   - If `JourneyName` exists and its value (converted to lowercase) equals `"maketransaction"`, the function further inspects the `EventNarrative` property.  
   - It converts `EventNarrative` to lowercase and then checks multiple conditions:
     - If `EventNarrative` starts with "base input id" or "select account or recipient".
     - If `EventNarrative` exactly equals one of several key values (e.g., "continue", "change beneficiary", "select beneficiary", "payment amount", "reference-field", "amount-field", "txt-account-name", "back to your accounts").
   - If any of these conditions are met, the function returns `false`, aborting data send for these duplicate or low-value events.

4. **Handling the "Logon Second Factor" Journey:**
   - If `JourneyName` is exactly `"Logon Second Factor"`, the code constructs a `currentStep` identifier.  
   - It does this by creating an array of four properties: `JourneyName`, `JourneyProduct`, `JourneyStepName`, and `JourneyAction`.  
   - Each element is set to its corresponding value from the payload (`b`) or uses the property name as a fallback.
   - The array is then joined into a string with "!" as a separator.
   - The global variable `window.lsfCurrentStep` is then compared with this `currentStep`:
     - If they are identical, it returns `false` (preventing duplicate sends for the same step).
     - Otherwise, it updates `window.lsfCurrentStep` with the new `currentStep` value to track the latest state.

### Dependencies on Global Objects/Libraries:
- **window.location:** Used to inspect the current page's pathname.
- **window.lsfCurrentStep:** A global variable utilised to track the last processed step for "Logon Second Factor" events.
- **Global variables `eventType`, `eventPayload`, and `tagObject`:** These are passed into the function and represent the event context provided by Tealium iQ.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Example 1: Force Sending Data
- **Input:**  
  Event payload (`b`) contains `ForceSend` set to true.
- **Behaviour:**  
  Regardless of other conditions, the extension returns `true` immediately, allowing the data to be sent.
- **Scenario:**  
  A special case where an override is required, such as during testing or critical event capture.

### Example 2: Incomplete "cwa" Page Event
- **Input:**  
  The URL pathname includes `"cwa"` and the payload lacks `JourneyName`, `JourneyStepName`, and `JourneyAction`.
- **Behaviour:**  
  The function returns `false`, aborting the send to avoid processing incomplete journey information.
- **Scenario:**  
  A user navigating a customer web application page that hasn’t yet collected all journey data.

### Example 3: Processing "maketransaction" Events
- **Input:**  
  - `JourneyName` is set to `"maketransaction"`.
  - `EventNarrative` is provided as `"Base Input ID...."` (or any narrative starting with an undesired prefix).
- **Behaviour:**  
  The narrative is converted to lowercase, the undesired prefix is detected, and the function returns `false` to suppress duplicate or non-valuable events.
- **Scenario:**  
  When the user interacts with form elements or actions where certain narratives (like "continue" or "payment amount") would lead to duplicate tracking.

### Example 4: "Logon Second Factor" Duplicate Prevention
- **Input:**  
  - `JourneyName` is `"Logon Second Factor"`.
  - The payload includes values for `JourneyProduct`, `JourneyStepName`, and `JourneyAction`.
- **Behaviour:**  
  A `currentStep` string is generated.  
  - If `window.lsfCurrentStep` already matches the generated string, the function returns `false`, aborting a duplicate send.
  - Otherwise, it updates `window.lsfCurrentStep` with the new value and allows sending.
- **Scenario:**  
  A user completing multi-step authentication where the same step should not trigger multiple analytics events.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Global Variable Reliance:**  
  The extension uses `window.lsfCurrentStep` for tracking in the "Logon Second Factor" journey. This global variable may be inadvertently modified by other scripts if not managed carefully.

- **String Comparison Sensitivity:**  
  The code heavily relies on lowercase string comparisons. Any variance in data formatting (for example, unexpected leading/trailing spaces) might cause the checks to fail.

- **Hard-Coded Narrative Checks:**  
  The specific values and prefixes checked in `EventNarrative` are hard-coded. Any changes in business requirements or event naming conventions will necessitate a code update.

- **Limited Defensive Checks on Property Existence:**  
  While the presence of `eventType` and `eventPayload` is guaranteed, the code assumes the existence and type of several payload properties (like `EventNarrative` and `JourneyName`). If these properties are missing or not strings when expected, the logic may not work as intended.

- **Potential Conflicts:**  
  If other Tealium iQ extensions use a similar mechanism or manipulate the same global variable (`window.lsfCurrentStep`), conflicts might occur, leading to unexpected behaviour.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Modularisation:**  
  Consider breaking the code into smaller ES5-compatible functions. For example, separate functions to handle:
  - Force sending checks.
  - URL and "cwa" page validations.
  - Narrative checks for "maketransaction".
  - Duplicate prevention for "Logon Second Factor".

- **Enhanced Defensive Checks:**  
  Although the presence of `eventType` and `eventPayload` is guaranteed, it may still be beneficial to verify that expected properties (such as `EventNarrative`) are of the correct type before operating on them, to prevent unexpected runtime errors.

- **Improved Comments and Documentation Inline:**  
  Adding inline comments to clarify the purpose of each conditional block may help future developers quickly understand and maintain the code.

- **Global Variable Management:**  
  To avoid conflicts, consider namespacing the global variable (e.g. `window.tealiumLSFCurrentStep`) or encapsulating it within an object that is less likely to cause collisions with other scripts.

- **Maintain ES5 Compatibility:**  
  All proposed improvements must continue to adhere to ES5 so as not to disrupt environments where ES2015/ES6 features are not supported.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Testing:**  
  Regularly test the extension in various environments to ensure that the conditions trigger correctly and duplicate events are prevented as expected.
  
- **Ownership & Code Reviews:**  
  Establish clear ownership for the extension within the team. Include peer code reviews for any modifications and maintain an updated changelog documenting significant alterations.

- **Dependency Audits:**  
  As the extension relies on specific global properties and URL path formats, it is important to periodically review these dependencies to ensure they remain valid as the website's structure and the data layer evolve.

- **Documentation Updates:**  
  Update this documentation alongside any code changes to ensure that new conditions, changes in event naming, or additional checks are correctly reflected.

- **Monitoring & Alerts:**  
  Consider implementing monitoring on the events processed by this extension. Alerts can help track if duplicate data sends occur due to unforeseen edge cases.
