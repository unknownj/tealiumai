# AEM Fragment Code Extension Documentation

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** AEM Fragment Code  
- **ID:** 1761  
- **Extension Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** DOM Ready  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Once  

### Summary

This extension is part of the Secure AEM Hub journey. It adds a click handler that listens for events on the document body, specifically targeting a button (or element) with the ID "showresult". Once triggered, it collects and processes form field data from the page, maps this data to specific tracking parameters on a Celebrus tag object, and fires off a tracking event via Tealium’s utag.track. In addition, if present, it forwards data to another analytics object (window.s). The extension is designed to support a single submission instance (run-once) per page load.

---

## 2. Code Explanation

### Global Conditions and Event Binding

- **Secure AEM Hub Check:**  
  The code begins by checking if the current URL pathname contains the string `"secure-aem-hub"`. This verifies whether the extension should run on the current page.

- **Click Event Listener on Document Body:**  
  A click event listener is added to the document’s body. This ensures that any click on a "showresult" button or its child elements triggers the associated logic.

### Key Logic Flow & Processing

1. **Target Element Identification:**  
   - The event handler first checks if the click event’s target or its parent has an attribute `id` equal to `"showresult"`. If not, the handler returns early.

2. **Tag Object and Index Management:**  
   - Retrieves the Celebrus tag object from `utag.sender[1222]`.  
   - Increments the `CelebrusSendIndex` property to record the submission instance.

3. **Mapping Data Fields:**  
   - Sets up a mapping between certain data fields in the tag object and the expected parameter names:
     - CelebrusFormID → "FormId"
     - CelebrusJourneyID → "FormInstanceId"
     - CelebrusSendIndex → "FormAttemptNumber"
     - CelebrusElementName → "ElementName"
     - CelebrusElementValue → "ElementValue"

4. **Form ID Derivation:**  
   - Attempts to extract the form identification from the URL parameters by:
     - Combining the query string and hash fragments.
     - Splitting the resulting string on “?” and “&”.
     - Filtering and mapping the parameter that starts with `"aempage="`.
   - This derived value is stored in `celebrusTagObject.formId`.

5. **GUID Generation for Journey ID:**  
   - If no `journeyId` exists, a new GUID is generated via a replace function that randomises hexadecimal digits.

6. **Data Layer Integration:**  
   - Retrieves the global data layer using `LBGAnalytics.datalayer.get()`.  
   - Extracts the `OCISID` and `Brand` values from the data layer.

7. **Field Extraction and Processing:**  
   - Selects all form fields with the class `.scep-input` and pairs their `name` attribute with their value.  
   - Additionally, retrieves fields from specific sections (`div.section > div.section-wrapper:not(.hide)`) having the `scep-template` attribute.  
   - Duplicates are removed and empty values are filtered out.

8. **Tracking Event Dispatch:**  
   - Uses `window.utag.track` to send a tracking event with the event type `"form"`, including:
     - Form and journey IDs.
     - The send index.
     - Aggregated lists of field names and values.
     - Data layer values (OCISID and Brand).
   - The tracking call is scoped exclusively to the Celebrus tag via `uids: [1222]`.

9. **Optional Window.s Data Assignment:**  
   - If the global `s` object exists, additional properties (`prop61`, `prop62`, and others) are set for further tracking.
   - Only up to a total of 9 fields are processed into separate `s.prop[63..]` properties.

10. **Error Handling:**  
    - All of the tracking logic is wrapped in a try/catch block.  
    - Any exceptions are caught and logged to the console using `console.log(e)`.

### Global Dependencies

- **utag and utag.sender:** Provided by Tealium iQ for tracking events.
- **LBGAnalytics.datalayer:** Expected to be available to retrieve additional tracking data.
- **window.s:** A global analytics object (if present) for setting extra data properties.

---

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Operation

- **Scenario:**  
  When a user navigates to a URL containing `"secure-aem-hub"` and then clicks the "showresult" button:
  - The code verifies the environment condition.
  - The click event is detected and the clicking element is verified.
  - Form fields (both input fields and specific section elements) are collected.
  - The script extracts the `aempage` value from the URL to set the Form ID.
  - A unique journey ID is generated if not present.
  - A tracking event is dispatched via `utag.track` with all collected data.
  - If available, additional properties are attached using the global `s` object.

### Edge Cases

- **No "showresult" Button Click:**  
  If a user clicks somewhere else on the page:
  - The event handler checks the `id` of the target or its parent.
  - Since neither matches `"showresult"`, the function returns early without sending any tracking.

- **Missing Celebrus Tag Object:**  
  If `utag.sender[1222]` is undefined:
  - The code immediately exits the try block, and no event data is processed or sent.
  
- **Incomplete Form Data:**  
  - Any form field with an empty string value is filtered out before the event is sent.
  
- **Absence of Global Data Layer or window.s:**  
  - The code assumes `LBGAnalytics.datalayer.get()` and `window.s` are available; if they are absent, dependent tracking steps are skipped without breaking the entire handler.

---

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Strict Dependency on URL Structure:**  
  The extension relies on the presence of `"aempage="` within the URL’s query string and hash. If the URL structure differs, the Form ID derivation might fail.

- **Event Target Verification:**  
  Only elements with the `id` `"showresult"` (or whose parent has this id) trigger the logic. Any change in HTML structure may prevent the event from firing correctly.

- **Global Object Dependencies:**  
  The extension assumes that global objects like `utag`, `LBGAnalytics`, and possibly `window.s` are available. If these objects are removed or altered in future versions, the extension’s functionality could break.

- **One-Time Execution:**  
  The extension is configured to run once on page load ("Run Once" and "DOM Ready"). It does not support repeated form submissions within the same page session.

- **Limited Field Processing for window.s:**  
  Only the first nine field submissions are processed into `window.s` properties. This might not capture all field data if the form contains more entries.

- **Error Handling Simplicity:**  
  Errors are only logged to the console with no additional error reporting or fallback functionality.

- **Potential Conflicts:**  
  If other Tealium extensions manipulate the same global objects or similar tracking events, there might be conflicts in attribute mapping or event handling.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Modularise the Code:**  
  Break the logic into smaller functions (e.g. a function to derive the Form ID, another to collect form fields, etc.) to increase readability and reuse.

- **Enhanced Error Handling:**  
  Consider adding more robust error handling or external error reporting rather than a simple console log. This would help diagnose issues in production.

- **Defensive Programming:**  
  While defensive checks for eventType and eventPayload are not required, ensure defensive coding for other dependent global objects. Validate that `parentElement` exists before accessing its attributes.

- **Consistency in Commenting and Formatting:**  
  Ensure comments are consistent and follow the same style throughout. Clear inline documentation about the purpose of each block would assist future maintainers.

- **Avoid Code Duplication:**  
  Try to combine or refactor duplicate logic (e.g. similar field processing for different selectors) into common utility functions.

- **Testing Enhancements:**  
  Add unit tests or use a staging environment to simulate form submissions and URL variations, ensuring every logical branch is exercised.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  - Regularly check for changes in the URL structure or HTML element IDs that might impact the extension's functionality.  
  - Validate that dependencies on external libraries (e.g., Tealium’s utag, LBGAnalytics) are up-to-date and functioning.

- **Ownership and Versioning:**  
  - Maintain version control for this extension.  
  - Clearly document any changes, especially changes to key logic such as field mapping or data extraction.

- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Set up automated tests where feasible to simulate clicks and verify that the correct data is being sent via utag.track.  
  - Perform regression testing whenever changes are made to ensure compatibility with other Tealium iQ extensions.

- **Documentation Updates:**  
  - Update this documentation as the extension evolves.  
  - Ensure that any refactoring or new dependencies are reflected to keep stakeholders informed.

- **Future Enhancements:**  
  - Consider abstracting the GUID generation and URL parameter extraction into shared utility libraries if similar logic is used across multiple extensions.
