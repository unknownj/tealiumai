## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** CM GDC : TAG : Set : Payload : Source, Type and Category Variables  
- **ID:** 1764  
- **Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** 1516, 1518  
- **Execution Frequency:**  
  - Executed as part of the tag firing process where the extension inspects and modifies the event payload.  
  - Runs every time an associated Google DoubleClick tag is fired.  

- **Summary:**  
  - **Primary Function:**  
    - Ensures the DC_target datalayer variable is populated before proceeding with tag firing.
    - Splits the DC_target string into constituents using the '!' delimiter.
  - **Mapping Behaviour:**  
    - If the DC_target has two values: these are mapped to DC_type and DC_cat.
    - If three values are present: they are assumed to be DC_src, DC_type, and DC_cat.
    - If five values are present: four values are mapped to DC_src, DC_type, DC_cat, ConversionID, and ConversionLabel.
  - **Additional Responsibility:**  
    - Sets up a global (or event-scope) variable, gtagobj, that concatenates DC_src, DC_type, and DC_cat joined by a '/' separator for further use in tag firing.
  - **Why It Exists:**  
    - To enforce data integrity for tags by preventing tag firing if required payload elements (specifically DC_target) are missing.
    - To prepare and standardise the payload data for various tag implementations (DoubleClick and Google Ads) from a single source variable.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables & Structures

- **Global Variables & Parameters:**  
  - `a`: Represents the eventType.
  - `b`: Represents the eventPayload which holds key data values (e.g. DC_target).
  - `u`: Represents the tagObject which may also include auxiliary references (e.g. u.extend, a global array of extension functions).

- **Active Flag & Extensions:**  
  - The variable `active` is used to indicate if the current code snippet has been executed as part of the extension chain.  
  - The loop traverses `u.extend` (a list of extension functions) to verify and correct execution order by searching for a unique marker string (`"__this_exact_extension__"`) and then checking for presence of `"DC_target"` in the subsequent extensions.

- **Logging:**  
  - When the execution order is found to be off, a log is generated via `utag.DB` for debugging purposes.

### Core Functions

1. **checkDcTarget()**  
   - **Purpose:** Validates that the datalayer variable `b.DC_target` exists and is not falsy (or equivalent to 0).
   - **Return:** Returns `false` if not populated; otherwise, returns `true`.

2. **unpackDc(dcValues)**  
   - **Purpose:** Splits the `DC_target` string into an array using the '!' delimiter.
   - **Return:** An array (`dcArray`) containing the segmented parts.

3. **createDefaultObj(arr)**  
   - **Purpose:** Maps an array of 2 elements to an object when only DC_type and DC_cat values are provided.
   - **Mappings:**  
     - `DC_type`: arr[0]
     - `DC_cat`: arr[1]

4. **createSrcObj(arr)**  
   - **Purpose:** Maps an array of 3 elements into an object for cases where DC_src is present.
   - **Mappings:**  
     - `DC_src`: arr[0]
     - `DC_type`: arr[1]
     - `DC_cat`: arr[2]

5. **createGADObj(arr)**  
   - **Purpose:** Maps an array of 5 elements to an object to handle Google Ads conversion data.
   - **Mappings:**  
     - `DC_src`: arr[0]
     - `DC_type`: arr[1]
     - `DC_cat`: arr[2]
     - `ConversionID`: arr[3]
     - `ConversionLabel`: arr[4]

### Logic Flow

1. **Execution Order Check:**  
   - Iterates through the extensions in `u.extend` to enforce proper order.
   - If the extension with the unique marker has been executed and a subsequent extension using `"DC_target"` is found, it logs a debug message and invokes that extension to correct the order.

2. **Payload Verification:**  
   - Calls `checkDcTarget()` to determine if the `b.DC_target` is available; if not, the extension halts by returning `false`.

3. **Payload Processing:**  
   - `unpackDc()` is invoked to split the `DC_target` string into an array `dcValues`.
   - Based on the length of `dcValues`:
     - Length of 2: Uses `createDefaultObj` to create an object with DC_type and DC_cat.
     - Length of 3: Uses `createSrcObj` to create an object with DC_src, DC_type, and DC_cat.
     - Length of 5: Uses `createGADObj` to handle Google Ads conversion-related values in addition to the normal fields.

4. **Payload Merging:**  
   - Iterates through the created object and merges each key-value pair into `b` (eventPayload), thus overwriting or setting DC_src, DC_type, DC_cat, etc.

5. **Global Variable for gtag (pegasus):**  
   - If the DC_target value parts count is at least 3, a new variable (`gtagobj`) is created by concatenating `DC_src`, `DC_type`, and `DC_cat` with '/' delimiters.

### Dependencies

- The extension implicitly depends on the following:
  - Global event parameters: `eventType` (a) and `eventPayload` (b).
  - The `u.extend` array from the tagObject, which holds a list of extension functions.
  - The logging function `utag.DB` for debugging purposes.
  - Standard JavaScript methods such as `split()` for string processing.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Example 1: Two-Part DC_target

- **Input:**  
  - eventPayload.DC_target = "banner!homepage"
- **Processing:**  
  - `unpackDc()` produces: [ "banner", "homepage" ]
  - `createDefaultObj()` maps:
    - DC_type = "banner"
    - DC_cat = "homepage"
  - The merged eventPayload now includes:
    - DC_type: "banner"
    - DC_cat: "homepage"
- **Global Output:**  
  - Since the length is 2, `gtagobj` is not set (it requires at least 3 parts).

### Example 2: Three-Part DC_target

- **Input:**  
  - eventPayload.DC_target = "srcA!video!promo"
- **Processing:**  
  - `unpackDc()` produces: [ "srcA", "video", "promo" ]
  - `createSrcObj()` maps:
    - DC_src = "srcA"
    - DC_type = "video"
    - DC_cat = "promo"
  - The final eventPayload now includes:
    - DC_src: "srcA"
    - DC_type: "video"
    - DC_cat: "promo"
- **Global Output:**  
  - `gtagobj` becomes "srcA/video/promo".

### Example 3: Five-Part DC_target (Google Ads)

- **Input:**  
  - eventPayload.DC_target = "srcB!display!sport!12345!abcde"
- **Processing:**  
  - `unpackDc()` produces: [ "srcB", "display", "sport", "12345", "abcde" ]
  - `createGADObj()` maps:
    - DC_src = "srcB"
    - DC_type = "display"
    - DC_cat = "sport"
    - ConversionID = "12345"
    - ConversionLabel = "abcde"
  - The final eventPayload will now include these five values.
- **Global Output:**  
  - `gtagobj` becomes "srcB/display/sport".

### Edge Condition: Missing DC_target

- **Input:**  
  - eventPayload.DC_target is either unset or equals 0.
- **Processing:**  
  - `checkDcTarget()` returns false.
  - The extension returns false and aborts further processing – the tag is not fired.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Execution Order Dependency:**  
  - The code contains a workaround for extension ordering (“Ugly fudge”) which suggests that if another extension with `"DC_target"` is executed after the current one, the order is fixed by invoking it again.  
  - This may lead to unintended side-effects if multiple extensions manipulate the same payload variable.

- **Assumption on Array Length:**  
  - The code strictly checks for lengths of 2, 3, or 5.  
  - Any deviation (e.g., 4-part values) will not be mapped, and the payload might be left incomplete.

- **Logging Dependency:**  
  - Relies on `utag.DB` for debugging; if debugging is not enabled or if the function is overridden by another script, this may hinder troubleshooting.

- **Global Namespace Impact:**  
  - The assignment of `gtagobj` without a declared variable (using bare assignment) may pollute the global namespace, potentially conflicting with other scripts if not carefully namespaced.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Modularisation & Code Structure:**  
  - Consider splitting the code into smaller modules or functions (if supported) for better readability and reusability.
  - Maintain clear separation of utility functions (e.g. unpackDc, createDefaultObj, etc.) from the main processing logic.

- **Defensive Checks:**  
  - Even though eventType and eventPayload are guaranteed, additional defensive coding for `b.DC_target` format and type verification could improve robustness.
  - Validate that the split array produces expected types of values (e.g. strings) before mapping.

- **Enhance Logging:**  
  - Introduce more descriptive logging to capture unexpected scenarios, such as an array length that is not 2, 3, or 5.
  - Consider wrapping logging in a condition to ensure it only runs in debug mode to avoid performance delays in production.

- **Global Namespace Protection:**  
  - Rather than assigning `gtagobj` without declaration, it would be beneficial to attach it to a defined namespace (e.g., eventPayload or another dedicated object) to avoid clashes in the global scope.

- **Ordering Logic:**  
  - Revisit the “extension ordering” workaround. A refactor to enforce the correct execution order via configuration rather than runtime code could reduce complexity and potential conflicts.

*Note: Since ES5 is required, avoid ES6+ syntax (e.g. arrow functions, const/let, template literals) and maintain usage of ES5 conventions.*
