# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: CM GDC : TAG : Set : JourneyProduct Product Lookup

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name**: CM GDC : TAG : Set : JourneyProduct product lookup
- **ID**: 1767
- **Type**: Lookup Table
- **Scope**: 1517, 1518
- **Execution Frequency**: On every event trigger

### Summary
This extension serves to map various parameters essential for Google DoubleClick (DC) tags related to journey products. The mapping is hardcoded within the extension to ensure consistency across all Google DC tags. By maintaining a single source of truth for the mappings, any updates to variable names need to be made in only one location, simplifying future maintenance and reducing the risk of discrepancies.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- **b.DC_target**: Checks if DC_target is defined; if not, it assigns `b.DC_src` to `b.DCSrcLkp`.
- **u.map**: An object used to hold key-value pairs where the keys represent the parameters expected by the Google DC tags and the values represent the corresponding variables to be sent.

### Logic Flow
1. The extension begins by checking if the `DC_target` property exists in the `b` object.
2. If `DC_target` is undefined, it assigns a source value based on `DCSrcLkp`.
3. It defines a mapping object, `u.map`, which contains mappings for multiple parameters like `DC_type`, `DC_cat`, `paid_order_id`, etc.
4. The final loop iterates over the `b` object to ensure that no Personally Identifiable Information (PII) leaks through. Specifically, it checks for the presence of an "@" symbol in string properties and clears them if found.

### Dependencies
- This extension relies on global objects `b` and `u`, which are typically passed from the Tealium environment. There are no external library dependencies.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Sample Scenario 
- **Normal Flow**: A user initiates a purchase journey, and relevant details are captured:
    1. The journey amount is determined and mapped to `JourneyAmount`.
    2. The application ID is resolved, and subsequently, `applicationID` is populated.
   
- **Edge Condition**: If the user's data inadvertently contains an email address (e.g., `user@example.com`):
    1. The loop checking for PII will identify the `@` symbol.
    2. Consequently, any string containing an email would be sanitized (cleared), ensuring compliance with data protection standards.

### Output Handling
- The mappings are seamlessly integrated into the DC tags upon execution, allowing accurate data tracking across user interactions.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Potential Failures**: If the `b` object does not properly initialise, the extension may not function as intended.
- **Variable Conflicts**: If different extensions redefine keys outlined in `u.map` concurrently, there may be clashes or data integrity issues.
- Careful consideration is required when adjusting mappings, as legacy systems may depend on specific parameter names.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks**: Even though eventType and eventPayload are guaranteed, consider implementing checks for unexpected null or undefined values in mappings to enhance error resilience.
- **Code Style**: Maintain consistent variable naming for readability (e.g., use camelCase throughout).
- **Modularization**: Consider breaking the logic into smaller functions or clearly defined sections for easier testing and understanding.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance**: Regularly review the mappings to ensure compatibility with changes to Google DC or other associated services.
- **Ownership**: Designate a team member to oversee the extension's functionality and any updates.
- **Testing Guidelines**: Create a suite of test cases that cover normal flows, as well as edge cases, to validate the extensionâ€™s performance during both development and production stages.
