# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** CM : TAG : Set : Mappings : Source, Type and Category Variables  
- **Extension ID:** 1770  
- **Library/Parent Extension ID:** 100036  
- **Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** 1518 (applies to all Google DoubleClick tags)  
- **Execution Frequency:** Runs each time a Google DoubleClick tag is processed

**Summary:**  
This extension injects a mapping object into each Google DoubleClick tag. The mapping object (stored on the supplied tag object) relates various Tealium and Google DoubleClick variables. The purpose is to centralise the configuration of mapping data, allowing a single change in the extension to propagate across all the Google DoubleClick tags. In addition, it includes logic to filter out potential personally identifiable information (PII) and conditionally remove identifiers when Google Consent mode does not authorise data sharing.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- **a (eventType):** Represents the event type name, passed in as a string.  
- **b (eventPayload):** Object containing data for the current event/tag invocation.  
- **u (tagObject):** The tag object where the mapping (`u.map`) is injected and later used by the tag logic.

### Logic Flow
1. **Initial Check:**  
   - The code checks if the property `DC_target` is missing from the payload (`b`).  
   - If `DC_target` is undefined, it sets the source variable:  
     `b.DC_src = b.DCSrcLkp;`  
   This ensures that if no specific target is provided, the alternate source lookup (`DCSrcLkp`) is used.

2. **Mapping Injection:**  
   - The extension creates or replaces the mapping object on the tag object (`u.map`) with a predefined set of key-value pairs.  
   - Each key in the mapping object corresponds to a DoubleClick or other marketing-related parameter, and the associated value indicates the mapped variable name.  
   - Examples include `"DC_type":"type", "DC_cat":"cat"`, etc.

3. **PII Filtering:**  
   - The code iterates over every key of `b` (the eventPayload).  
   - For each property with a string value, it checks if the string contains "@" or "%40" (which are typical indicators of an email address).  
   - If found, the value is blanked out by setting it to an empty string.  
   This logic aims to prevent accidental transmission of PII.

4. **Consent Mode Handling:**  
   - The extension utilises the global object `LBGAnalytics.privacy` to decode the consent cookie.  
   - If the decoded status code is not "y" or "t" (indicating consent), then sensitive identifiers are removed from the mapping object:
     - `paid_order_id`
     - `FirstPartyCookie`
     - `applicationID`
     - `MobileAdvertiserID`  
   This ensures that identifiers are only injected when consent is provided.

### Dependencies
- **Global Objects:**  
  - `eventType` (string) and `eventPayload` (object) are expected to be provided at execution.  
  - `LBGAnalytics.privacy.decodeCookie()` must return an object with a `statusCode` property.
- **Tealium iQ Environment:**  
  - The extension is designed for use in the Tealium iQ environment and assumes that the mapping (`u.map`) is compatible with all Google DoubleClick tag configurations.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Standard Operation with Consent

**Input:**  
- The eventPayload (`b`) contains various properties including potential DoubleClick variables (`DCSrcLkp`) and others.  
- The consent cookie status code returned by `LBGAnalytics.privacy.decodeCookie()` is either "y" or "t".

**Process:**  
- If `b.DC_target` is absent, `b.DC_src` will be assigned the value of `b.DCSrcLkp`.  
- The mapping object (`u.map`) is injected with all the mappings as defined in the code.  
- The PII loop scans each property in `b` and wipes any values containing "@" or "%40".  
- All identifiers remain intact in `u.map` because valid consent is provided.

**Output:**  
- The Google DoubleClick tag will execute with a complete mapping object and any potential PII removed from the eventPayload.

### Scenario 2: Operation Without Consent

**Input:**  
- As in Scenario 1 except the consent cookie status returns a value other than "y" or "t" (e.g. "n").

**Process:**  
- The initial mapping injection occurs as before.  
- The PII filtering step runs to scrub any PII from the eventPayload.  
- Post PII-cleansing, the code deletes sensitive mapping key values (`paid_order_id`, `FirstPartyCookie`, `applicationID`, `MobileAdvertiserID`) from `u.map`.

**Output:**  
- The DoubleClick tag will work with a reduced mapping object excluding the sensitive identifiers, thereby respecting user privacy.

### Scenario 3: Edge Case for PII Scrubbing

**Input:**  
- The eventPayload contains multiple string properties including one with an encoded email (e.g. "%40example.com").

**Process:**  
- The iteration over `b` identifies the property value containing "%40".  
- That property is cleared (set to an empty string).

**Output:**  
- The eventPayload is scrubbed and no email address persists in any of the properties, ensuring compliance with privacy rules.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Dependency on Global Objects:**  
  - The extension assumes that `LBGAnalytics.privacy.decodeCookie()` is available and functions reliably. Failure in this dependency might cause runtime errors or unexpected behaviour.  
- **PII Filtering Simplicity:**  
  - The current PII detection only looks for "@" and "%40" which may be overly simplistic. Legitimate strings not containing email information might be erroneously cleared if they match these conditions accidentally.
- **Mapping Overwrites:**  
  - The mapping object (`u.map`) is completely overwritten on execution. If other extensions or scripts also manipulate `u.map`, there could be conflicts or loss of data.
- **Global Pollutions:**  
  - As the script loops through all properties of `b`, if there are non-string properties or large objects, unintended side effects in processing may occur.
- **Consent Code Dependency:**  
  - The deletion of mappings based on consent relies on the string comparison with strict expected values ("y" or "t"). Any deviation in the consent cookie's value format will not deactivate the removal of sensitive identifiers.

---

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks:**  
  - Although the availability of `eventType` and `eventPayload` is guaranteed, consider adding checks around `LBGAnalytics.privacy.decodeCookie()` to ensure it returns a valid object before accessing `statusCode`.
  
- **Modularisation:**  
  - Extract the PII sanitisation logic into a separate utility function to improve readability and facilitate unit testing.
  - Similarly, the consent-mode logic could be modularised to separate the removal of identifiers from the mapping object.

- **Avoiding Global Pollution:**  
  - Although ES5 is required, consider creating an IIFE wrapper (as is already done) to minimise the chance of polluting the global scope.
  
- **Comment Enhancements:**  
  - Expand on inline comments to include rationale behind each conditional check, particularly for consent mode logic and property cleansing.
  
- **Testing and Logging:**  
  - Introduce logging (in a manner that complies with Tealium iQ capabilities) for cases where mapping keys are deleted due to consent issues. This may help with debugging in a live environment.
  
- **Consistent Coding Style:**  
  - Ensure that the code follows consistent indentation and use of semicolons for clarity and maintainability.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Maintenance Guidelines:**  
  - Code reviews should focus on ensuring that any new mappings or changes in existing ones are reflected consistently across all Google DoubleClick tags.
  - Monitor external dependencies (such as `LBGAnalytics.privacy`) for any changes in API or return format that could affect the consent mode logic.
  
- **Ownership:**  
  - Assign clear ownership for this extension, ideally someone within the team who is familiar with both Tealium iQ and Google DoubleClick integrations.  
  - Maintain documentation alongside the code for any updates or changes to the mapping object.
  
- **Testing:**  
  - Unit tests should be created for the PII scraping function and the consent-based deletion logic.  
  - Integration tests should simulate different consent statuses and payload configurations.
  
- **Change Management:**  
  - Any updates to the mappings (i.e. changes in key names or new mappings) should be coordinated with teams dependent on the Google DoubleClick tag integrations.
  - Deploy changes in a controlled environment and monitor in real-time to ensure no unexpected data loss is occurring.
