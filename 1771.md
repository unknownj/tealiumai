# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: Event Volume Counts

## 1. Extension Overview
- **Name**: Event Volume Counts
- **ID**: 100036
- **Type**: Javascript Code
- **Scope**: After Tag Extensions
- **Execution Frequency**: Run Always

### Summary
The "Event Volume Counts" extension is designed to maintain a record of event volume data within the `LBGAnalytics` global object. It collects and aggregates data based on original event data values and facilitates analytics tracking for various events. This is essential for monitoring user interactions and making data-driven decisions based on engagement metrics.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- `window.LBGAnalytics`: A global object used for tracking analytics-related data.
- `eventVolumes`: This property under `LBGAnalytics` holds an array that stores the original event data.

### Logic Flow
1. **Initialization**: 
   - The extension checks for the existence of the `LBGAnalytics` object. If it does not exist, it initializes it.
   - It subsequently checks for the `eventVolumes` property within `LBGAnalytics` and initializes it as an empty array if it does not exist.
   
2. **Data Processing**:
   - The extension uses the variable `a` (which is expected to be the event type) to create a dynamic key for storing corresponding event volume data.
   - The extension then pushes the value of `b.OriginalEventData`, representing the original event data, into the relevant array. If this data is not available, "Data not found" is pushed as a placeholder.

### Dependencies
- The extension relies on the presence of the `window` object since it is a browser-based Javascript implementation. No external libraries or frameworks are directly referenced within the code.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Condition
Assume `a` is "click" and `b.OriginalEventData` contains `{eventCategory: "buttons", eventLabel: "signup"}`. The extension will execute as follows:
```javascript
window.LBGAnalytics.eventVolumes["click"].push({eventCategory: "buttons", eventLabel: "signup"});
```
This adds a record for a button click event to the `click` array.

### Edge Conditions
- **Missing `OriginalEventData`**: If `b.OriginalEventData` is undefined or non-existent, the following will occur:
```javascript
window.LBGAnalytics.eventVolumes[a].push("Data not found");
```
This ensures that the extension gracefully handles missing data without throwing errors.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas
- **Data Overwrites**: If the same event type (`a`) is recorded multiple times, it will append to the existing array, potentially leading the array to grow large. Developers should monitor memory usage if events are fired frequently.
- **No Event Validation**: There are no checks for the validity or format of `OriginalEventData`, which could lead to inconsistent data formats within the stored arrays.
- **Dependency on Global Variables**: As the extension relies heavily on global objects, conflicts may arise if other scripts manipulate `window.LBGAnalytics` or its properties.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring
- **Modularisation**: Consider refactoring the code into smaller functions, such as one for initialisation and another for data aggregation. This improves readability and maintainability.
  
- **Prevent Duplicate Initialisations**: Introduce a check to prevent the initialisation of `LBGAnalytics` or `eventVolumes` if they already exist, as a safeguard against redundant operations.

- **Event Type Validation**: While data validity is guaranteed by external contracts, consider adding utility functions to validate event types and structures. This would make debugging easier if contracts change in the future.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes
- **Ownership**: Assign a specific developer or team to oversee updates and maintenance of this extension. Establish a protocol for reviewing changes and updates to prevent conflicts with other extensions.

- **Testing Guidelines**: Regularly test the extension in a staging environment to ascertain data integrity. Verify that data stored in `eventVolumes` reflects real user interactions.

- **Documentation Updates**: Ensure that any changes to the extension code are reflected in the documentation promptly to maintain accuracy.
