# Event Volume Counts Extension Documentation

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Event Volume Counts  
- **ID:** 1771  
- **Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** After Tag Extensions  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Always  

**Summary:**  
This extension is designed to capture and log event volume data by pushing event information into a global data structure. It creates (if not already available) a global object (window.LBGAnalytics) with a child property (eventVolumes) designed to store event data in an array. The code then appends the current event data to a specific array index (determined by the variable "a")—using event data provided as b.OriginalEventData. This mechanism provides a centralised spot where event volumes can be tracked and reviewed, enabling later analytics or debugging.

## 2. Code Explanation

**Key Global Objects and Variables:**  
- `window.LBGAnalytics`: The top-level global namespace for LBG analytics-related data.  
- `window.LBGAnalytics.eventVolumes`: An object intended to store arrays of event data.  
- `a`: A variable used as a key to index into the `eventVolumes` object. It is assumed to be defined in the execution context.  
- `b.OriginalEventData`: The event data payload from the current event, expected to be a valid data point. If this is missing or falsy, the string "Data not found" is used instead.

**Logic Flow:**  
1. **Initialisation of Global Object:**  
   - The code first checks if `window.LBGAnalytics` exists and if not, initialises it as an empty object.
   - Similarly, it ensures that `window.LBGAnalytics.eventVolumes` exists.

2. **Array Initialisation for Key 'a':**  
   - For the key represented by variable `a`, the code creates an array (if it does not already exist) in `window.LBGAnalytics.eventVolumes[a]`.

3. **Pushing Event Data:**  
   - The code then pushes the event data into the array. It uses `b.OriginalEventData` if available, otherwise, it defaults to the string `"Data not found"`.

**Dependencies:**  
- The extension depends on the availability of global variables `a` and `b` with the property `OriginalEventData`.
- It also depends on the global usage of the `window` object to store the analytics data.
- There are no external libraries required beyond the Tealium iQ library itself.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Scenario
Assume:  
- Variable `a` is set to a specific event identifier (e.g. "clicks").
- `b.OriginalEventData` contains valid event details (e.g. "{ eventType: 'click', timestamp: 1633036800000 }").

Execution Flow:
- The system checks for `window.LBGAnalytics` and creates it if missing.
- `window.LBGAnalytics.eventVolumes` is ensured to exist.
- An array is instantiated at `window.LBGAnalytics.eventVolumes["clicks"]` if it is not already initialised.
- The valid event payload is pushed to the array.

Result:
- The `eventVolumes` object might look like:  
  {  
  "clicks": [{ eventType: 'click', timestamp: 1633036800000 }]  
  }

### Edge Condition
Assume:
- Variable `a` is properly defined.
- `b.OriginalEventData` is undefined or falsy.

Execution Flow:
- The system performs the same checks and creates the structure as above.
- Since `b.OriginalEventData` is not present, the code pushes the string `"Data not found"` to the respective array.

Result:
- The `eventVolumes` object might look like:  
  {  
  "a": ["Data not found"]  
  }

_Note:_ The exact key used in the object depends on the runtime value of variable `a`.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Variable Assumptions:**  
  - The code assumes that the variables `a` and `b` are defined in the global or execution scope before this extension runs. Their absence may lead to unexpected errors.
  
- **Data Defaulting:**  
  - If `b.OriginalEventData` is not provided, the extension always defaults to pushing `"Data not found"`. This may hide issues with event data collection.
  
- **Global Namespace Pollution:**  
  - The extension utilises the global `window` object. Other scripts or extensions that modify `window.LBGAnalytics` or `window.LBGAnalytics.eventVolumes` might interfere, causing potential conflicts.

- **Tealium Extensions Compatibility:**  
  - Ensure that no other extension modifies the same global objects in conflicting ways. Order of execution in the "After Tag Extensions" scope should be verified when multiple extensions target these globals.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks:**  
  - While it is guaranteed that properties like eventType (string) or eventPayload (object) exist, consider verifying that `a` and `b` are defined before proceeding. Adding comments or simple checks can prevent future issues if usage expectations change.

- **Code Modularity:**  
  - If additional processing or different types of event data need handling, consider refactoring the code into smaller helper functions. This can improve readability and maintainability.

- **Documentation Inline:**  
  - Add inline comments to explain the purpose of the key lines of code. This will assist future developers in understanding why the initialisation and data push occur in this manner.

- **Error Handling Improvements:**  
  - Depending on usage, consider logging warnings if critical variables (like `b.OriginalEventData`) are missing to aid in debugging any downstream issues.

- **Global Namespace Management:**  
  - Where possible, limit extensive usage of the global namespace. Consider encapsulating code in a closure if additional functionality is added later.

> Note: All refactoring suggestions should maintain ES5 compatibility—avoid using ES6+ features like arrow functions, const/let declarations, or template literals.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  - Regularly review the extension to ensure compatibility with updates in Tealium iQ and any changes in global event object structures.
  - Keep track of the usage of the global `window.LBGAnalytics` namespace to avoid conflicts if more analytics functionality is added.

- **Ownership:**  
  - Assign a clear owner or team responsible for analytics-related extensions who can review and update code in response to new requirements or changes in event tracking.

- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Include unit tests that mock the global `window` object to verify that arrays are created correctly and that event data is pushed as expected.
  - Test both normal and edge conditions (i.e. when `b.OriginalEventData` is missing) to ensure that data integrity is maintained.

- **Version Control:**  
  - Use appropriate version control tags in your repository to track changes to this extension code and its documentation. This ensures that any refactoring or bug fixes are well documented.
