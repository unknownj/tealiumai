# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation

This document provides detailed information about the "CM : GAD : Set : Mappings" extension. It covers the extension overview, code explanation, usage examples, known limitations, recommendations for refactoring, and maintenance notes.

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** CM : GAD : Set : Mappings  
- **Extension ID:** 1772 (Library extensionId: 100036)  
- **Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** 1516 (Applies to all Google DoubleClick/Adwords tags in scope)  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run on each event trigger for assigned tags

**Summary:**  
This extension injects a mapping object into Google DoubleClick tags. This mapping object defines how various data attributes from Tealium are relabelled when passed to Google Adwords tags. By centralising the mapping in one place, any modifications to the mappings automatically propagate to all Google DoubleClick tags, thereby streamlining updates and reducing maintenance efforts. An additional logic block further ensures that in cases where user consent is restricted, sensitive identifiers are removed from the mapping.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables and Parameters

- **Parameters:**  
  - `a`: Represents the eventType (string) used by Tealium.  
  - `b`: Represents the eventPayload (object) from Tealium.  
  - `u`: Represents the tagObject, an object holding tag-specific configurations and objects.

- **Mapping Object (`u.map`):**  
  The `u.map` object is hard-coded with key-value pairs mapping Tealium data layer variable names (keys) to the corresponding Google Adwords data attribute names (values). For example:  
  - `"ConversionID": "conversion_id"`  
  - `"ApplicationID": "custom.application_id"`

### Logic Flow

1. **Mapping Injection:**  
   The function immediately assigns a hard-coded mapping object to `u.map`. This object is available for Google DoubleClick tags, ensuring consistency across all tags that use this mapping.

2. **Consent Mode Condition:**  
   - The extension checks the user’s consent status using a method `LBGAnalytics.privacy.decodeCookie()` (which is expected to be available globally).  
   - If the consent status (accessed via `.statusCode`) is not found in the allowed values (["y", "t"]) – indicating that the user has not consented – sensitive mapping keys are removed. Specifically, `paid_order_id` and `ApplicationID` fields are deleted from `u.map`.

### Dependencies

- **Global Objects and Methods:**  
  - `LBGAnalytics.privacy.decodeCookie()`: This function must be available globally as it is used to determine the user consent mode.  
  - `eventType`, `eventPayload`, and `tagObject`: These parameters are provided by the Tealium environment and are guaranteed to be present.

- **External Libraries:**  
  - No external libraries are explicitly loaded within this code snippet aside from the dependency on the Tealium environment and the `LBGAnalytics` object.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Operation Scenario

- **Case:** User has provided consent.
  - **Process:**  
    - `LBGAnalytics.privacy.decodeCookie().statusCode` returns either "y" or "t".  
    - The mapping object `u.map` remains intact with all defined keys, including sensitive identifiers like `paid_order_id` and `ApplicationID`.
  - **Outcome:**  
    - Google DoubleClick tags receive the full mapping object, ensuring that all relevant data (including sensitive identifiers) is passed correctly.

### Edge Case Scenario

- **Case:** User has not provided consent.
  - **Process:**  
    - `LBGAnalytics.privacy.decodeCookie().statusCode` returns a value other than "y" or "t".  
    - The extension deletes `u.map.paid_order_id` and `u.map.ApplicationID`.
  - **Outcome:**  
    - The mapping object provided to the tags does not include the sensitive identifiers, aligning with privacy requirements.

### Data Flow Illustration

1. **Input:** Tealium event triggers the extension with `eventType` and `eventPayload`.
2. **Processing:**  
   - The hard-coded mapping is assigned to `tagObject.map`.
   - The consent check is performed.
   - If necessary, sensitive keys are removed.
3. **Output:** The updated `tagObject` is utilised by Google DoubleClick/Adwords tags for transaction or conversion tracking.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Consent Dependency:**  
  The extension assumes the `LBGAnalytics.privacy.decodeCookie()` function is available and works as expected. If this global object or method changes, the consent-related removal of mapping keys may fail.

- **Hard-Coded Values:**  
  The mapping keys are hard-coded within the extension. While this ensures consistency, any requirement for dynamic mapping (based on different contexts) necessitates code modification.

- **Potential Tag Conflicts:**  
  Since this mapping is global to all related tags, any other extension modifying `u.map` for similar tags may lead to unexpected behaviour if not carefully managed.

- **Edge Cases Not Handled:**  
  No fallback handling is provided in cases where the cookie decoding fails (e.g. unexpected structure in the cookie data). Although the presence of `eventType` and `eventPayload` is guaranteed, similar guarantees are not made for the structure of `LBGAnalytics.privacy.decodeCookie()` output.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Additional Defensive Checks:**  
  - Consider verifying that `LBGAnalytics.privacy.decodeCookie()` returns an object with the expected property `statusCode` before performing the index check.
  - Validate `u` to ensure that it supports the expected mapping assignment before adding or deleting properties.

- **Code Style Consistency:**  
  - Add comments to explain each major code block, especially within the consent check logic.
  - Maintain consistent spacing and indentation to improve readability.

- **Modularisation:**  
  - If similar mapping logic is used elsewhere, consider abstracting the mapping assignment and consent check into reusable functions.
  - Keep the mapping definition in a reusable configuration if future updates may need to support multiple mapping rules for different tag types.

- **Documentation and Testing:**  
  - Include unit tests or integration tests that simulate different consent states and verify the integrity of `u.map` modifications.
  - Confirm that the extension behaves as expected when used in conjunction with other Tealium extensions.

*Note:* Given the requirement to support ES5, avoid using modern ES2015/ES6 features such as arrow functions, let/const, or template literals.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  - Ensure that any changes to global consent management (specifically `LBGAnalytics.privacy.decodeCookie()`) are tracked and documented.
  - Regularly review mapping keys to confirm they remain aligned with the Google Adwords tag requirements.

- **Ownership:**  
  - Assign a team member responsible for monitoring changes in both the Tealium iQ platform and Google Adwords specifications.
  - Maintain version control on this extension code to record updates and modifications.

- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Perform testing in both consent and no-consent environments to ensure that the mapping object is correctly modified.
  - Use staging environments before deploying updates to production.
  - Monitor tag performance and data integrity post-deployment, especially with regards to how changes in the mapping affect downstream analytics.

- **Change Management:**  
  - Document any modifications to the mapping, detailing why changes were made and how they impact other extensions.
  - Coordinate changes with other team members to prevent conflicts in tag implementations and ensure consistent behaviour across all Google DoubleClick tags.
