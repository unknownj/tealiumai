# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: Cardnet Webchat

## 1. Extension Overview
- **Name**: Cardnet Webchat
- **ID**: 100036
- **Type**: Javascript Code
- **Scope**: Before Load Rules
- **Execution Frequency**: Run Always

### Summary
The **Cardnet Webchat** extension is designed to modify the webchat platform being used based on specific conditions. It checks if the current domain or path corresponds to Cardnet, and if so, it overrides the webchat platform setting in the data layer to "Cardnet". This ensures that users on Cardnet's payment pages will receive the appropriate webchat support while interacting with the website.

## 2. Code Explanation
### Key Variables
- **a**: Represents the `eventType` which indicates the type of event triggering this extension.
- **b**: Represents the `eventPayload`, an object containing event-specific data.

### Logic Flow
1. **Domain Check**: The first conditional checks if the `CanonicalDomainProd` property in the `b` object contains the substring "cardnet". If true, it sets the property `WebchatPlatformOverride` to "Cardnet".
  
   ```javascript
   if(b.CanonicalDomainProd.indexOf("cardnet") >= 0){
       b.WebchatPlatformOverride = "Cardnet";
   }
   ```
   
2. **Path Check**: The second conditional checks if the current URL's pathname begins with "/business/take-payments-with-cardnet". If true, it again sets the `WebchatPlatformOverride` to "Cardnet".
  
   ```javascript
   if(window.location.pathname.indexOf("/business/take-payments-with-cardnet") === 0){
       b.WebchatPlatformOverride = "Cardnet";
   }
   ```

### Dependencies
- The code relies on the global `window` object for accessing the current URL's pathname.
- It expects `eventType` and `eventPayload` to be available, which are guaranteed as stated in the requirements.

## 3. Usage Examples
### Normal Conditions
- **Scenario**: User navigates to `https://www.cardnet.com/business/take-payments-with-cardnet`.
  - **Result**: The `WebchatPlatformOverride` in the `eventPayload` will be set to "Cardnet".

### Edge Conditions
- **Scenario**: User is on a different subdomain, e.g., `https://www.otherdomain.com`.
  - **Result**: Neither condition is satisfied, so `WebchatPlatformOverride` remains unchanged.
  
- **Scenario**: User visits `https://www.cardnet.com`.
  - **Result**: The first condition is satisfied, so `WebchatPlatformOverride` is set to "Cardnet".
  
## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas
- The extension may not work as intended if `CanonicalDomainProd` is not properly set or initialized before this extension runs.
- If there are other extensions modifying `b.WebchatPlatformOverride`, conflicts may occur, leading to unexpected behaviour.
- The pathname check is sensitive; any change in the URL structure could lead to incorrect functionality.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring
- **Defensive Checks**: Although not explicitly needed, consider adding checks for the existence of `CanonicalDomainProd` before performing operations on it to prevent potential runtime errors.
- **Code Modularity**: Consider modularising the code to separate concerns, making it easier to maintain. For example, encapsulating the logic checks into separate functions could enhance readability.
  
  Example:
  ```javascript
  function checkDomain(b) {
      if(b.CanonicalDomainProd && b.CanonicalDomainProd.indexOf("cardnet") >= 0) {
          return true;
      }
      return false;
  }
  ```

- **Meaningful Comments**: Although the code is relatively straightforward, adding inline comments explaining the purpose of each conditional could aid future developers.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes
- **Ownership**: Designate a specific team or individual for owning the extension, ensuring they are responsible for ongoing maintenance and updates.
- **Testing**: Conduct regular tests, especially following changes in the website structure or Tealium implementation to ensure continued compatibility.
- **Documentation Updates**: Ensure this documentation is reviewed and updated whenever changes are made to the extension's logic or functionality.
