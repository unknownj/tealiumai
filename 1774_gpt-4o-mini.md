# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name**: Cardnet Webchat
- **ID**: 1774
- **Type**: Javascript Code
- **Scope**: Before Load Rules
- **Execution Frequency**: Run Always

### Summary
The **Cardnet Webchat** extension is designed to control the configuration of the web chat platform based on specific conditions within the application. It checks if the user is on a specific domain or path related to Cardnet services and, if so, overrides the default value of the `WebchatPlatformOverride` variable to "Cardnet". This functionality ensures that users accessing the Cardnet payment solutions have a consistent chat experience tailored to the platform.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- `a`: Represents the `eventType` parameter which ensures the event type context is captured.
- `b`: Represents the `eventPayload` object that carries the necessary data for tracking or processing.

### Logic Flow
1. The function is immediately invoked with parameters `eventType` and `eventPayload`.
2. The first `if` statement checks if the `CanonicalDomainProd` string (a property assumed to be attached to `b`) includes "cardnet". If it does, the `WebchatPlatformOverride` property of `b` is set to "Cardnet".
3. The second `if` statement checks if the current URL's pathname starts with "/business/take-payments-with-cardnet". If this condition is also met, it again sets the `WebchatPlatformOverride` in `b` to "Cardnet".

### Dependencies
- The code relies on the existence of the `CanonicalDomainProd` property within the `eventPayload` object (`b`).
- It also uses the `window.location.pathname` global object to determine the current URL context.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Conditions
- When a user visits `https://www.example.com/business/take-payments-with-cardnet`, the extension detects the pathname, and the `WebchatPlatformOverride` will be set to "Cardnet".
- On accessing any valid Cardnet domain URL, the first condition activates, setting the override accordingly.

### Edge Conditions
- If the user navigates to a URL like `https://www.example.com/business/take-payments-with-cardnet-unknown`, the extension will **not** set the `WebchatPlatformOverride` since the pathname does not match exactly.
- If the `CanonicalDomainProd` does **not** contain "cardnet", the property will remain unaffected, which may lead to the default behaviour of the web chat being invoked.

---

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- This extension relies heavily on the specific structure of the `eventPayload`. If there are changes in the structure or naming conventions (such as `CanonicalDomainProd`), the extension might fail to set the override correctly.
- Conflicts may arise if other extensions attempt to manipulate `WebchatPlatformOverride`, leading to unexpected results. Coordination with team members on the use of this variable is advised.
- Ensure that the `eventPayload` is consistently passed through all relevant Tealium data layers to avoid undefined behaviour.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks**: While not required, consider adding checks to ensure `b.CanonicalDomainProd` is defined before evaluating its content. 
- **Modularisation**: Consider breaking this functionality into smaller functions for increased clarity and reusability. For example, separate the logic for determining the domain and pathname checks.
- **Code Style**: Maintain consistent spacing and indentation to improve readability. Use comments to explain non-obvious logic.

### Example Refactor Suggestion:

```javascript
(function(a, b) {
    function setWebchatOverride() {
        if (b.CanonicalDomainProd && b.CanonicalDomainProd.indexOf("cardnet") >= 0) {
            b.WebchatPlatformOverride = "Cardnet";
        }
        
        if (window.location.pathname.indexOf("/business/take-payments-with-cardnet") === 0) {
            b.WebchatPlatformOverride = "Cardnet";
        }
    }
    setWebchatOverride();
})(eventType, eventPayload);
```

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance**: The ownership of this extension should be designated to a specific team member or a group responsible for monitoring its performance and effects on the user experience.
- **Testing Guidelines**: Implement regression testing practices to ensure that any new changes do not affect the intended functionality. Testing should include various real-world URL paths and domain conditions.
- **Documentation Updates**: Ensure to keep this documentation current with any changes made to the extension or its dependencies, especially with updates on the broader application structure.
