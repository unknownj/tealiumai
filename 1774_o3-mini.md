# Extension Documentation: Cardnet Webchat

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the "Cardnet Webchat" Tealium iQ extension, explaining its functionality, code logic, usage examples, known limitations, and recommendations for improvement. All code examples and explanations adhere to ES5 standards.

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Cardnet Webchat
- **ID:** 1774  
- **Extension Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** Before Load Rules  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Always

**Summary:**  
The extension is designed to override the webchat platform identifier (`WebchatPlatformOverride`) in the Tealium data layer based on specific domain and URL path conditions. It checks if the current domain or the initial segment of the URL pathname contains references to "cardnet" and then sets the `WebchatPlatformOverride` variable to "Cardnet". This ensures that webchat related functionality is correctly targeted or customised for users interacting with Cardnet web pages.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables and Parameters:

- **a (eventType):** Represents the event type. Although not directly used in the current logic, it is passed as the first parameter.
- **b (eventPayload):** Acts as the data object carrying dynamic values. This object is modified to include or override `WebchatPlatformOverride` based on logic.
- **b.CanonicalDomainProd:** Expected to contain the canonical production domain as a string.
- **window.location.pathname:** The current page's URL pathname, which is examined to determine if the user is on a specific Cardnet-related page.

### Logic Flow:

1. **Domain Check:**
   - The code first checks if the `CanonicalDomainProd` property of `eventPayload` contains the substring "cardnet" (case-sensitive).
     - If found (index >= 0), it sets `b.WebchatPlatformOverride` to "Cardnet".
  
2. **Pathname Check:**
   - Independently, the code then checks if the current page’s pathname begins with "/business/take-payments-with-cardnet".
     - This is verified by using the `indexOf` method and comparing against 0 (indicating the start of the string).
     - If the condition is met, the `WebchatPlatformOverride` remains (or is reset) to "Cardnet".

### Dependencies:

- **Global Objects:**
  - `window.location`: Used for accessing and evaluating the current URL pathname.
- **Tealium Provided Objects:**
  - `eventType`: Although not used within the script logic.
  - `eventPayload` (passed as `b`): The main object manipulated by the extension.
- **ES5 Environment:**  
  - The code strictly adheres to ES5 syntax without using ES6 features.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: User on a Cardnet Domain

- **Condition:**  
  `b.CanonicalDomainProd` is set to "www.cardnet.com" (or any string containing "cardnet").
- **Behaviour:**  
  The condition in the first block will evaluate to true.  
  → `b.WebchatPlatformOverride` is set to "Cardnet".
- **Flow:**  
  The second condition is evaluated afterward. Typically, if the pathname does not start with "/business/take-payments-with-cardnet", no further changes will occur.

### Scenario 2: User on a Specific Cardnet Page

- **Condition:**  
  The current `window.location.pathname` equals "/business/take-payments-with-cardnet" or starts with that string.
- **Behaviour:**  
  The pathname condition will match (index === 0).  
  → `b.WebchatPlatformOverride` is set to "Cardnet", regardless of what `b.CanonicalDomainProd` contains.
- **Flow:**  
  This explicit check ensures that the override is enforced even if the domain check was missed or if the domain was ambiguous.

### Scenario 3: Data Flow in an Edge Case

- **Condition:**  
  Neither `b.CanonicalDomainProd` contains "cardnet" nor does the pathname start with "/business/take-payments-with-cardnet".
- **Behaviour:**  
  Neither condition is met.  
  → `b.WebchatPlatformOverride` remains undefined or retains any previously set value.
- **Flow:**  
  This is the expected behaviour when the user is not on any Cardnet-related pages.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Case Sensitivity:**
  - The string matching uses a case-sensitive check. Variations like "CardNet" or "cardNet" may not trigger the override as expected.
- **Overriding Logic Order:**
  - The override from the domain check can be inadvertently overwritten by the pathname check. However, in this implementation both checks set the same value ("Cardnet"), so no conflict occurs.
- **Conflicts with Other Extensions:**
  - If another extension manipulates `b.WebchatPlatformOverride` either before or after this extension runs, there may be unintended side effects.
  - Integration with other extensions running "Before Load Rules" could lead to timing issues or override conflicts.
- **Static String Dependency:**
  - Both conditions use hardcoded strings ("cardnet" and "/business/take-payments-with-cardnet"). Future changes in domain structure or URL patterns may require updates to this extension.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Programming Enhancements:**
  - Consider verifying that `b` and its properties (e.g., `CanonicalDomainProd`) meet expected data types before performing string operations. (Note: As per requirements, eventType and eventPayload's structure is guaranteed.)
- **Modularisation:**
  - If additional conditions or business platforms are expected in the future, extract the override logic into separate functions to improve readability and maintainability.
- **Documentation Comments:**
  - Introduce inline comments explaining the rationale behind each condition for future developers.
- **Avoiding Redundancy:**
  - Although the current logic is simple, consolidating conditions if they are expected to share similar logic in the future may improve efficiency.
- **External Configuration:**
  - Consider externalising string literals used for condition checks to a configuration object, allowing easier modifications if the criteria change.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**
  - Periodically review the URL and domain conditions to ensure they align with any changes in the Cardnet web ecosystem.
  - Maintain a changelog documenting any modifications to the business logic or string checks.
- **Ownership:**
  - Define a primary developer or team responsible for the maintenance of Tealium tags and extensions to quickly address bugs or feature changes.
- **Testing Guidelines:**
  - Test across different environments (development, staging, production) to ensure that URL pathname and domain checks evaluate correctly.
  - Automated tests should verify that `b.WebchatPlatformOverride` is correctly set under various conditions (normal, edge cases, and erroneous inputs).
- **Monitoring:**
  - Use Tealium’s logging facilities or debugging tools to monitor whether the extension is setting the `WebchatPlatformOverride` value as expected.
  - Set up alerts for unexpected variations, especially if other extensions might impact the data layer.
