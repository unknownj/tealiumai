# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation – "Yext switches"

This document provides a comprehensive guide to the "Yext switches" Tealium iQ extension. It covers an overview of the extension, detailed code explanations, usage examples, known limitations, and suggestions for refactoring and ongoing maintenance.

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Yext switches  
- **ID:** 1775  
- **Extension Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** 1525  
- **Execution Frequency:** The extension executes on every event (invoked using each tag execution where extension evaluations are required)

**Summary:**  
The "Yext switches" extension is designed to enable analytics and session tracking flags in the Yext module. It does so by detecting the presence of specific global objects – namely `ANSWERS` and `AnswersExperienceFrame` – and then setting corresponding configuration flags to true. This ensures that both analytics and session tracking functionalities are activated when the related objects are present.

---

## 2. Code Explanation

### Variables and Global Dependencies

- **ANSWERS**  
  - A global object that, when available, provides methods to manage analytics and session opt-in flags:
    - `ANSWERS.setAnalyticsOptIn(true)` – Enables analytics tracking.
    - `ANSWERS.setSessionsOptIn(true)` – Enables session tracking.

- **AnswersExperienceFrame**  
  - Another global object used for configuring the experience frame. If present, it provides a runtime configuration (`AnswersExperienceFrame.runtimeConfig`) that allows enabling:
    - Session tracking via `AnswersExperienceFrame.runtimeConfig.set("sessionTrackingEnabled", true)`
    - Analytics events via `AnswersExperienceFrame.runtimeConfig.set("analyticsEventsEnabled", true)`

### Logic Flow

1. **Self-Invoking Function:**  
   The code is wrapped inside an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) accepting three parameters:
   - `a` corresponding to `eventType`
   - `b` corresponding to `eventPayload`
   - `u` corresponding to `tagObject`

   These represent key pieces of data passed in by the Tealium runtime.

2. **Conditional Check for ANSWERS:**  
   If the global `ANSWERS` object exists:
   - The code calls `ANSWERS.setAnalyticsOptIn(true)` to enable analytics.
   - It also calls `ANSWERS.setSessionsOptIn(true)` to enable session tracking.

3. **Conditional Check for AnswersExperienceFrame:**  
   If the global `AnswersExperienceFrame` object exists:
   - The runtime configuration is updated to set `"sessionTrackingEnabled"` to true.
   - Similarly, it sets `"analyticsEventsEnabled"` to true to enable additional analytics events.

### Dependencies

- The code relies on the availability of the global objects `ANSWERS` and `AnswersExperienceFrame`.  
- It assumes that if these objects are present, they have the expected methods (`setAnalyticsOptIn`, `setSessionsOptIn`, and the configuration-setting method for `AnswersExperienceFrame.runtimeConfig`).

## 3. Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Normal Execution with Both Global Objects Present

- **Input Conditions:**
  - Both `ANSWERS` and `AnswersExperienceFrame` are defined in the global scope.
  - A standard event fires with guaranteed values for `eventType` and `eventPayload`.

- **Behaviour:**
  - The code executes and calls `ANSWERS.setAnalyticsOptIn(true)` and `ANSWERS.setSessionsOptIn(true)`.
  - Additionally, it sets `"sessionTrackingEnabled"` and `"analyticsEventsEnabled"` to true on the `AnswersExperienceFrame.runtimeConfig`.
  - Result: Both Yext analytics and session tracking are activated.

### Scenario 2: Execution with Only ANSWERS Global Object Available

- **Input Conditions:**
  - Global `ANSWERS` object exists; `AnswersExperienceFrame` is undefined.
  
- **Behaviour:**
  - Only the `ANSWERS` block of code executes, enabling analytics and session tracking related to ANSWERS.
  - No attempt is made to access `AnswersExperienceFrame`, thus preventing runtime errors.
  - Result: Yext analytics and session tracking is activated as available, limited by the ANSWERS object.

### Scenario 3: Execution with Neither Global Object Available

- **Input Conditions:**
  - Both `ANSWERS` and `AnswersExperienceFrame` are undefined.
  
- **Behaviour:**
  - Neither conditional block executes since the global objects do not exist.
  - No configuration changes occur.
  - Result: The extension does nothing, which may be acceptable if Yext functionality is not required for this event.

### Scenario 4: Edge Condition – Global Object Present without Expected Methods

- **Input Conditions:**
  - A global object (either `ANSWERS` or `AnswersExperienceFrame`) exists but does not have the expected method signatures.
  
- **Behaviour:**
  - The code attempts to call a method that may not be defined, potentially resulting in a runtime error.
  - Result: The extension behaviour might halt execution.  
*Note: This scenario requires careful handling outside the scope of this extension if such a condition is expected.*

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Dependency on Global Objects:**  
  - The extension behaviour is entirely dependent on the presence and correct implementation of `ANSWERS` and `AnswersExperienceFrame`.  
  - If these global objects are misconfigured or their API changes, the extension may fail to enable the required functionalities.

- **Lack of Defensive Checks for Methods:**  
  - The current implementation does not verify whether the expected methods exist on the global objects before invoking them. This could cause runtime errors if the objects do not implement the methods as expected.

- **Potential Conflicts:**  
  - If other Tealium iQ extensions or external scripts attempt to modify the same runtime configuration properties on `AnswersExperienceFrame` or interfere with `ANSWERS` methods, conflicts could occur.
  - Ensure that the order of execution between extensions is well-managed to avoid overwriting configuration settings inadvertently.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks:**  
  - Although the code assumes the presence of the required globals, implementing explicit checks for the existence of the expected methods could provide additional robustness.  
    *Example:*
    // if (ANSWERS && typeof ANSWERS.setAnalyticsOptIn === 'function') { ... }
  - This small change can safeguard against unexpected object shapes.

- **Code Clarity and Comments:**  
  - Add inline comments to describe the purpose of each block, especially the conditional checks. This enhances readability and maintainability.
  
- **Modularisation:**  
  - Consider extracting the feature toggles into separate functions so that additional functionality or extended logging can be incorporated easily in the future without cluttering the main execution flow.

- **Error Logging:**  
  - Ideally, incorporate logging to capture failures or issues when the expected methods are not available, which aids in debugging in production environments.

*Note:* Ensure that any refactoring stays within the ES5 standard – continue using function expressions and var declarations rather than modern ES6 features.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Testing:**  
  - Regularly test the extension in a staging environment to ensure compatibility with the global objects provided by your Yext or Answers systems.
  - Monitor runtime logs for errors that indicate potential issues with the expected methods on the global objects.

- **Ownership:**  
  - Clearly assign responsibility for this extension within your codebase documentation, so that any necessary updates or troubleshooting can be managed by the appropriate team.
  
- **Documentation Updates:**  
  - Maintain up-to-date documentation across both the extension code and any related service dependencies (e.g. changes in the ANSWERS API or AnswersExperienceFrame configuration).
  
- **Version Control:**  
  - Keep track of revisions in your version control system and include change logs, particularly when adjustments are made to accommodate updates from Yext.

- **Compatibility Checks:**  
  - Review the integration when enabling other Tealium extensions or third-party scripts to ensure that no conflicts arise. Adhere to a testing checklist especially when multiple functionality switches involve shared global configurations.

By following the above guidelines and recommendations, developers can ensure that the "Yext switches" extension remains robust, maintainable, and effective in enabling key Yext functionalities.
