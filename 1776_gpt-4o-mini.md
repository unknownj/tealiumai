# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: Target Interface Polyfill

## 1. Extension Overview
- **Name**: Target Interface Polyfill
- **ID**: 100036
- **Type**: Javascript Code
- **Scope**: Pre Loader
- **Execution Frequency**: Run Once

### Summary
The **Target Interface Polyfill** extension serves as a bridge between a web application and Adobe Target. It enables logging and handling of various events related to audience segmentation and experience targeting. By monitoring the Document Object Model (DOM) for specific elements, it triggers associated events for Adobe Target to enhance the user experience based on audience enrolments.

## 2. Code Explanation
### Key Variables and Functions
- **LBGAnalytics**: A global object used to access the functionality of the LBG Analytics platform.
- **log(eventType, eventData)**: Records events and their associated data to the `LBGAnalytics.target.events` array.
- **genericEvent(eventNumber)**: A wrapper around the built-in generic event function, sending event numbers to be processed by the tracking system.
- **setDatalayerTestIDs(activityName, experienceName)**: Updates the data layer with test identifiers for tracking.
- **fireWhenElementAvailable(selector, triggerView, forceRefire)**: A method to observe changes in the DOM, triggering events when specified elements appear or disappear.
- **targetExperienceInterface**: Contains methods for managing audience enrolments and application callbacks.

### Logic Flow
1. **Initialization**: The extension initializes `LBGAnalytics.target` to ensure that the target object exists.
2. **Event Logging**: The `log` function attempts to add event descriptors to the `LBGAnalytics.target.events` array.
3. **Element Observation**: The `fireWhenElementAvailable` function listens to the DOM for specific elements and triggers events based on their presence or absence.
4. **Audience Management**: The `targetExperienceInterface` object holds methods for setting and retrieving audience experiences, preloading audience data, and registering application callbacks, facilitating dynamic content serving.

### Dependencies
- The extension relies on the `LBGAnalytics` global object for logging and triggering events.
- It uses `MutationObserver`, a built-in JavaScript object, to monitor changes in the DOM.

## 3. Usage Examples
### Basic Element Observation
```javascript
fireWhenElementAvailable("input[name=applyAip]", "better-step-2");
fireWhenElementAvailable("input[name=imThinkingAbout]", "better-step-3");
```
### Conditional Element Observation
```javascript
if(window.location.pathname.indexOf("/personal/cwa/cwr-hub/") === 0){
    fireWhenElementAvailable("section.borrowing-options-section", "optionsVisible");
    fireWhenElementAvailable("section.explore-borrowing-options", "optionsHidden");
}
```
- **Normal Conditions**: When elements specified by the selector become available in the DOM, the associated trigger view events are fired.
- **Edge Conditions**: If the element is added or removed, the observer appropriately logs events and may refire triggers based on the `forceRefire` parameter.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas
- **Failure Handling**: The extension fails silently on errors, which may lead to difficulties in debugging. Consider adding better error handling to log failures.
- **DOM Load Timing**: If elements are added to the DOM before the observer is set up, they may not be tracked accurately unless revisited.
- **Potential Conflicts**: The extension can conflict with other scripts modifying the DOM (e.g., SPA frameworks) that could affect element visibility.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring
- **Improved Logging**: Implement verbose logging in development environments to assist with debugging.
- **Modularisation**: Break down the extension into smaller, reusable functions to enhance clarity and maintainability.
- **Error Handling Enhancements**: Instead of failing silently, log errors to a console or external logging framework for better traceability.
- **Code Consistency**: Adopt consistent naming conventions for functions and variables for improved readability.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes
- **Ownership**: Designate a responsible party for maintaining the extension over time, ensuring awareness of any updates in related Adobe Target functionalities.
- **Testing Guidelines**: Regularly validate the extension in different browsers and environments to ensure consistent behaviour.
- **Documentation Updates**: Continually update this documentation as the extension evolves and new features are added.
