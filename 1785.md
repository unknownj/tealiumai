# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: ReciteMe Feature Impressions  

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name**: ReciteMe Feature Impressions
- **ID**: 100036
- **Type**: Javascript Code
- **Scope**: Before Load Rules
- **Execution Frequency**: Run Always

### Summary
The "ReciteMe Feature Impressions" extension captures and processes user accessibility preferences stored in a browser cookie related to the ReciteMe accessibility tool. It extracts relevant data, formats it, and assigns it to the `AccessibilityImpressions` property of the event payload. This data provides insights into accessibility settings used by users, which can be leveraged for analytics and user behaviour analysis.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- **`reciteMeCookieData`**: This variable holds the decoded JSON object extracted from the `Recite.Preferences` cookie. It contains user-specific styles and settings associated with the ReciteMe tool.
  
- **`rmData`**: An object that constructs a summary of the user’s accessibility preferences, including properties like `toolbar`, `fontSize`, `fontFace`, `colorScheme`, `mask`, `ruler`, and `magnifier`.

### Logic Flow
1. The code begins by attempting to parse the `Recite.Preferences` cookie. If the cookie does not exist, the function exits early.
2. The `rmData` object is populated with various accessibility preferences derived from `reciteMeCookieData`.
3. Any properties in `rmData` that are `null` or empty strings are removed to prevent sending unnecessary data.
4. The final `rmData` object is transformed into a formatted string that prefix each property with "RECITEME/" and joins them with a semicolon.
5. The resulting string is assigned to the `AccessibilityImpressions` property of the event payload.

### Dependencies
The code relies on standard browser functionalities, including:
- The `document.cookie` API for cookie manipulation.
- Basic JavaScript functions such as `map`, `filter`, and `join` for data transformations.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Conditions
When a user has accessibility preferences set in the ReciteMe tool stored in browser cookies, the extension will:
1. Retrieve and parse those preferences.
2. Produce an output string like `RECITEME/toolbar/true; RECITEME/fontSize/125; ...`.
3. Assign the output to `b.AccessibilityImpressions`, which can then be sent to analytics.

### Edge Conditions
1. **No Cookie Present**: If the `Recite.Preferences` cookie does not exist, `reciteMeCookieData` will be `null`, and the extension will gracefully exit without altering the event payload.
   
2. **Incomplete Preference Data**: If certain properties within the cookie are not set (e.g., `font.size` is `null`), those properties will be filtered out of `rmData`, ensuring that only relevant preferences are logged.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Cookie Accessibility**: The extension relies on the presence of the `Recite.Preferences` cookie. If users clear cookies or if there are cookie-path issues, this extension will not provide any accessibility data.
  
- **Conflicts with Other Extensions**: If there are other extensions that manipulate `document.cookie`, any conflicts in cookie handling could affect the output of this extension.

- **Performance Considerations**: While this extension runs on every page load due to “Run Always” setting, if user sessions generate a high volume of cookies, it may impact performance. Monitoring and optimising cookie storage can alleviate potential slowdowns.

---

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Code Style Improvements**: To enhance readability, consider simplifying nested structures (e.g., extraction of properties) into separate helper functions. This modular approach can improve maintainability.

- **Defensive Checks**: Although eventType and eventPayload are guaranteed, it’s advisable to include checks for cookie data retrieval so that unexpected structures do not cause errors in JSON parsing. Always use try-catch blocks during JSON operations to handle potential errors gracefully.

- **Documentation of Dependencies**: Explicitly document any external dependencies on ReciteMe cookies. Business stakeholders should understand the importance of these cookies for functionalities linked to accessibility preferences.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ownership & Responsibility**: Assign a team member to periodically review and update this extension documentation, especially after changes to the ReciteMe tool or subsequent updates in user accessibility standards.

- **Testing Guidelines**: Implement unit tests for the extraction and transformation logic within the extension. Ensure to test various scenarios including presence and absence of the cookie, different user settings, and malformed cookie data.

- **Regular Audits**: Conduct regular audits of dependencies and cookie storage practices to ensure that the extension remains performant and effective in its primary function of reporting accessibility impressions.
