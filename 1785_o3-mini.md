# ReciteMe Feature Impressions – Tealium iQ Extension Documentation

This document provides an in-depth overview and explanation of the ReciteMe Feature Impressions extension for Tealium iQ. It includes details on the extension’s purpose, internal workings, usage examples, known limitations, recommendations for refactoring, and guidance on maintenance.

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** ReciteMe Feature Impressions  
- **ID:** 1785 (Extension ID: 100036)  
- **Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** Before Load Rules  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Always  

**Summary:**  
This extension extracts user interface customisation settings stored in cookies (specifically for ReciteMe preferences) and transforms these settings into a formatted string. This string is stored in the event payload under the property `AccessibilityImpressions`. The extension is designed to record which customisations (such as font size, font face, colour scheme, screen mask, ruler, and magnifier features) a user has applied, enabling further analysis or processing downstream in Tealium workflows.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables and Data Extraction

- **reciteMeCookieData:**  
  The extension first looks for a cookie named "Recite.Preferences".  
  - It splits the document cookies by “; ”, filters for the cookie that starts with "Recite.Preferences=", then extracts the value portion.
  - This value is URI-decoded and parsed from JSON into a JavaScript object.
  - If no valid cookie is found, the code exits early, ensuring no null or undefined errors occur later.

- **rmData:**  
  This object stores the transformed values from the cookie data and additional states from related cookies.  
  - **toolbar:** Set to true if a cookie value "Recite.Persist=true" is found, indicating the toolbar is active.
  - **fontSize:** If the cookie’s font size equals 100, it is considered the default and thus set to null; otherwise, the recorded font size is retained.
  - **fontFace:** Directly extracted from the cookie's settings.
  - **colorScheme:** Constructed from the combination of background colour and font colour (in the format “backgroundColor/fontColor”).
  - **mask, ruler, and magnifier:** These reflect whether the screen mask, ruler, and magnifier features are enabled respectively.

### Logic Flow

1. **Cookie Parsing & Data Extraction:**  
   The code begins by parsing the document cookies to retrieve the ReciteMe preferences. It uses a combination of array methods (`split`, `filter`, `map`) to isolate and decode the JSON string.

2. **Data Transformation:**  
   - Once the cookie data is successfully parsed into the `reciteMeCookieData` object, the extension constructs the `rmData` object.
   - Any property in `rmData` that evaluates to a falsy value (or equals "null/null") is removed from the object. This ensures that only meaningful, non-default values are used.

3. **Formatting for Output:**  
   - The remaining key-value pairs from `rmData` are then mapped into strings following the format: "RECITEME/{key}/{value}".
   - These strings are concatenated with a “;” separator and assigned to the property `AccessibilityImpressions` of the `eventPayload` object.

### Global Object Dependencies

- **document.cookie:**  
  The extension depends on the browser's global document object to access cookie data.
  
- **eventPayload:**  
  It assumes a global context where the variable `eventPayload` is available and mutable. The final formatted string is injected into this object.

- **eventType:**  
  Passed as a parameter but not used within this implementation. It is guaranteed to be present as per the extension’s operational requirements.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Valid ReciteMe Cookie Present

- **Input:**  
  - A cookie "Recite.Preferences" exists with valid JSON, specifying custom font face, a non-default font size (e.g., 120), background colour, and font colour.
  - Additionally, a cookie "Recite.Persist=true" is present.
  
- **Process:**  
  - The cookie is parsed and the `rmData` object is constructed with:  
    - toolbar: true  
    - fontSize: 120  
    - fontFace: (as specified)  
    - colorScheme: (combination of background and font colours)  
  - Any properties that are not truthy are removed.
  
- **Output:**  
  `eventPayload.AccessibilityImpressions` is set to a string similar to:  
  "RECITEME/toolbar/true;RECITEME/fontSize/120;RECITEME/fontFace/specified_value;RECITEME/colorScheme/backgroundColour/fontColour"

### Scenario 2: Missing ReciteMe Cookie

- **Input:**  
  - No cookie with the key "Recite.Preferences" exists.
  
- **Process:**  
  - The extension will attempt to filter out the cookie but will find no matching data.
  - The early return statement prevents further execution.
  
- **Output:**  
  No changes are made to `eventPayload.AccessibilityImpressions`.

### Scenario 3: Default Values Suppressed

- **Input:**  
  - The cookie specifies a font size of 100, which is treated as default.
  
- **Process:**  
  - The code explicitly sets `fontSize` to null when the default value (100) is detected.
  - This property is then removed from `rmData` during the filtering loop.
  
- **Output:**  
  `eventPayload.AccessibilityImpressions` does not include an entry for fontSize.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Cookie Dependency:**  
  - The extension strictly relies on the presence and correct formatting of the "Recite.Preferences" cookie. Any deviations (corrupt JSON, missing keys) may cause incomplete data extraction.
  
- **Hardcoded String Checks:**  
  - The value check for font size (i.e. 100) and the final check for "null/null" are hardcoded and may not adapt well to future changes in how default values are represented.
  
- **Global Object Usage:**  
  - The reliance on the global `document.cookie` and the assumption that `eventPayload` is mutable may lead to conflicts if other extensions are also modifying these in unpredictable ways.
  
- **Error Handling:**  
  - There is minimal error handling; any parsing errors during JSON decoding may cause the extension to silently fail due to the early return.

- **Potential Conflicts:**  
  - If another extension modifies the same cookies or the same `eventPayload.AccessibilityImpressions` property, there could be unexpected overwrites or data collisions.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Improved Error Handling:**  
  - Consider wrapping the JSON parsing in a try-catch block to handle corrupt cookie data gracefully.  
    (Note: While defensive coding for the presence of eventType or eventPayload is not required, adding error handling for JSON operations remains important.)

- **Code Modularisation:**  
  - Extract the cookie parsing and data transformation into separate helper functions. This can improve readability and maintainability.

- **Avoid Hardcoding where Possible:**  
  - Instead of checking directly for the value "100" for fontSize, document this default and consider a variable or configuration constant to represent a default value. This helps when updating the logic in the future.

- **Defensive Checks:**  
  - Although ES5 must be maintained, ensure that checking for the validity of properties inside cookie objects is robust. Validate nested properties before accessing them (e.g. reciteMeCookieData.style.font might be undefined in some scenarios).

- **Comments and Documentation:**  
  - Include inline comments to explain transformation logic and the significance of specific checks (e.g. why “null/null” is explicitly removed).

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  - Regularly verify that the cookie names and expected data structure are up-to-date with the ReciteMe service specifications.
  - Monitor any changes in the way the ReciteMe service handles defaults or stores user preferences as these may require updates in the extension logic.

- **Ownership:**  
  - Specify a maintainer or team responsible for this extension so that issues can be addressed promptly. Include contact details or a reference to a repository for version history.

- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Establish automated tests that simulate different cookie scenarios (valid data, missing data, default values) and validate that the `AccessibilityImpressions` output is as expected.
  - Test in different browsers to ensure that cookie parsing works reliably across environments.
  - Perform manual reviews when upstream changes to cookie formats or the Tealium environment are announced.

- **Documentation Updates:**  
  - Keep this documentation current with any code changes. Link this file within your project's documentation repository or within Tealium’s internal extension documentation for ease of access by developers and stakeholders.
