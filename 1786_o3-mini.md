# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: Set Click IDs for Event Stream

This document provides a detailed explanation of the "Set click IDs for event stream" Tealium iQ extension. It covers its overview, code functionality, usage scenarios, limitations, refactoring recommendations, and maintenance notes.

---

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Set click IDs for event stream  
- **Extension ID:** 100036 (extension metadata), with internal ID: 1786  
- **Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** Before Load Rules  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Always (occurrence)

**Summary:**  
This extension inspects the data layer for specific campaign click identifiers. It primarily sets the `click_id` – pulling from either Facebook’s or Google’s cookie values – and logs the event in the analytics system. Additionally, it reflects a range of other tracking parameters (such as `gbraid`, `wbraid`, `dclid`, `gclid`, `fbclid`, `ttclid`, and Rakuten variables) into the data layer, ensuring that detailed click attribution is available for downstream analytics and reporting. This is crucial for tracking campaign performance and attributing user acquisition accurately.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables and Objects

- **utag.data:**  
  The Tealium object where query parameter values (e.g. `cp._fbc`, `qp.gclid`, etc.) are stored.

- **clova3.datalayer:**  
  A custom data layer management object used to set variables. The `set` method is invoked with the target variable name, the value from `utag.data`, and a boolean flag (presumably for persistence).

- **LBGAnalytics:**  
  An external analytics logging object. If present (along with its `analyticsLog` function), it logs the source of the click ID updates.

- **Global variables eventType and eventPayload:**  
  Passed as parameters to the IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) although the code does not directly reference these parameters. Their presence is guaranteed.

### Logic Flow

1. **Initial Click ID Check:**  
   - The extension first checks if `click_id` is already defined in `clova3.datalayer`.  
   - If undefined, the code tries to set the `click_id` from either:
     - `utag.data["cp._fbc"]` (Facebook), setting `click_source` to "facebook" and logging `"fbclid > click_id"`.
     - `utag.data["qp.gclid"]` (Google), setting `click_source` to "google" and logging `"gclid > click_id"`.

2. **Additional Tracking Attributes:**  
   The code then examines several other query parameters in `utag.data` and, if available, sets corresponding variables in the custom data layer:
   - **GBRAID & WBRAID:**  
     - For `qp.gbraid` and `qp.wbraid`, sets the variables `gbraid` and `wbraid`, respectively, and logs these actions.
   - **DCLID:**  
     - Checks `qp.dclid` (possibly for YouTube or similar), sets `dclid`, and logs.
   - **GCLID and FBCID:**  
     - Sets `gclid` (again) if present for Google clicks and sets `fbclid` using `cp._fbc` for Facebook, each logged appropriately.
   - **TTCID:**  
     - Checks `qp.ttclid` and sets `ttclid` for TikTok click attribution.
   - **Rakuten Variables:**  
     - If `qp.ranMID` exists, sets `ranMID` and logs the update.
     - Nested within this check, it also sets `ranEAID` and `ranSiteID` if `qp.ranEAID` and `qp.ranSiteID` are present.
   - **Source and Additional Identifiers:**  
     - If `qp.source` is available, sets `source` in the data layer.  
     - Under the same condition, also checks for `qp.MID` and `qp.PID`, setting `MID` and `PID` accordingly along with logging.

### Dependencies

- **clova3.datalayer:**  
  Relies on this custom object’s `get` and `set` functions to manipulate the data layer.
- **utag.data:**  
  Acts as the storage for incoming data attributes with campaign parameters.
- **LBGAnalytics (optional):**  
  If available in the global scope, it provides logging functionality to track which identifiers are being set.
- **Global eventType and eventPayload variables:**  
  Passed into the IIFE, ensuring the extension integrates into the broader event-driven framework in Tealium.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Facebook Click Attribution

**Data Flow:**

1. The user arrives on the website with the campaign parameter `cp._fbc` already set in `utag.data`.
2. The extension detects that `click_id` is undefined.
3. It sets `click_id` to the value of `utag.data["cp._fbc"]` and sets `click_source` to "facebook".
4. The analytics log records `"fbclid > click_id"`.
5. Later in the code, it sets `fbclid` in the data layer and logs `"fbclid > datalayer"`.

**Edge Outcome:**  
No fallback to Google is attempted since the Facebook identifier was present.

### Scenario 2: Google Click Attribution

**Data Flow:**

1. The user arrives with `qp.gclid` present in `utag.data` and no `cp._fbc` available.
2. The extension, finding `click_id` undefined, sets it based on `qp.gclid` and assigns `click_source` as "google".
3. An analytics log entry `"gclid > click_id"` is created.
4. Later, the code again sets `gclid` in the data layer (with possible duplicate action) and logs `"gclid > datalayer"`.

**Edge Outcome:**  
If both Facebook and Google identifiers are found, Facebook takes precedence due to its order in the conditional checks.

### Scenario 3: Rakuten Campaign Parameters

**Data Flow:**

1. The URL includes campaigns parameters such as `qp.ranMID`, optionally followed by `qp.ranEAID` and `qp.ranSiteID`.
2. Upon detecting `qp.ranMID`, the extension sets `ranMID` and logs `"ranMID > datalayer"`.
3. It then checks and sets `ranEAID` and `ranSiteID` if they exist, logging each corresponding action.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Precedence Order:**  
  The extension gives precedence to the Facebook identifier (`cp._fbc`) over the Google identifier (`qp.gclid`) when setting `click_id`. Care must be taken to ensure that this ordering aligns with campaign attribution rules.

- **Duplicate Checks:**  
  The extension checks `qp.gclid` twice (once for setting `click_id` and again later for setting `gclid` in the data layer). This may result in redundant processing/logging in scenarios where `qp.gclid` is the sole available parameter.

- **Dependency on Global Objects:**  
  The functionality assumes the existence of `clova3.datalayer`, `utag.data`, and optionally `LBGAnalytics`. If any of these objects are not initialised or are overloaded by other extensions, unexpected behaviour might occur.

- **Synchronous Processing:**  
  The extension runs synchronously. Under heavy load or in high-traffic environments, setting multiple data layer variables in immediate succession may incur a processing delay.

- **Nested Conditions:**  
  Some conditions (e.g. Rakuten variables within `qp.ranMID`) require that `qp.ranMID` be present; if this grouping of parameters changes in future marketing setups, the logic might need updating.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks:**  
  Verify that global objects (such as `clova3.datalayer` and `utag.data`) exist before attempting to use their methods. Although these are expected to be present, a more robust error-checking mechanism would improve reliability in case of unexpected misconfigurations.

- **Avoid Redundant Checks:**  
  Consider refactoring to reduce repetition in checking for `qp.gclid` multiple times. Consolidate the logic to set and log the variable only once, thereby improving clarity and performance.

- **Modularisation:**  
  Break the logic into smaller helper functions (if permitted within ES5 constraints) to encapsulate the repeated patterns of "if defined, set variable and log" for each tracking parameter. This improves maintainability and readability.

- **Logging Enhancements:**  
  Introduce a centralised logging method to standardise how variables are logged to `LBGAnalytics.analyticsLog`. This reduces code duplication and makes future modifications less error-prone.

- **Code Comments:**  
  Improve inline documentation for clarity, especially around decision points where one tracking parameter is preferred over another.

- **Preserve ES5 Compatibility:**  
  Continue to use ES5 syntax (i.e. function expressions, var declarations) as required. Avoid using ES6 features such as `let`, `const`, or arrow functions.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  - Regularly review global dependencies (like `clova3.datalayer` and `utag.data`) to ensure compatibility with upstream changes in Tealium iQ or other integrated systems.  
  - Monitor the analytics logs for anomalies that might suggest new edge cases or emerging campaign parameters that need support.

- **Ownership:**  
  - Assign clear responsibility for the extension’s upkeep to a designated developer or team.  
  - Maintain a changelog within shared documentation to track adjustments as campaign requirements evolve (for example, the noted misnaming of `facebook_customer_id`).

- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Develop unit tests to simulate various data layer inputs (e.g. different combinations of campaign parameters).  
  - Conduct integration tests with live campaign data to verify that analytics logs correctly reflect updates.  
  - Ensure that any refactoring adheres strictly to ES5 standards and does not break compatibility with current environments.

- **Future Enhancements:**  
  - Consider adding configuration options to easily modify the precedence or addition of new tracking parameters without altering the core extension code.

This comprehensive documentation should assist developers and stakeholders alike in understanding, using, and maintaining the "Set click IDs for event stream" extension effectively.
