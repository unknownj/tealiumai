# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: RTIM Interface Module

## 1. Extension Overview
- **Name**: RTIM Interface Module
- **ID**: 100036
- **Type**: Javascript Code
- **Scope**: Pre Loader
- **Execution Frequency**: Run Once

### Summary
The RTIM Interface Module defines the `rtim` object within the `LBGAnalytics` namespace, which serves as a function to receive messages from journeys or pages and relay that information to Celebrus. This extension ensures a structured communication channel with downstream systems, encapsulating the necessary properties to maintain clear data transmission.

## 2. Code Explanation
### Key Variables
- **LBGAnalytics.rtim**: A namespace to hold the module's functionality. It ensures that the object is defined only when necessary to prevent overwriting.
- **celebrusObject**: A structured object that holds message properties to be sent to Celebrus. It guarantees that only valid string parameters are accepted.

### Logic Flow
1. The `rtim` object is checked for its existence and initialized if it doesn't exist.
2. The `message` function is defined to accept various parameters (either as individual arguments or as an object).
3. A `celebrusObject` is constructed, converting all optional parameters into string values if they are provided.
4. If `messageKey` is an object, it iterates through its properties, only adding valid strings to the `celebrusObject`.
5. The final `celebrusObject` is sent to the `LBGAnalytics.leads.sendEvent` method for further processing.

### Dependencies
- The code references `LBGAnalytics.leads.sendEvent`, which is assumed to be another existing method within the `LBGAnalytics` JavaScript object. This must be defined elsewhere in the codebase.

## 3. Usage Examples
### Normal Conditions
- **Sending a message with individual parameters**:
    ```javascript
    LBGAnalytics.rtim.message("messageKey", "responseName", "interactionPoint", "contentKey", "mboxId", "messagePathId");
    ```
- **Sending a message with an object**:
    ```javascript
    LBGAnalytics.rtim.message({
      messagekey: "messageKey",
      response: "responseName",
      inp: "interactionPoint",
      contentkey: "contentKey",
      mboxid: "mboxId",
      messagePathId: "messagePathId"
    });
    ```

### Edge Conditions
- **Passing an object with missing or invalid properties**:
    ```javascript
    LBGAnalytics.rtim.message({
      messagekey: "validKey",
      response: 1234, // Invalid: Not a string
      inp: "interactionPoint"
    });
    ```
    In this case, `response` would be ignored while `messagekey` and `inp` would be included in `celebrusObject`.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas
- If an invalid type (non-string) is provided for any keys except `messageKey`, those keys will not be included in the resulting `celebrusObject`.
- The extension may not handle cases where an unsupported data type (like arrays or objects with nested structures) is passed, which may lead to unexpected behaviour.
- Ensure that any external systems that rely on the `celebrusObject` are thoroughly documented to prevent miscommunication.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring
- **Modularisation**: Consider breaking down the `message` function into smaller sub-functions. For example, a separate validation function could refine the object structure before sending it.
- **Code Style**: Maintain consistent use of quotes (single vs double) and indentation for readability. 
- **Comments**: Enhance comments further to describe each segment of the code more explicitly for future maintainers.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes
- Regularly check for updates to the `LBGAnalytics` object to ensure compatibility.
- Establish a testing strategy to validate the input and expected output of the `message` function.
- Ownership should be assigned to a team member to ensure accountability for updates and documentation.
