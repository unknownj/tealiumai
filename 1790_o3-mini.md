# RTIM Interface Module Extension Documentation

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** RTIM Interface Module  
- **Extension ID:** 100036 (Tealium iQ) / 1790 (internal id)  
- **Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** Pre Loader  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Once  

**Summary:**  
This extension enhances the LBGAnalytics object by introducing an RTIM interface module. Its primary function is to enable the transmission of messages originating from various user journeys or web pages to the Celebrus system. The extension creates a standardised object, ensuring that only specific properties with string values are passed forward. This guarantees a predictable interface between the data source and the downstream system that handles event tracking via `utag.track`.

---

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables and Objects

- **LBGAnalytics.rtim:**  
  Ensures that the `rtim` property exists on the global LBGAnalytics object. If it does not exist, an empty object is created.

- **celebrusObject:**  
  A standardised object containing the following string properties:  
  - `messagekey`  
  - `response`  
  - `inp`  
  - `contentkey`  
  - `mboxid`  
  - `messagePathId`

### Function Logic Flow

1. **Definition of the RTIM Module:**  
   The module is attached to the LBGAnalytics global object. It creates an `rtim` namespace if one does not already exist.

2. **Message Processing Function (`LBGAnalytics.rtim.message`):**  
   This function accepts parameters that can be provided either as individual string arguments or as an object.  
   - **Input Parameters:**  
     - Primarily expects a `messageKey` string, but can also accept an object that maps to the required properties.
     - Optional parameters: `responseName`, `interactionPoint`, `contentKey`, `mboxId`, `messagePathId`.

3. **Creation of celebrusObject:**  
   - An object named `celebrusObject` is initialised with predetermined keys.  
   - Each key is assigned a value only if the corresponding parameter is of type string; otherwise, it is set to `undefined`.

4. **Object Input Handling:**  
   - If the first parameter (`messageKey`) is an object, the function iterates through each property.
   - For every property that matches one of the keys present on the `celebrusObject`, it checks that its value is a string before updating the corresponding property in `celebrusObject`.

5. **Event Triggering:**  
   - Once the `celebrusObject` is prepared, it is wrapped inside an array and passed to the `LBGAnalytics.leads.sendEvent` method, which is responsible for triggering a `utag.track` event.

### Dependencies

- **Global Objects Required:**  
  - `LBGAnalytics`: The implementation assumes that this global object exists, with at least the following properties/methods:  
    - `rtim`: For the RTIM interface.
    - `leads.sendEvent`: A method to forward the constructed message to the tracking system.
  
- **External Systems:**  
  - **Celebrus:** The downstream system which expects messages in a specific format.
  
- **Note:**  
  The code follows ES5 standards and does not use any ES6 features.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Example 1: Using Individual Parameters

```javascript
// Send a message with separate parameters for each required field.
LBGAnalytics.rtim.message("messageKey", "responseName", "interactionPoint", "contentKey", "mboxId", "messagePathId");
```

**Data Flow:**  
- The string "messageKey" is assigned to `messagekey` in the celebrusObject.
- Similarly, all other parameters are mapped accordingly.
- The `celebrusObject` is then passed on to the `LBGAnalytics.leads.sendEvent` function.

### Example 2: Using an Object as Parameter

```javascript
// Send a message where properties are provided in an object.
LBGAnalytics.rtim.message({
  messagekey: "messageKey",
  response: "responseName",
  inp: "interactionPoint",
  contentkey: "contentKey",
  mboxid: "mboxId",
  messagePathId: "messagePathId"
});
```

**Data Flow:**  
- The function inspects the provided object and maps properties that match the allowed keys.
- Only properties with string values will override the initial `undefined` settings in the celebrusObject.
- The final celebrusObject is then forwarded to trigger the `utag.track` event via the call to `LBGAnalytics.leads.sendEvent`.

### Edge Cases

- **Non-String Values:**  
  If any non-string values are passed (either individually or via the object), the corresponding property will be set to `undefined` in the celebrusObject.
  
- **Extra Properties on Object:**  
  Any properties passed in the object that do not match the predefined keys (‘messagekey’, ‘response’, ‘inp’, ‘contentkey’, ‘mboxid’, `messagePathId`) are ignored.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Data Type Validation:**  
  - The extension only accepts strings. Any deviation (e.g. numbers, booleans, or objects for a given property) results in an `undefined` value in the celebrusObject.
  
- **Reliance on Global Objects:**  
  - The functionality depends on the existence and correct initialisation of `LBGAnalytics` and `LBGAnalytics.leads.sendEvent`. If these are not present or are overwritten elsewhere in the system, the extension will fail to function as expected.

- **Limited Error Handling:**  
  - There is minimal error handling. The function silently omits properties that do not match or are not strings. This makes debugging challenging if consumers of the extension inadvertently pass invalid data.

- **Interaction with Other Extensions:**  
  - Conflicts can arise in scenarios where multiple extensions manipulate or use the same `LBGAnalytics` namespace. Order of execution and namespace pollution are potential risks.

---

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Modularisation:**  
  - Consider breaking the functionality into smaller, testable functions. For instance, isolating the creation of the celebrusObject and validation of input types.

- **Enhanced Validation:**  
  - Introduce more robust validation and error logging to ensure that if input parameters are not as expected, a warning is issued. This could assist in debugging data flow issues.

- **Defensive Programming:**  
  - While it is assumed that `eventType` or `eventPayload` exist elsewhere in your system, adding validations (even simple logging) when such assumptions do not hold can help with future troubleshooting.
  
- **Code Style:**  
  - Adhere to consistent code formatting practices. Clearly comment sections of the logic that handle type conversion and property merging.
  
- **Avoid Overwriting:**  
  - Prevent accidental overwrites within the `LBGAnalytics` object by ensuring the extension first checks if a property is already defined before assignment.

_Note:_ Ensure that the refactoring suggestions remain ES5-compliant. Do not include ES6 style improvements such as arrow functions or let/const.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

### Ongoing Maintenance

- **Ownership:**  
  - Assign a team or individual responsible for maintaining the `LBGAnalytics` module and its associated extensions. Establish a versioning system for future updates.

- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Unit tests should target the message function and verify that:
    - Valid string inputs populate the celebrusObject as expected.
    - Object parameters merge correctly with default values.
    - Non-string types result in `undefined` being assigned.
  - Integration tests should be in place to ensure interactions with the `LBGAnalytics.leads.sendEvent` are correctly triggering downstream events.

- **Documentation Updates:**  
  - Ensure that any changes in the property definitions for the celebrusObject are updated in the documentation. Maintain a changelog for clarity.

### Additional Considerations

- **Performance:**  
  - Although this extension is designed to run just once, monitor the performance impact on the overall page load if additional logic is later appended.

- **Security:**  
  - Validate and sanitise inputs if there's any possibility of user-controlled data being passed to this extension. Even though only strings are accepted, be mindful of injection risks.

- **Compatibility:**  
  - Since the module is ES5 compliant, it should work in older browsers. Nonetheless, perform cross-browser testing, particularly if your analytics code interacts with newer browser APIs elsewhere.
