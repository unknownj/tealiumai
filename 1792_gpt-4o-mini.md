# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: CBO Webchat Override

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name**: CBO Webchat Override
- **ID**: 100036
- **Type**: Javascript Code
- **Scope**: Before Load Rules
- **Execution Frequency**: Run Always

### Summary
The "CBO Webchat Override" extension is designed to manage the behaviour of a web chat platform based on specific conditions pertaining to the domain and the user's environment. It sets the `WebchatPlatformOverride` variable to alter the platform behaviour for different scenarios, hence improving user experience and integration quality across varying conditions.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- **a**: Represents the event type, which is expected to be passed to the function.
- **b**: Represents the event payload, which is an object used for storing and relaying information regarding the event.

### Logic Flow
1. **Domain Checks**: The extension checks if the `CanonicalDomainProd` contains specific strings ("cbonline", "cbsecure", or "clublloyds.com"). If any of these conditions are met and the script is not running in a top frame (`window.top !== window`), it sets `WebchatPlatformOverride` to "Other".
  
2. **Pathname Check**: It verifies whether the pathname of the current URL includes "/mortgages/landing/". If true, it also sets `WebchatPlatformOverride` to "Other".

3. **Browser Check**: The script checks if the user's browser is Internet Explorer 11 by inspecting the user agent string for "trident/7". If this condition is met, it overrides the platform to "IE11".

4. **Error Handling**: Any errors encountered while checking the user agent are caught silently, ensuring they do not disrupt the execution of the extension.

### Dependencies
- **Global Objects**: The extension relies on the global objects `window`, `navigator`, and the `eventPayload` object. No external libraries are required.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Typical Use Case
- When a user visits `https://www.cbonline.com`, the extension detects the domain and checks that itâ€™s not in a top frame. Consequently, `WebchatPlatformOverride` is set to "Other".

### Scenario 2: Pathname Condition
- If a user navigates to `https://www.example.com/mortgages/landing/`, regardless of the domain, the extension modifies `WebchatPlatformOverride` to "Other".

### Scenario 3: Browser Specific Handling
- For a user on Internet Explorer 11 visiting any page, the check on the user agent results in `WebchatPlatformOverride` being set to "IE11".

### Edge Condition
- If the user visits a domain not specified in the extension, or a pathname that does not match the criteria, `WebchatPlatformOverride` remains unchanged.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Silent Failures**: Errors in checking the user agent are caught but not logged, which may hinder troubleshooting.
- **Frame Restrictions**: Running this script in certain iframe contexts may lead to unexpected results since checks depend on `window.top`.
- **Non-overriding cases**: If none of the conditions match, `WebchatPlatformOverride` will not be set, which may lead to inconsistencies with how the chat operates.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Code Clarity**: Consider adding comments throughout the code for clarity about each conditional block, even though this is for internal use.
- **Modular Code**: While supporting ES5, consider breaking the logic into smaller, well-named functions to promote reusability and readability.
- **Logging**: Introduce logs for error handling, especially for user agent checks to facilitate easier debugging in case of issues.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ownership**: This extension should be maintained by the team responsible for webchat functionalities.
- **Testing Guidelines**: Implement unit tests for various conditions to ensure expected behaviour across different scenarios, especially when changes are introduced.
- **Ongoing Maintenance**: Regularly review the extension against updates in domain structures or chat platform changes to ensure it continues to function effectively.

Ensure that all developers working with this extension understand its functionality and follow the proposed refactor recommendations to keep the code efficient and maintainable.
