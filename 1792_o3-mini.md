# CBO Webchat Override Extension Documentation

---

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** CBO Webchat Override  
- **ID:** 1792  
- **Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** Before Load Rules  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Always  

**Summary:**  
This extension is designed to set the value of the global variable "WebchatPlatformOverride" based on the current environment and URL conditions. It primarily checks domain names and URL paths to determine if a user is on a specific part of the site or using a particular browser version (such as IE11). The extension applies overrides when the conditions match, effectively guiding the chat platform to alter its behavior based on context. This is important for ensuring that the correct chat support logic is applied across different environments and browsers.

## 2. Code Explanation

**Key Variables and Parameters:**

- **a:** Represents the `eventType`. Although it is not directly used inside the function, it is passed as the first argument.  
- **b:** Represents the `eventPayload` object. This is the primary object that holds various global properties such as `CanonicalDomainProd` and is modified by the extension.  

**Logic Flow:**

1. **Domain Checks for "cbonline" and "cbsecure":**
   - The code checks if the property `CanonicalDomainProd` (a string) contains "cbonline" or "cbsecure".  
   - If either condition is true and the current window is in an iframe (i.e. `window.top !== window`), it sets `b.WebchatPlatformOverride` to `"Other"`.
   
2. **Pathname Check:**
   - It checks whether `window.location.pathname` includes the string "/mortgages/landing/".  
   - If found, the extension sets `b.WebchatPlatformOverride` to `"Other"`, irrespective of whether it is in an iframe or not.

3. **User Agent Check for IE11:**
   - Within a try-catch block (for safe exception handling), it examines the `navigator.userAgent` after converting it to lower case.  
   - If it detects the string "trident/7" (a signature of Internet Explorer 11), it sets `b.WebchatPlatformOverride` to `"IE11"`.

4. **Hostname Check for "clublloyds.com":**
   - It inspects `window.location.hostname`.  
   - If the hostname contains "clublloyds.com", it sets `b.WebchatPlatformOverride` to `"Other"`.

**Dependencies:**

- The extension relies on global objects such as `window`, `window.top`, `window.location`, and `navigator`.
- It presumes the structure of the `eventPayload` object (`b`) includes the property `CanonicalDomainProd` and is available and correctly formatted.
- No external libraries or ES2015+ features are used, ensuring ES5 compatibility throughout.

## 3. Usage Examples

**Scenario 1: Loading on a Production Environment with "cbonline" in CanonicalDomainProd**

- **Input:**  
  - `b.CanonicalDomainProd = "www.cbonline.example.com"`
  - The script is running inside an iframe (i.e. `window.top !== window`)
- **Output:**  
  - `b.WebchatPlatformOverride` is set to `"Other"`.

**Scenario 2: Loading on a Mortgage Landing Page**

- **Input:**  
  - `window.location.pathname = "/mortgages/landing/special-offer"`
- **Output:**  
  - `b.WebchatPlatformOverride` is set to `"Other"`, regardless of the environment.

**Scenario 3: Running in Internet Explorer 11**

- **Input:**  
  - `navigator.userAgent = "Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 10.0; Windows NT 6.1; Trident/7.0;)"`
- **Output:**  
  - `b.WebchatPlatformOverride` is set to `"IE11"`.
  
**Scenario 4: External Domain "clublloyds.com"**

- **Input:**  
  - `window.location.hostname = "www.clublloyds.com"`
- **Output:**  
  - `b.WebchatPlatformOverride` is set to `"Other"`.

**Edge Conditions:**

- If multiple conditions are met (for example, the URL path matches "/mortgages/landing/" and the user agent is IE11), the code executes sequentially. The final condition met in the code order will take precedence.  
- In cases where `b.WebchatPlatformOverride` is being set by multiple conditions, the overriding behaviour depends entirely on the order of execution, which may lead to unexpected overrides. Stakeholders should be aware of the order-dependent logic.

---

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Sequential Overrides:**  
  As the conditions are sequentially checked, later conditions can override previous settings of `b.WebchatPlatformOverride`. This could lead to unexpected outcomes if multiple conditions are true simultaneously.

- **Iframe Dependency:**  
  For certain conditions (e.g. "cbonline" and "cbsecure" checks), the override only applies if the instance is running within an iframe. If there is a change in how iframes are handled or nested, the logic might behave differently.

- **Browser Detection Accuracy:**  
  The IE11 detection is solely based on the presence of "trident/7" in the user agent string. While this is a common approach, any updates or modifications to how IE11 reports its user agent might reduce the accuracy.

- **Interplay with Other Extensions:**  
  If other Tealium extensions modify the same `eventPayload` properties (especially `WebchatPlatformOverride`), conflicts may arise. Clear documentation of execution order and dependencies between extensions is advised.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Explicit Code Order:**  
  Consider reordering or grouping conditions to ensure the intended precedence. For example, if the IE11 override should take precedence over other conditions, it could be moved earlier in the function or explicitly check for conflicts.

- **Modularisation:**  
  Although the ES5 restrictions preclude the use of modern syntax, the code can still be modularised. Splitting the conditions into smaller, separately named functions (within the confines of ES5) could improve readability and easing future changes.
  
  Example (conceptual, using only ES5 syntax):
  var applyIEMatch = function(payload) {  
      try {  
          if (window.navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase().indexOf("trident/7") >= 0) {  
              payload.WebchatPlatformOverride = "IE11";  
          }  
      } catch (e) {  
          // fail gracefully  
      }  
  };

- **Comments and Documentation Lines:**  
  Increasing inline comments to explain why certain conditions are checked would help other developers understand the intended business reasons behind each check.  
   
- **Defensive Assignment Order:**  
  Even though `eventType` and `eventPayload` are guaranteed to exist, consider checking the integrity of properties like `CanonicalDomainProd` to avoid errors if upstream changes alter the structure.

- **Condition Isolation:**  
  Review whether conditions should be isolated or handled collectively, especially if future requirements prompt further differentiation between environments.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Regular Reviews:**  
  Regularly review the extension logic especially when there are changes to the website architecture, user agent string formats, or domain naming conventions.  
   
- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  Ensure comprehensive testing scenarios across different environments (iframe vs. non-iframe), domain names, paths, and browsers. A dedicated testing matrix should exercise each condition individually and in combination.

- **Ownership:**  
  Document the owner or the team responsible for this extension. Assign periodic review tasks to ensure compatibility with any changes in the operating environment or supporting platforms.

- **Logging & Monitoring Enhancements:**  
  While not currently implemented, consider adding logging (compatible with ES5) during development phases to track which conditions are being met. This could help diagnose issues if customers report unexpected behaviours.

- **Backward Compatibility:**  
  Maintain ES5 compliance throughout refactoring to ensure compatibility with environments that have not yet upgraded to newer JavaScript standards.
