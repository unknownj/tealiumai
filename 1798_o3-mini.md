# Firestore ID Lookup Payload Unpack Extension Documentation

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name**: Firestore ID lookup payload unpack  
- **Extension ID**: 1798  
- **Extension Type**: Javascript Code  
- **Scope**: After Load Rules  
- **Execution Frequency (Occurrence)**: Run Always  

**Summary**:  
This extension is specifically mapped to all of the Google DoubleClick tags. Its main responsibilities are:  
1. To check if the DC_target (or DC_IDs in the code) datalayer variable is populated. If the variable is not populated, the tag firing is aborted.  
2. To unpack a delimited string from the DC_target into its constituent parts. If the string contains two parts (separated by a "!"), it maps them to DC_src and DC_act. The values are then merged into the event payload and set into the Tealium and custom clova3 datalayer for consumption by the collect tag.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Global Objects and Dependencies

- **Global Variables**:  
  - **b**: Represents the event payload object. It must include a property `DC_IDs` containing the delimited ID string.
  - **utag.data**: Tealium data layer where DC values are pushed.
  - **clova3.datalayer**: A custom data layer used to set the DC values for further processing.
  - **eventType** and **eventPayload**: Passed into the function, but the extension is guaranteed to have them available as per the deployment requirements.

### Key Variables and Functions

1. **Function: checkDcIDs()**
   - **Purpose**:  
     - Checks if the global variable `b.DC_IDs` is populated or if it has a value of 0.
   - **Logic**:
     - If `b.DC_IDs` is falsy or equals 0, it returns `false`â€”causing the extension to abort further execution.
     - If valid, it returns `true`.

2. **Function: unpackDc(dcValues)**
   - **Purpose**:  
     - Splits the incoming `DC_target` string using the delimiter "!".
   - **Input & Output**:
     - Accepts a string (`dcValues`).
     - Returns an array (`dcArray`) containing the split values.

3. **Function: createActObj(arr)**
   - **Purpose**:  
     - Creates an object mapping the first element of the array to `DC_src` and the second element to `DC_act`.
   - **Input & Output**:
     - Accepts an array (`arr`) with at least two elements.
     - Returns an object with the keys:
       - `DC_src` (set to arr[0])
       - `DC_act` (set to arr[1])

### Logic Flow

1. **Initial Variable Validation**:
   - The flag is set by calling `checkDcIDs()`, which validates the existence of `b.DC_IDs`.
   - If the flag is `false`, execution stops and the extension returns `false`.

2. **Processing the DC_target (DC_IDs) String**:
   - The string from `b.DC_IDs` is split into an array (`dcValues`) using `unpackDc()`.
   - Only arrays with a length of 2 are processed. If true, the values are passed to `createActObj()` and mapped to `DC_src` and `DC_act`.

3. **Merging and Setting Data**:
   - The resulting object (`dcObject`) is merged back into the event payload object (`b`), overwriting any pre-existing values for `DC_src` if present.
   - The values are also set in:
     - `utag.data` for Tealium collect tag recognition.
     - `clova3.datalayer` using the `set` method, with the third parameter (true) possibly ensuring persistence or immediate update.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Scenario

**Input Data**:
- `b.DC_IDs` contains the string "sourceValue!actionValue".

**Processing**:
1. `checkDcIDs()` confirms `b.DC_IDs` is populated.
2. `unpackDc("sourceValue!actionValue")` splits the string to form:  
   `[ "sourceValue", "actionValue" ]`
3. `createActObj()` then maps the array:
   - `DC_src` becomes "sourceValue"
   - `DC_act` becomes "actionValue"

**Result**:
- The event payload (`b`) is updated:
  - `b.DC_src = "sourceValue"`
  - `b.DC_act = "actionValue"`
- `utag.data` and `clova3.datalayer` receive the mapped values accordingly.

### Edge Conditions

1. **Missing DC_IDs**:
   - If `b.DC_IDs` is not defined or is set to 0:
     - `checkDcIDs()` returns `false`.
     - The extension aborts execution by returning `false` without processing any further logic.

2. **Invalid Format in DC_IDs**:
   - If `b.DC_IDs` does not include the "!" delimiter or leads to an array with a length other than 2:
     - The `dcObject` is not populated.
     - No mapping is done and the event payload remains unchanged for the DC keys.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Assumption of Format**:  
  - The code assumes that a valid `DC_IDs` string, when populated, will always have exactly one "!" leading to an array of exactly two values. If the string format deviates, the mapping will not occur.

- **Global Dependencies**:  
  - The extension relies on external objects such as `utag.data` and `clova3.datalayer`. If these globals are not available or are redefined elsewhere on the page, the extension might fail or behave unexpectedly.

- **Overwriting Values**:  
  - If the event payload (`b`) already contains a `DC_src` property before merging, it will be overwritten without warning.

- **Limited Fallback**:  
  - There is no fallback mechanism if the expected structure of `DC_IDs` is not met beyond simply not mapping the values at all.

- **Script Order Sensitivity**:  
  - This extension should run after all previous load rules have ensured that the necessary global variables are available and correctly populated.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Modularisation of Functions**:  
  - Consider breaking down the logic into smaller helper methods or even external libraries if similar processing logic is needed elsewhere.

- **Enhanced Validation**:  
  - While defensive coding for `eventType` and `eventPayload` is not needed, additional validation of the format of `DC_IDs` can be useful. For example, checking the length of the resulting array and perhaps logging a warning if an unexpected format is encountered.

- **Comments and Code Clarity**:  
  - Maintain clear comments for each function to help future maintainers quickly understand the purpose and usage of the functions.
  
- **Error Logging**:  
  - It might be useful to incorporate error logging (or a debug flag) to log cases where the format of `DC_IDs` is not as expected, rather than silently aborting the operation.

- **Separation of Concerns**:  
  - Instead of merging values directly into the event payload (`b`), consider returning a result object and then merging that into `b` in a centralised manner. This can help maintain clarity in larger implementations.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ownership**:  
  - Clearly identify the developer or team responsible for updating this extension. Include contact information or documentation links in internal comments if necessary.

- **Testing Guidelines**:  
  - Create unit tests to simulate supported and edge cases. These might include:
    - Valid `DC_IDs` strings.
    - Null, undefined, or zero values for `DC_IDs`.
    - Unexpected formats (e.g., strings that do not contain the delimiter).
  - These tests will ensure that future changes do not break the extension logic.

- **Documentation Updates**:  
  - Maintain this documentation as part of the change log. When refactoring or updating the logic, update the documentation to reflect new dependencies, logic flows, or error handling strategies.

- **Code Reviews**:  
  - Ensure that any future modifications are peer-reviewed to maintain consistency with maintenance guidelines and to ensure compatibility with Tealium iQ and other related extensions.

- **Version Control**:  
  - Use version control tags in your code comments or repository to reference which version of the extension this documentation applies to.
