# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: MAU – Put Values into Arrays for the Tag

This document provides comprehensive information on the Tealium iQ extension code titled "MAU: put values into arrays for the tag". The extension is designed to transfer event data into specific arrays within the tag object, ensuring that the downstream tag processes the values correctly.

---

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** MAU: put values into arrays for the tag  
- **Extension ID:** 1809  
- **Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** 1550,1611  
- **Execution Frequency:** Executes each time the extension is triggered (typically on tag load or during event processing)

**Summary:**  
This extension takes selected properties from the event payload (such as "JourneyProduct", "JourneyName", "Brand", "ProductGroup", and "JourneyAmount") and assigns them to arrays within the tag object. It further ensures that the tag is provided with numerical and string values in the expected format (arrays for product data and numeric or string values for order details) to avoid errors when processing tag data. The extension also handles a conditional logic for the "order_subtotal" field based on the value of "JourneyAmount".

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables and Parameters

- **a (eventType):**  
  Passed into the function as `a`. Although provided, it is not used within the extension code.

- **b (eventPayload):**  
  The event payload object contains properties including:
  - "JourneyProduct"
  - "JourneyName"
  - "Brand"
  - "ProductGroup"
  - "JourneyAmount"

- **u (tagObject):**  
  The tag object that carries or utilises the collected data. The code expects that its properties (e.g. `data.product_id`, `data.product_name`, etc.) are already initialised as arrays (or set to receive values).

### Logic Flow

1. **Populating Arrays:**  
   The extension pushes values into various arrays in `u.data`:
   - `u.data.product_id` receives `b["JourneyProduct"]`
   - `u.data.product_name` receives `b["JourneyName"]`
   - `u.data.product_brand` receives `b["Brand"]`
   - `u.data.product_category` receives `b["ProductGroup"]`
   - `u.data.product_quantity` receives a default value of `1`

   *Note:* This ensures values are added into arrays, as the downstream tag does not accept singular string values.

2. **Conditional Subtotal Assignment:**  
   The logic checks the "JourneyAmount" property:
   - If `b["JourneyAmount"]` is less than or equal to `0`, then `u.data.order_subtotal` is set to that value.
   - Otherwise, `u.data.order_subtotal` is assigned the value `1`.

3. **Setting Additional Variables:**  
   - `u.data.order_currency` is set to the static string `"GBP"`, ensuring currency is always included.

### Dependencies and Global Objects

- The extension depends on the standard Tealium objects passed into it: `eventType`, `eventPayload`, and `tagObject`.
- There are no external libraries or global objects explicitly imported or referenced.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Example 1: Normal Scenario

**Input Event Payload (b):**
- JourneyProduct: "12345"
- JourneyName: "WidgetA"
- Brand: "Acme"
- ProductGroup: "Widgets"
- JourneyAmount: 50

**Expected Outcome:**
- `u.data.product_id` will have "12345" appended.
- `u.data.product_name` will have "WidgetA" appended.
- `u.data.product_brand` will have "Acme" appended.
- `u.data.product_category` will have "Widgets" appended.
- `u.data.product_quantity` will have `1` appended.
- Because `JourneyAmount` (50) is greater than 0, `u.data.order_subtotal` is set to `1`.
- `u.data.order_currency` is set to `"GBP"`.

### Example 2: Edge Case – Negative or Zero JourneyAmount

**Input Event Payload (b):**
- JourneyProduct: "67890"
- JourneyName: "WidgetB"
- Brand: "Beta"
- ProductGroup: "Gadgets"
- JourneyAmount: 0

**Expected Outcome:**
- All product-related arrays will have the corresponding data appended as per the normal scenario.
- Since `JourneyAmount` is `0` (<= 0), `u.data.order_subtotal` is set to `0` (retaining the passed negative or zero value).
- Currency remains set to `"GBP"`.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Array Initialisation:**  
  It is assumed that the `u.data` properties (`product_id`, `product_name`, `product_brand`, `product_category`, and `product_quantity`) are already defined and initialised as arrays. If not, the push operations may lead to errors.

- **Conditional Logic on JourneyAmount:**  
  The conditional checks if `JourneyAmount` is less than or equal to zero, and assigns that value directly, which could be unexpected if a zero or negative value is not intended for the order subtotal.

- **Coupling with Other Extensions:**  
  If other extensions modify the same `u.data` properties or expect them to be in a different format, conflicts might occur if execution order is not carefully managed.

- **Lack of Field Existence Checks:**  
  The code assumes that properties (e.g., `b["JourneyAmount"]`) exist. Although the input objects are guaranteed as per the requirement, missing or unexpected properties could cause unintended behaviour.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Coding for Arrays:**  
  Although not mandatory to check for the presence of `eventType` or `eventPayload`, consider verifying that each data array exists before attempting to push values. Example:
  - If `u.data.product_id` is not an array, initialise it with `u.data.product_id = u.data.product_id || [];`

- **Modularise Similar Operations:**  
  If additional product attributes are added later, you might benefit from refactoring the code to iterate over a list of keys rather than repeating the push operations.

- **Clarify Business Logic:**  
  Consider documenting or refactoring the conditional logic regarding `JourneyAmount` so that it is clear why a non-positive amount is assigned directly while a positive value defaults to `1`.

- **Code Comments & Readability:**  
  Maintain or expand inline comments to help future developers understand the reasoning behind the conditional assignment and static values such as `"GBP"`.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Testing:**  
  Regularly test the extension with various scenarios including edge cases (e.g., missing or unexpected values in `eventPayload`) to ensure that the tag always receives correctly formatted data.

- **Ownership and Documentation:**  
  Keep this documentation up-to-date with any changes to the code. Involve the team managing Tealium implementations to ensure that any changes to the data layer are reflected in the extension code.

- **Version Control & Change Log:**  
  Use version control to maintain a changelog for the extension. Document every change related to the logic, input expectations, or output format updates.

- **Collaboration with Analytics and Tag Management Teams:**  
  Collaborate with stakeholders to ensure that any refactoring does not conflict with other tagging setups or extensions.
