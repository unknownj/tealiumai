# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: Show Hide 23

## 1. Extension Overview
- **Name**: Show Hide 23
- **ID**: 1812
- **Type**: Javascript Code
- **Scope**: After Tag Extensions
- **Execution Frequency**: Run Once

### Summary
The "Show Hide 23" extension dynamically loads a script to manage the display of elements on a webpage based on specific data attributes (`data-show-elements` and `data-hide-elements`). It determines which elements should be shown or hidden by observing changes to the DOM and sending relevant events to LBG Analytics when such changes occur. This allows for a responsive user interface that adapts based on user interactions and page state.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- **`shId`**: A unique identifier derived from the hostname and pathname of the current URL. This ensures that each page generates a unique ID.
- **`shEndpoint`**: The URL from which the external script for Show/Hide logic is loaded.
- **`shScript`**: A `<script>` element dynamically created to load the script from `shEndpoint`.

### Logic Flow
1. The extension uses the `LBGAnalytics.doSoon` method to ensure code execution after the DOM is ready.
2. It checks if there are any elements with the attributes `data-show-elements` or `data-hide-elements`.
3. If such elements exist, it sets up a global `utag` object and prepares for a dynamic script load.
4. The external script is appended to the document after a 300ms delay.
5. Once the script loads, it calls the `LBGAnalytics.dleShowHide` function, passing in any relevant data.
6. Within `LBGAnalytics.dleShowHide`, a `MutationObserver` monitors changes to the `div#main` element. 
7. When a mutation is detected, it checks if an element has changed from "hide" to visible. If so, it sends a corresponding event to LBG Analytics.

### Dependencies
- The script relies on the global `LBGAnalytics` object, particularly the `LBGAnalytics.dleShowHide` method for the main functionality.
- It depends on the presence of the `utag` global variable to manage global configurations.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Scenario
- **Use Case**: A user visits a product page where certain promotional elements should be displayed based on user interactions.
- **Data Flow**: Elements with `data-show-elements="promoBanner"` will be shown if triggered by an event, and their visibility is monitored to ensure the related analytics event is sent once displayed.

### Edge Condition
- **Error Handling**: If the script fails to load (e.g., network issues), no events will be sent for the show/hide actions, resulting in a silent failure.
- **Resolution**: Ensure the network is stable and the endpoint is accessible.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Delayed Loading**: The 300ms delay before appending the `<script>` tag could lead to a situation where element state changes occur before the script is loaded, potentially causing missed events.
- **DOM Conflicts**: If multiple scripts modify the same elements concurrently (for instance, other Tealium extensions), this may result in unexpected behaviours.
- **Observability**: The current implementation specifically monitors the `class` attribute. Changes to other attributes or styles will not trigger the observer.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks**: Consider adding checks to ensure `showHideConfig` is in the expected format before accessing its properties to avoid potential JavaScript errors.
- **Code Style**: Define key functions (`initialize`, `setupObserver`) to improve modularity and readability, separating concerns within the code.
- **Comments**: Enhance inline comments to improve clarity and maintainability for future developers.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ownership**: It is recommended to assign a dedicated team member or role for maintenance, ensuring there is someone responsible for this extension's functionality.
- **Testing Guidelines**: Regularly test the extension across multiple browsers and devices to ensure consistency. Edge cases, including rapid clicks or AJAX content loads, should be part of the testing scope.
- **Documentation Updates**: Keep this documentation up to date with any changes applied to the codebase to maintain relevance for future developers.
