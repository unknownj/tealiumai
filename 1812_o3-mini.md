# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation – "Show Hide 23"

This document provides a thorough overview and explanation of the "Show Hide 23" extension for Tealium iQ. It details the purpose, code logic, usage examples, known limitations, refactoring recommendations and maintenance guidelines.

---

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Show Hide 23  
- **ID:** 1812 (Internal Identifier), with an associated extension ID 100036  
- **Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** After Tag Extensions  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Once

**Summary:**  
This extension is designed to detect whether the current webpage contains any elements with the attributes `data-show-elements` or `data-hide-elements`. If such elements exist, it dynamically constructs and injects a remote script based on the current URL. Once the script is loaded, it subsequently invokes the `LBGAnalytics.dleShowHide` function, passing enriched configuration data linked via a generated ID. The purpose is to systematically manage the visibility of certain page elements and send corresponding analytics events based on DOM mutations.

---

## 2. Code Explanation

### 2.1 Initial Check and Script Injection

- **Trigger Condition:**  
  The code first checks if the document contains any elements with the attributes `data-show-elements` or `data-hide-elements` using a query selector:
  
  ```javascript
  if (document.querySelectorAll("[data-show-elements],[data-hide-elements]").length) {
  ```

- **Global Object Initialisation:**  
  The script ensures that the following global objects are available:
  - `window.utag`
  - `utag.globals`
  - `utag.globals.dle`
  - `utag.globals.dle.enrichments`
  
  This is to guarantee that the necessary structures exist for storing configuration data that may be referenced later.

- **Dynamic ID and Endpoint:**  
  The variable `shId` is computed by concatenating "sh_" with a sanitized version of the hostname and pathname (removing any non-alphanumeric characters). For example:
  
  ```javascript
  var shId = "sh_" + (window.location.hostname + window.location.pathname).replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9]/g, "");
  ```
  
  A remote script URL (`shEndpoint`) is then constructed using this `shId`:
  
  ```javascript
  var shEndpoint = "https://tags.tiqcdn.com/dle/lbg/main/" + shId + ".js";
  ```

- **Script Creation and Delayed Insertion:**  
  A new `<script>` element is created with the source set to the `shEndpoint`:
  
  ```javascript
  var shScript = document.createElement("script");
  shScript.src = shEndpoint;
  shScript.async = true;
  ```
  
  On the `load` event of this script, the method `LBGAnalytics.dleShowHide` is called with configuration data from `utag.globals.dle.enrichments[shId]`.

  Finally, the script injection is delayed by 300 milliseconds:
  
  ```javascript
  setTimeout(function () {
    document.body.appendChild(shScript);
  }, 300);
  ```

### 2.2 Mutation Observation and Event Triggering

- **Function Definition:**  
  The function `LBGAnalytics.dleShowHide` is defined to accept a `showHideConfig` object. This configuration should be an object containing mappings, where keys correspond to element IDs and values contain event configuration data.
  
- **Container Selection:**  
  The target container is selected via:
  
  ```javascript
  var showHideContainer = document.querySelector("div#main");
  ```
  
  Mutation observation occurs inside this container.

- **Mutation Observer Setup:**  
  An observer is configured to watch for any changes in the `class` attribute of the descendant elements:
  
  ```javascript
  var options = {
    attributes: true,
    attributeFilter: ["class"],
    attributeOldValue: true,
    subtree: true
  };
  ```
  
- **Callback Logic:**  
  The observer callback iterates over each mutation record. It checks if the previous class list (stored in `mutation.oldValue`) contained the "hide" class and if the current class list no longer includes "hide". If these conditions are met:
  
  1. It retrieves the `id` attribute of the relevant element.
  2. Looks up the corresponding configuration in `showHideConfig`.
  3. Sets a default `JourneyName` if not provided.
  4. Sends an event by invoking `LBGAnalytics.events.send` with the configuration object.
  
  The callback function is defined as:
  
  ```javascript
  var showHideCallback = function (mutationList) {
    mutationList.forEach(function (mutation) {
      if (mutation.oldValue.split(" ").indexOf("hide") >= 0) {
        if (!mutation.target.classList.contains("hide")) {
          var targetId = mutation.target.getAttribute("id");
          if (showHideConfig[targetId]) {
            if (!showHideConfig[targetId].JourneyName) showHideConfig[targetId].JourneyName = "Progressive Disclosure";
            LBGAnalytics.events.send(showHideConfig[targetId]);
          }
        }
      }
    });
  };
  ```
  
  Finally, the observer is instantiated and begins observing the target container:
  
  ```javascript
  (new MutationObserver(showHideCallback)).observe(showHideContainer, options);
  ```

### 2.3 Dependencies

- **LBGAnalytics Library:**  
  The code depends on the existence of the global object `LBGAnalytics` with methods such as:
  - `doSoon` – To schedule the operation after certain conditions (or delay).
  - `dleShowHide` – For processing and sending events based on element visibility changes.
  - `events.send` – To send the actual analytic event.

- **Tealium utag Object:**  
  The `utag` global object is utilised to store enrichment configurations under `utag.globals.dle.enrichments`. The remote script loaded dynamically is expected to contribute to these enrichment configurations.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Scenario

1. **Initial Page Load:**  
   When the page loads, if it contains elements with either `data-show-elements` or `data-hide-elements` attributes, the extension will:
   - Initialise the required global objects.
   - Construct a unique script ID (e.g., `sh_examplecomindex` for hostname "example.com" and pathname "/index").
   - Asynchronously load a remote configuration script from `https://tags.tiqcdn.com/dle/lbg/main/sh_examplecomindex.js`.

2. **After Remote Script Load:**  
   - The remote script populates `utag.globals.dle.enrichments[shId]` with configuration data.
   - The `LBGAnalytics.dleShowHide` function is invoked with this configuration.

3. **User Interaction and Element Visibility Change:**  
   - Upon a DOM mutation where an element’s classes change from containing "hide" to no longer containing "hide", the Mutation Observer triggers.
   - If the element’s `id` is found in the configuration, an analytic event is sent using `LBGAnalytics.events.send`.

### Edge Conditions

- **No Relevant Elements:**  
  If the document does not contain any elements with `data-show-elements` or `data-hide-elements`, the extension does nothing.

- **Missing Configuration Data:**  
  When the `showHideConfig` object is empty or does not include a configuration for a mutated element’s `id`, the block inside the Mutation Observer callback is skipped, and no events are sent.

- **DOM Structure Variations:**  
  If the expected container (`div#main`) is not present, the Mutation Observer will not observe any mutations. This can lead to no analytic events being triggered on class changes.

---

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Container Dependency:**  
  The code strictly expects a container with the selector "div#main". If the structure of the page changes, the Mutation Observer may not function as intended.

- **Unique ID Generation:**  
  The `shId` is generated using a simple concatenation and sanitisation method. This might lead to collisions if similar URL structures are used across different pages.

- **Delayed Script Insertion:**  
  The script appends the remote script to the DOM after a fixed delay (300ms). In situations where page loads or dynamic DOM manipulations are delayed further, there might be a timing issue.

- **External Dependencies:**  
  The extension depends on external libraries and globals (`LBGAnalytics` and `utag`). Any conflict or delay in loading these scripts can cause the extension to fail silently.

- **Non-Standard Attributes:**  
  The extension only checks for `data-show-elements` and `data-hide-elements`. If additional attributes are used to control visibility, modifications to the code will be required.

---

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive DOM Checks:**  
  Although it is acceptable to assume the availability of `eventType` and `eventPayload`, consider verifying that `document.body` exists before attempting to append a script.  
  Example:  
  ```javascript
  if (document.body) {
    document.body.appendChild(shScript);
  }
  ```

- **Modularisation of Functions:**  
  Separate the script injection logic and mutation observation into individual functions. This would improve readability and maintainability. For example, create a function for generating the unique ID and another for setting up the Mutation Observer.

- **Configuration Validation:**  
  Although the configuration is presumed valid, a simple check on `showHideConfig` (e.g. by verifying the expected properties exist for each target element) may improve robustness without compromising ES5 compatibility.

- **Enhanced Logging:**  
  Incorporate console logging for debugging, especially to capture errors when the remote script load fails or if mutations are not processed as expected. Ensure logs are optional to avoid performance impacts in production.

- **Commenting and Code Style:**  
  Increase inline comments within critical logic sections to aid future developers in understanding the flow. Maintain consistent formatting and spacing to conform with team coding standards.

- **Fallbacks for Missing Globals:**  
  While the current design assumes the existence of `LBGAnalytics` and `utag`, it may be beneficial to insert fallback error messages if these objects are missing, to ease troubleshooting.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ownership and Testing:**  
  - The extension should be maintained by the analytics or tag management team.
  - Regular testing in multiple environments is recommended to ensure compatibility when upstream libraries (like LBGAnalytics or Tealium's utag) are updated.
  - Implement unit tests for the key functions (script injection and mutation callback) to verify functionality as changes are made.

- **Logging and Monitoring:**  
  - Adding server-side or client-side logs for capturing failed script loads or unexpected mutation behaviour could help diagnose issues.
  - Monitor remote script update frequency to ensure configurations are current and correctly formed.

- **Documentation Updates:**  
  - Update this documentation when any changes are made to the extension.
  - Maintain a revision history to track the evolution of the code.

- **Future Enhancements:**  
  - Consider making the container selector configurable rather than hard-coded.
  - Evaluate the feasibility of introducing a more robust ID generation mechanism in future revisions while keeping ES5 compatibility.
