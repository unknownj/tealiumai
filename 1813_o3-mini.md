# Sustainability Metrics Extension Documentation

This document provides an in-depth explanation of the Tealium iQ extension "Sustainability Metrics". It covers the extension overview, code explanation, usage examples, known limitations, recommendations for refactoring, and maintenance notes.

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Sustainability Metrics  
- **Extension ID:** 100036  
- **Internal ID:** 1813  
- **Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** DOM Ready  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Once

**Summary:**  
This extension collects various page performance metrics with the aim of providing sustainability data insights. It measures:
- The total number of DOM elements present on the page.
- The size of the page’s body content.
- Navigation transfer size, and both the decoded and encoded sizes of the body.

These metrics are conditionally recorded based on a 0.1% random sampling chance. If all collected data values fall within a plausible range, the extension triggers events using the global LBGAnalytics SDK to log these sustainability metrics. This approach minimises performance overhead while providing periodic insights into page characteristics.

## 2. Code Explanation

- **Sampling Condition:**  
  The script starts by checking if a randomly generated number is less than 0.001 (`Math.random() < 0.001`). This means that there is roughly a 0.1% chance for the code block to run, avoiding performance impact on every page load.

- **Variable Declaration:**  
  A variable `sustainabilityMetrics` is declared as an object to store various performance data:
  - `elementsOnPage`: The total count of DOM elements retrieved using `document.querySelectorAll("*").length`.
  - `bodySize`: The length of the HTML contained within the `<body>` tag.
  - `transferSize`, `decodedBodySize`, `encodedBodySize`: These values are obtained from the first entry of the array returned by `window.performance.getEntriesByType("navigation")`.

- **Data Validation:**  
  A flag variable `dataIsBroken` is initialised as `false`. The code then iterates over each property in the `sustainabilityMetrics` object. If any metric is less than 0 or exceeds 10,000,000, `dataIsBroken` is set to `true`. This validation step helps ensure that the data being sent is reasonable and avoids sending corrupted or outlier values.

- **Event Triggering:**  
  Provided the data is valid (`dataIsBroken` remains `false`), the extension calls several methods on the global `LBGAnalytics.events` object:
  - A generic event is fired with an event code of 110 with a static value.
  - Additional generic events with event codes 111 through 115 are triggered, each logging one of the collected metrics.

- **Error Handling:**  
  A `try-catch` block encapsulates the main logic, ensuring that any exceptions (e.g. due to missing objects or incompatible browsers) are silently caught and do not disrupt the rest of the page’s operations.

- **Dependencies:**  
  - The global `document` object for DOM manipulation.
  - The global `window.performance` object for page performance metrics.
  - The global `LBGAnalytics` object, used for logging events.
  
All these dependencies must be available in the context where the extension runs.

## 3. Usage Examples

- **Normal Operation:**
  - On a typical page load, there is a 0.1% probability that the extension executes.
  - If run, it collects metrics (e.g. number of elements and body size) using standard DOM and performance APIs.
  - After validating that each metric is within a plausible range (0 to 10,000,000), it triggers specific LBGAnalytics events logging each metric.
  
- **Edge Condition (Data Out of Range):**
  - If any collected metric is negative or exceedingly high (above 10,000,000), the flag `dataIsBroken` is set to `true`.
  - In this scenario, even if the extension runs, no events will be fired because the data is deemed invalid.

- **Error Handling Scenario:**
  - If an exception occurs (for example, if `window.performance.getEntriesByType("navigation")` does not return any entries), the `catch` block ensures that the error is swallowed and no further action is taken.
  - This prevents the extension from interfering with the page’s normal operation even if an error is encountered.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Sampling Rate:**  
  The usage of `Math.random() < 0.001` means the extension runs very rarely. This may limit the data available for analysis during low-traffic periods or testing.

- **Dependency on Global Objects:**  
  - The extension relies on the availability of `window.performance`, `document`, and `LBGAnalytics`.  
  - In environments where any of these are missing or behave differently (e.g. older browsers), the extension may fail silently.

- **Metric Validation Range:**  
  The hardcoded check for metric values being less than 0 or greater than 10,000,000 may inadvertently filter out valid extreme cases or need adjustments based on different environments.

- **Conflict with Other Extensions:**  
  - There may be potential conflicts if other Tealium iQ extensions attempt to use or modify global objects like `LBGAnalytics` or alter the DOM before it is fully ready.  
  - The polling for all elements on the page (`document.querySelectorAll("*")`) might introduce performance overhead on very large pages.

- **Silent Failure:**  
  The empty `catch` block can make debugging more challenging if issues arise. Consider logging errors in development environments.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks:**  
  Although it is assumed that dependencies (such as `LBGAnalytics`) will be available, additional checks could be implemented to verify the presence of critical objects like `window.performance.getEntriesByType` and `document.body` before proceeding.

- **Code Modularity:**  
  Break down the code into smaller functions (e.g. one function for metric collection, another for validation, and another for event firing) to improve readability and maintainability.

- **Magic Numbers:**  
  Replace hardcoded numbers (like the 0.001 sampling threshold and the valid data range values) with named constants. This improves code clarity and ease of updates.

- **Error Logging:**  
  In the `catch` block, consider adding minimal logging (or conditional logging based on environment) so that issues can be diagnosed without impacting production performance.

- **Global Pollution:**  
  Wrap the entire extension in an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) to avoid polluting the global scope with temporary variables like `sustainabilityMetrics` and `dataIsBroken`.

- **Maintain ES5 Compatibility:**  
  Continue using ES5 syntax and conventions (such as using `var` instead of `let` or `const` and standard function declarations) to maintain compatibility with older browsers.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  - Regularly review the performance metrics and thresholds as website performance and content types evolve.
  - Periodically check the compatibility of performance APIs (`window.performance.getEntriesByType`) across supported browsers.
  - Validate that the `LBGAnalytics` object and its methods remain up-to-date with any changes in the analytics platform.

- **Ownership and Testing:**  
  - Assign a dedicated team or individual to maintain and test the extension, ensuring close monitoring during major browser updates or performance API changes.
  - Develop unit and integration tests that simulate both normal and edge-case scenarios, including stubs for the global `LBGAnalytics` and `window.performance` objects.
  - Use logging (if appropriate in development) to capture and monitor errors, so that silent failures can be identified and resolved more quickly.

- **Documentation Updates:**  
  Update this document in line with any code changes or refactoring to ensure that the team remains informed about the extension’s workings and limitations.
