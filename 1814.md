# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: `withContext`

## 1. Extension Overview
- **Name**: withContext
- **ID**: 100036
- **Type**: Javascript Code
- **Scope**: DOM Ready
- **Execution Frequency**: Run Once

### Summary
The `withContext` extension is designed to manage analytics events for a tracking system. It provides functionality to set journey variables, navigate within the application, and handle custom journey terms, thus enhancing data collection for user interactions across the website. The extension streamlines analytics tracking, ensuring that the relevant data is correctly formatted and sent to the analytics backend.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables and Functions
- `LBGAnalytics.events`: A namespace that holds various analytics-related functions, thereby grouping similar functionalities.
- `LBGAnalytics.events.withContext`: Alias for `LBGAnalytics.events.setVariables`, potentially for clearer semantic use.
- `LBGAnalytics.events.navigate(navigationString)`: Logs the navigation event using a `navigationString` that indicates the current navigational state.
- `LBGAnalytics.events.cacheEntryPoint(navigationString)`: Similar to the `navigate` function, but explicitly logs the entry point of navigation.
- `LBGAnalytics.data.setJourney(journeyName, journeyVersion)`: Handles the setting of journey-related variables by validating input and preparing payloads for analytics.
- `LBGAnalytics.data.setJourneyTerm(term1, optionalTerm2)`: Parses and processes journey terms, allowing for handling of different time formats.

### Logic Flow
1. **Navigation Handling**:
   - When navigating, the `navigate` method is called to log the navigation action with a passed string.
   - The entry point is similarly logged via `cacheEntryPoint`.

2. **Journey Variable Setting**:
   - The method `setJourney` assesses the `journeyName`, filtering out unwanted values and safety-checks for invalid scenarios.
   - It formulates a payload with the journey details and interacts with global analytics variables if needed.

3. **Journey Term Handling**:
   - The method `setJourneyTerm` employs handler functions to parse and validate journey terms, differentiating between various formats (numbers, ISO dates, etc.).
   - It constructs a payload based on parsed data and sends it for processing.

### Dependencies
- Utilises the global object `window`, particularly for logging and setting analytics variables. 
- Assumes the existence of a `window.clovaAcquire` object to set global analytics functions.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Normal Usage
```javascript
LBGAnalytics.events.navigate("HomePage");
// Console Output: Navigation: HomePage
LBGAnalytics.events.setJourney("UserOnboarding", "1.0");
// Sends a payload determining the journey and its version
```

### Scenario 2: Edge Case Handling
```javascript
LBGAnalytics.events.setJourney("Second Factor Authentication", "1.0");
// Will not proceed because journey name includes "second factor" and is filtered out
```
```javascript
LBGAnalytics.data.setJourneyTerm("3m", "6m");
// Constructs a payload reflecting the difference in terms: JourneyTermRaw: "monthstring: 3m - 6m"
```

### Invalid Input Example
```javascript
try {
    LBGAnalytics.data.setJourneyTerm("invalid-term", "another-invalid");
// Throws error due to invalid term format
} catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
}
```

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas
- **Error Handling**: The extension includes try-catch blocks that suppress errors, which may lead to silent failures. Developers should ensure error logging to track unpredicted behaviours.
- **String Parsing**: Terms need to be correctly formatted; otherwise, the extension will fail to parse them, potentially resulting in incorrect analytics data.
- **Browser Compatibility**: Must ensure that the environment supports basic JavaScript features, particularly since the extension adheres to ES5 standards.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring
- **Defensive Checks**: Enhance error handling; logging necessary errors would be beneficial for troubleshooting rather than suppressing them.
- **Modularisation**: Consider breaking down larger functions (like `setJourneyTerm`) into smaller, testable utility functions for enhanced readability and maintainability.
- **Code Style**: Maintain consistent formatting standards and comments throughout, aiding readability and ease of understanding for future developers.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes
- **Ownership**: Designate a responsible team or individual for the ongoing maintenance of this extension, ensuring that checks and updates are consistently applied.
- **Testing Guidelines**: Introduce unit tests to cover the main functions, particularly around data parsing and handling, to prevent regression with future changes.
- **Documentation**: Keep documentation updated as changes are made to ensure clarity for new developers or stakeholders interacting with the extension.

This documentation serves as a comprehensive guide for developers and stakeholders to understand, use, and maintain the `withContext` Tealium iQ extension effectively.
