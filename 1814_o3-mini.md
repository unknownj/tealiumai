# Tealium iQ Extension: withContext

This document provides a comprehensive overview and explanation of the "withContext" Tealium iQ extension, including its functionality, code flow, usage examples, limitations, and recommendations for future improvements.

---

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** withContext  
- **ID:** 1814 (Extension Identifier metadata: extensionId: 100036 indicates the library/group id)  
- **Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** DOM Ready  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Once  

**Summary:**  
The "withContext" extension augments the LBGAnalytics global object with additional methods for tracking analytics events and journey data. It provides functionality to:
- Alias one event method to another (`withContext` essentially re-uses `setVariables`).
- Log navigation and entry point events with custom methods.
- Set journey metadata and journey term information by parsing inputs such as numerical values, unit-based strings (e.g. "1m", "2w"), or ISO date strings to calculate durations.
- Condition handling within methods, gracefully handling errors and edge cases while ensuring that the analytics payload is properly constructed and passed on to the next layer.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables and Global Objects

- **LBGAnalytics:**  
  A global object assumed to be defined elsewhere which contains sub-objects `events` and `data`.  
  - `LBGAnalytics.events.withContext`: Aliases the `setVariables` method.
  - `LBGAnalytics.events.navigate`: Logs a navigation string.
  - `LBGAnalytics.events.cacheEntryPoint`: Logs an entry point.
  
- **LBGAnalytics.data:**  
  Contains methods to record journey information.  
  - `setJourney`: Accepts a journey name and version, applies a condition related to "second factor" paths and subsequently loads an analytics payload if applicable.  
  - `setJourneyTerm`: Processes term data to parse durations or date differences. Supports:
    - Numeric terms.
    - Unit-based strings for months/days (uses units like y, m, q, d, w).
    - ISO date formats for calculating day differences between dates.
    - A difference between two term values when provided two arguments.

### Logic Flow and Data Processing

1. **Event Aliasing and Logging Functions:**  
   - The extension first sets `LBGAnalytics.events.withContext` equal to `LBGAnalytics.events.setVariables`, effectively aliasing functionality.
   - It then defines two logging functions:
     - **navigate:** Logs a given navigation string and returns the analytics object to allow method chaining.
     - **cacheEntryPoint:** Logs an entry point string similarly and enables chaining.

2. **Journey Setup (`setJourney`):**
   - Checks if the journey name is a string and contains the phrase "second factor" (case-insensitive) while ensuring the current path is not "twofactorauth.jsp". If this condition is met, the function aborts further processing.
   - If a valid journeyName is provided, a payload is constructed containing JourneyName, JourneyVersion, and a fixed TagVersion value ("5").
   - The function then sets up analytics variable handlers on the global window object (including an assignment for `clovaAcquire` if possible) and finally calls `this.load(payload)` to forward the payload.

3. **Journey Term Calculation (`setJourneyTerm`):**
   - Defines unit conversion objects:
     - **UNITS_IN_MONTHS:** Converts years, quarters, and months to months.
     - **UNITS_IN_DAYS:** Converts weeks and days to days.
   - Contains multiple handler functions to:
     - Parse simple numbers.
     - Parse single unit strings, e.g. "10m" or "2w".
     - Parse multiple unit strings where several unit tokens are concatenated.
     - Parse ISO date strings in "YYYY-MM-DD" format and calculate the day difference with the current date.
     - Combine two terms by computing their difference (handling both month and day formats).
   - Depending on whether one or two terms are passed, it either parses a single term or computes a difference between two terms.
   - Constructs an analytics payload containing:
     - A raw string representation of the term type and value.
     - A calculated term value either in months or days (formatted with "d" appended for days).
   - Cleans up the payload to remove undefined or null values before calling `this.load(payload)`.

### Dependencies

- Relies on the presence of a global `LBGAnalytics` object with `events` and `data` properties.
- Uses global functions from the window object (e.g. `window.setAnalyticsVariables` and potentially `window.clovaAcquire`) to ensure compatibility with legacy analytics variable handling.
- Assumes the `this.load(payload)` method is defined in the surrounding analytics framework to accept and process the constructed payload.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Example 1: Tracking a Navigation Event

```javascript
// When a navigation occurs:
LBGAnalytics.events.navigate("Main Menu");

// Console Output: "Navigation: Main Menu"
// The method then returns the LBGAnalytics.events object for method chaining.
```

### Example 2: Caching an Entry Point

```javascript
LBGAnalytics.events.cacheEntryPoint("Homepage");

// Console Output: "Entry Point: Homepage"
// Again supports chaining.
```

### Example 3: Setting a Journey

```javascript
// Set a valid journey. If journeyName is "User Journey" and version "1.0":
LBGAnalytics.data.setJourney("User Journey", "1.0");

// This will build a payload:
// {
//   JourneyName: "User Journey",
//   JourneyVersion: "1.0",
//   TagVersion: "5"
// }
// The payload is then passed to this.load(payload).
```

### Example 4: Setting a Journey Term (Single Term)

```javascript
// Using a unit string:
LBGAnalytics.data.setJourneyTerm("3m");

// The handler parses "3m" as 3 months and constructs a payload, e.g.:
// {
//   JourneyTermRaw: "monthstring: 3m",
//   JourneyTerm: 3  // in months
// }
```

### Example 5: Setting a Journey Term (Range Terms)

```javascript
// Differentiating a term range using two arguments:
LBGAnalytics.data.setJourneyTerm("1m", "6m");

// The process computes the difference (5 months) and constructs a payload, e.g.:
// {
//   JourneyTermRaw: "monthstring: 1m - 6m",
//   JourneyTerm: 5  // difference in months
// }
```

### Edge Condition: Handling an ISO Date Term

```javascript
// Using an ISO date, e.g. "2023-12-31":
LBGAnalytics.data.setJourneyTerm("2023-12-31");

// The handler parses the date, calculates days from the current date, and sets type as "isoDate".
// If today is 2023-01-01, it would calculate the days difference.
```

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- The function in `setJourney` filters out journeys containing "second factor" (case-insensitive) unless the location pathname contains "twofactorauth.jsp". This may inadvertently skip valid journey events if the naming convention changes.
- The term parsing logic in `setJourneyTerm` is complex and may throw errors for unexpected formats. Although errors are caught and the function returns `this`, it may result in missing analytics payloads.
- The payload cleaning loop deletes properties with `undefined` or `null` values which might sometimes remove intended data.
- Dependency on the global `window.clovaAcquire` object for setting analytics variables may conflict if not correctly defined or previously initialised by other scripts.
- Logging via `console.log` in the production environment might not be desired or might be supressed in some browsers.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks and Error Handling:**  
  Ensure that all external dependencies, such as `this.load` and the global `LBGAnalytics` object, are fully verified before use.
  
- **Code Modularity:**  
  Break down the large `setJourneyTerm` function into smaller, testable modules, possibly refactoring the unit conversion methods into reusable helper functions.
  
- **Consistency in Data Formats:**  
  Standardise the output formats for the payload. For example, always return durations in a consistent unit (either solely in months or days) and clearly document this behaviour.
  
- **Verbose Logging Management:**  
  Consider an environment-dependent logging mechanism that can be disabled or routed to a logging service in production environments rather than using `console.log`.
  
- **Graceful Fallbacks:**  
  Where possible, implement fallbacks if external objects (like `window.clovaAcquire`) are not available instead of using try-catch blocks that silently swallow errors.

- **ES5 Compliance:**  
  Continue using ES5 syntax due to requirement constraints (e.g. function declarations, var instead of let/const), but improve code readability by clearly segmenting logical blocks with comments.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ownership and Versioning:**  
  Maintain version control for this extension separately from other analytics scripts. Ensure that any changes are tracked and communicated across teams.
  
- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  Implement unit tests for the parsing logic (particularly in `setJourneyTerm`) to validate different formats (numeric, unit strings, ISO dates). Testing edge conditions explicitly will improve overall robustness.
  
- **Documentation Updates:**  
  Update internal documentation if any changes to the journey term formats or analytics payload structure are introduced.
  
- **Monitoring in Production:**  
  Ensure that any logging or error reporting is monitored in production to catch any unexpected failures early, especially errors within the try-catch blocks that might mask issues.
  
- **External Dependencies:**  
  Periodically review dependencies on other global objects or libraries (e.g., LBGAnalytics, window.clovaAcquire) to ensure compatibility with ongoing platform and library updates.
