# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: Remove utag Object if Required

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name**: Remove utag object if required
- **ID**: 1820
- **Type**: Javascript Code
- **Scope**: Pre Loader
- **Execution Frequency**: Run Once

### Summary
This extension is designed to check for the existence of the `utag` object, specifically its `globals` and `track` properties. If certain conditions are met, it removes the `utag` object from the global scope. This is particularly useful for ensuring that the `utag` object does not interfere with other parts of your application, especially if tracking is not required or if a certain context necessitates the removal of its globals.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- **`window.utag`**: This is the global tracking object provided by Tealium. It contains various tracking and configuration elements.
- **`window.utag_stub`**: A temporary reference to the original `utag` object that is saved before deletion.

### Logic Flow
1. The code checks if `utag`, `utag.globals`, and `utag.track` exist in the `window` object.
2. If these conditions are true, it assigns the current `utag` object to `window.utag_stub`.
3. It then deletes the `utag` object from the global scope, thus preventing any further tracking actions that would otherwise be initiated by the `utag` object.

### Dependencies
- The extension relies on the existence of the global `window` object, which is standard in all browser contexts.
- It assumes the `utag` object may be present under normal circumstances.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Normal Operation
Within a normal tracking scenario, when the `utag` object exists:
- The extension executes and removes the `utag` object if it detects that tracking is not required.
- The absence of `utag` in the global scope ensures that additional tracking scripts do not inadvertently fire.

### Scenario 2: Incorrect Context
If `utag` is not defined or does not have `globals` or `track` properties:
- The code does nothing and the extension gracefully exits.
- The existing tracking functionality remains intact.

### Edge Condition: Error Handling
Should `utag` not exist at all:
- The conditions will evaluate to false, and the extension will not attempt deletion, preventing any errors.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Dependency on `utag`:** If the `utag` object is removed before this extension runs, the checks will fail, and the extension will not operate as intended.
- **Global Namespace Pollution:** The misuse of global variables outside this scope can lead to unpredictable behaviour if there are external scripts that also interact with a `utag` variable.
- **Interactions with Other Extensions:** Care should be taken as other extensions operating on the `utag` object could conflict if both are attempting to manipulate the same object.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Add Defensive Checks:** Consider implementing additional checks for the integrity of the `utag` object structure prior to deletion. For example, verify that `utag` is indeed an object before manipulating it.
  
- **Code Style Improvements:** Follow consistent code indentation and commenting to improve readability. Clear comments explaining the purpose of the conditions and actions taken can aid in maintenance.

- **Modularisation:** Breaking out the deletion functionality into a separate function could increase the modularity of the code, making it easier to test and reuse in other contexts.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:** 
   - Regularly verify the extension against new versions of the Tealium library to ensure compatibility.
   - Update documentation whenever changes are made to the extension logic or its interaction with the `utag` object.

- **Ownership:** 
   - Assign a dedicated team member who should be responsible for monitoring the performance and functionality of this extension.
  
- **Testing Guidelines:** 
   - Implement thorough testing during deployment cycles, especially when making modifications. 
   - Utilize both unit tests and integration tests where applicable, particularly in contexts where tracking data is crucial.

By following this documentation, developers and stakeholders will have a clear understanding of the extension's purpose, functionality, and maintenance expectations, ensuring effective use and longevity of the utility within the Tealium iQ environment.
