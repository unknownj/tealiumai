# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: Remove utag object if required

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the "Remove utag object if required" Tealium iQ extension, including its purpose, code explanation, usage examples, known limitations, recommendations for refactoring, and maintenance guidelines.

---

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Remove utag object if required
- **ID:** 1820 (Internal Extension ID); Extension ID: 100036 (Platform ID)
- **Type:** Javascript Code
- **Scope:** Pre Loader
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Once

**Summary:**  
This extension inspects the global `utag` object during the Pre Loader phase. It checks that:
- The global object `utag` exists.
- The property `utag.globals` is present.
- The property `utag.track` is NOT present.

If these conditions are met, the extension:
- Assigns the current `utag` object to a backup variable (`utag_stub`) on the global `window` object.
- Deletes the original `utag` object from the global scope.

The primary rationale is to eliminate or "stub out" a potentially incomplete or conflicting utag implementation whenever the complete tracking functionality (`utag.track`) has not been initialised, thereby preventing downstream script errors or conflicts.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables & Global Dependencies

- **window.utag:**  
  The primary global object used by Tealium for tag management. The code is dependent on this object being present in the global scope.

- **window.utag.globals:**  
  A sub-property of `utag` which indicates the presence of global configuration or settings.

- **window.utag.track:**  
  A normally available method on a fully initialised utag object that handles event tracking. Its absence is used to determine that the active utag object is incomplete or not fully functional.

- **window.utag_stub:**  
  A new global variable created to preserve the state or reference of the original utag object before it is deleted.

### Logic Flow

1. **Checking the Global Environment:**  
   The code executes an `if` statement to verify the presence of three conditions:
   - `window.utag` exists.
   - `window.utag.globals` is truthy.
   - `window.utag.track` is falsy (i.e. the tracking function is missing).

2. **Stubbing and Removal Process:**  
   - If the conditions are met, the entire `utag` object is assigned to `window.utag_stub`, thereby preserving its state.
   - The code then uses the `delete` operator to remove the `utag` object from the `window` object. This effectively prevents any further operations on the possibly incomplete utag object while allowing legacy references via `utag_stub`.

### Dependencies

- **Global Object Dependency:**  
  This extension strictly depends on the existence of the `window` object and the structure of the `utag` object. Any prior code that manipulates or depends on these objects should be compatible with this deletion process.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Example Scenario 1: Standard Flow

**Initial Condition:**
- `window.utag` exists.
- `window.utag.globals` exists (e.g., configuration object).
- `window.utag.track` does not exist (indicating an incomplete or stub instance).

**Execution Outcome:**
- The condition in the `if` statement evaluates to true.
- `window.utag_stub` is created and assigned the value of `window.utag`.
- The original `window.utag` is deleted from the global scope.
- Downstream scripts referencing `utag` will not find it, preventing potential errors from using an incomplete instance.

### Example Scenario 2: Edge Case – Fully Initialised utag

**Initial Condition:**
- `window.utag` exists.
- `window.utag.globals` exists.
- `window.utag.track` exists (indicating a fully initialised tag management object).

**Execution Outcome:**
- The condition `!window.utag.track` fails.
- The code does nothing; `window.utag` remains intact and available for standard tracking operations.

### Example Scenario 3: Missing utag or utag.globals

**Initial Condition:**
- Either `window.utag` is undefined, or `window.utag.globals` is missing.

**Execution Outcome:**
- The entire `if` condition fails.
- Neither the backup nor deletion process is triggered.
- The global utag object remains as it was, ensuring that no unintended side effects occur.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Dependency on Global State:**  
  The extension assumes that `window.utag` is defined in the expected structure prior to execution. If another script modifies `utag` unexpectedly, the extension may either run in error or lead to unexpected behaviour.

- **Potential Conflicts:**  
  If later scripts or other extensions expect `window.utag` to be present after the Pre Loader phase, they may encounter errors due to its deletion. It is essential to ensure that such scripts either refer to `utag_stub` or are aware of the deletion.

- **Single Execution Impact:**  
  Since the extension is designed to run only once, any subsequent modifications or re-initialisations of the `utag` object will not be handled by this extension. Developers need to ensure that the utag lifecycle is properly managed elsewhere if re-initialisation is required.

- **Lack of Logging or Error Reporting:**  
  The current implementation does not offer any logging mechanism or feedback if the condition is met or not met. This could hinder debugging in complex implementations.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks:**  
  Although the extension already verifies the presence of key properties, consider adding further defensive checks where possible (e.g. checking for the existence of `window` explicitly, if required by the deployment environment).

- **Modularisation:**  
  For improved maintainability, consider encapsulating the stubbing and deletion logic within a function. This modular approach makes unit testing easier and allows for more straightforward error handling.

  Example (using ES5 syntax):
  • function removeIncompleteUtag() {
  •  if (window.utag && window.utag.globals && !window.utag.track) {
  •   window.utag_stub = window.utag;
  •   delete window.utag;
  •  }
  • }
  • removeIncompleteUtag();

- **Comments and Documentation:**  
  Add inline comments to explain the rationale behind each check and operation. This is vital for future maintainers who might not be familiar with the underlying business logic.

- **Testing Enhancements:**  
  Develop unit tests or integrated tests to simulate various states of the `utag` object. Validate that the extension behaviour adheres to expectations under normal and edge-case scenarios.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  - Keep the documentation up-to-date with any changes to the utag object structure or Tealium iQ implementation.
  - Ensure that any new Tealium extensions that interact with `utag` are reviewed for potential conflicts.
  - Schedule code reviews to verify that the stubbed object does not interfere with other modules or third-party scripts.

- **Ownership:**  
  Assign clear ownership of this code, specifying which team or developer is responsible for monitoring its behaviour in production environments.

- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Include this extension in broader integration tests within the Tealium iQ environment.
  - Validate that the removal of `utag` does not disrupt tracking or data collection within the Tealium ecosystem.
  - Consider cross-browser testing to ensure that the deletion of a global object behaves consistently.

- **Future Enhancements:**  
  Consider incorporating logging or alert mechanisms to provide feedback during the execution phase, making it easier for developers to diagnose issues in a staging or production environment.
