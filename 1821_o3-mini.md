# Santa Extension Documentation

This document describes the Santa Extension, its internals and usage. It is intended to be a complete reference for developers and stakeholders.

---

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Santa  
- **ID:** 100036 (Extension ID), Internal ID: 1821  
- **Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** Pre Loader  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Once

**Summary:**  
The Santa extension is designed to provide a broad range of data manipulation routines (text, numeric, object) as well as rule processing and data extraction capabilities. It integrates with Tealium’s data layer and global objects (e.g. window, document) to perform transformations, process complex expressions, and handle various actions such as setting cookies, updating the data layer, or modifying DOM elements. Additionally, it supports dynamic evaluation of string criteria and chained operation processing with logging, validations and custom action handlers.

## 2. Code Explanation

### High-Level Structure

- **Global Namespace:**  
  The extension attaches itself to the global object `LBGAnalytics.santa`. It creates sub-components:
  - `QOps`: An object containing numerous helper methods for text, numeric and object manipulation – for example, removing whitespace, converting to uppercase, encoding URI components, numeric conversions, date formatting, JSON operations and more.
  - `QALRP`: A rule processing engine that parses and evaluates expressions. It supports enabling/disabling logging, custom string processors and additional control flow mechanisms (e.g. branching, loops, containers).

- **Main Flow:**  
  The code first defines `QOps` routines and then the more complex `QALRP` function. Later, additional routines are created (such as the `runRunners`, custom handlers, template management and event/action handling functions).  
  Finally, the main runner is executed if any queued actions exist.

### Key Variables and Functions

- **LBGAnalytics.santa.QOps:**  
  Contains methods for:
  - **Text Manipulation:** e.g. `removeWhitespace`, `toUpperCase`, `camelCase`, `snakeCase`, `reverse`.
  - **Numeric Manipulation:** e.g. `toNumber`, `round`, `multiply`, `subtract`.
  - **Object Manipulation:** e.g. `jsonParse`, `jsonStringify`, `formatDate`.
  
- **LBGAnalytics.santa.QALRP:**  
  A function that exposes:
  - An internal `fn` object holding the version number and helper functions (like `enableLogging`, `splitString`, etc).
  - **Logging Control:**  
    - `fn.enableLogging`: Configures and enables logging.
    - `fn.log`: Logs messages if logging is enabled.
  - **Expression Parsing:**  
    The `parseExpression` function tokenises an input expression to identify the variable, operators and arguments.
  - **Data Processing Functions:**  
    Functions such as `processBoolean`, `processFunction`, `processArray`, `processObject` and `processRule` apply different rules and data evaluations.
  - **Custom Processors and Extractors:**  
    - The extension supports adding custom string processor functions which are used to resolve expressions based on DOM selectors or data layer criteria.
    - `stringExtractor`: Returns processed data using the defined operations.

- **Runner and Action Handling:**  
  A separate block registers runners with three scopes (blr, alr, end) and defines a comprehensive `handleAction` function which is responsible for:
  - Evaluating the action type (for events, branch handling, loop actions, cookie setters, DOM manipulations, custom actions, etc).
  - Making use of helper functions like `evaluateDataObject` and `resolveDataPointer` which resolve values from the data layer, cookies, or the DOM.
  - Triggering custom handlers and even supporting late binding of template actions.

### Dependencies on Global Objects/Libraries

- **Global Objects:**  
  The extension uses:  
  - `window`: To resolve data pointers and dispatch events.
  - `document`: Used by selectors, query selectors, and MutationObservers.
  - `LBGAnalytics`: Utilised for cookies, data layer handling and as a namespace for additional methods.
  - Browser functions such as `encodeURIComponent`, `decodeURIComponent`, `btoa`, `atob`, and classic `setTimeout` / `MutationObserver`.

- **Tealium Specifics:**  
  The extension integrates with Tealium iQ by attaching routines that process data instructions and criteria in a flexible manner (via the QOps, QALRP APIs), so that macros or extensions elsewhere in your Tealium setup can rely on these routines.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Example 1: Data Manipulation
Suppose you want to transform a user’s name from the data layer, removing whitespace then capitalising the first letter.  
- Internally, you might invoke:  
  `LBGAnalytics.santa.QOps.removeWhitespace(userName);`  
  followed by  
  `LBGAnalytics.santa.QOps.capitalize(transformedName);`  

### Example 2: Rule Evaluation
An expression such as "JourneyName equals SummerSale" is processed by:
- Parsing the string in `parseExpression` which splits the text by spaces into a variable ("JourneyName"), an operator ("equals") and the target value ("SummerSale").
- The `nlpStringProcessor` uses this information to evaluate if the data stored in `window.JourneyName` (or from the dataObject) meets the criteria.
- Under edge conditions, if selectors fail (for example if the expected DOM element is not found), the function will return false.

### Example 3: Action Handling
The extension supports running custom actions when a particular condition is met. For instance, a Branch action may define a criteria and then:
- It evaluates the criteria using the QALRP routine.
- Depending on the evaluation, it will trigger either the "then" actions or the "else" actions.
- An action might include updating the data layer, setting a cookie, or modifying the DOM using routines like `setAttribute` or `removeElement`.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Complex Expression Parsing:**  
  The process of splitting expression strings may become unpredictable if using unexpected whitespace or characters. It relies on regular expressions that expect a specific format.
  
- **DOM & Data Pointer Dependence:**  
  Resolutions for data pointers using selectors (or attributes) may fail if the DOM structure changes or if the expected element does not exist.
  
- **Mutating Global State:**  
  As the extension relies on global objects (such as window and the LBGAnalytics namespace) changes made elsewhere in the page may result in conflicts or unexpected behaviour.
  
- **Runner Queues and Lazy Evaluation:**  
  Runners are added by pushing actions into an array which are later executed. This non-declarative control flow may become difficult to track during debugging.
  
- **Custom Handlers:**  
  Custom handler queues are maintained for actions not yet processed. If the registration order is not carefully managed, queued actions may not execute as expected.
  
- **ES5 Compatibility:**  
  The code is written in ES5 which restricts certain optimisations (e.g. block-scoped variables). Ensure that any proposed changes or integrations remain ES5 compliant.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Modularisation:**  
  Consider refactoring the extension into smaller modules where possible. For example, isolate QOps routines in one module and QALRP (the rule processing engine) in another. This can simplify maintenance and unit testing.
  
- **Defensive Checks:**  
  Although the environment guarantees the existence of event payloads and event types, further internal defensive checks (especially when accessing the DOM or using dynamic selectors) may help prevent runtime errors.
  
- **Code Comments & Documentation:**  
  Increase inline documentation (JSDoc style) for each helper function, especially the more complex ones such as `parseExpression` and `handleAction`.
  
- **Error Handling:**  
  Centralise error logging for run-time exceptions to help debugging and maintenance. Currently, errors are sometimes logged to the console. Consider using a dedicated error-reporting routine.
  
- **Testing & Unit Test Hooks:**  
  The code already exposes a “testExports” object that can be used for unit tests. It could be beneficial to extend this with test suites for each processing routine.
  
- **ES5 Best Practices:**  
  Retain the current syntax (function declarations, var declarations) but ensure consistency in formatting, indentation and naming conventions.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  - Ensure that there is version control for the extension. The current version numbers for QOps and QALRP are exposed (e.g. version "2.1" for QALRP and "2.2" in the global scope).
  - Periodically review dependencies on the DOM and global objects as integration points with Tealium may change.
  
- **Ownership & Testing:**  
  - Each functional module (data manipulation, rule evaluation, action handling) should have designated unit tests. Refactor tests around the exposed “testExports” functions.
  - Maintain a change log documenting changes to core algorithms, especially around expression parsing and action handling.
  
- **Integration Guidelines:**  
  - Carefully test new custom handlers or string processors in a staging environment.
  - Work closely with the Tealium integration team to ensure that runners (blr, alr, end) do not conflict with other pre-/post-load changes.
  
- **Documentation Updates:**  
  - Update this documentation as the code evolves.
  - Embed inline usage examples in release notes for future updates to ease onboarding for new team members.
