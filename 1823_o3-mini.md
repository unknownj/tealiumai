# New Payments Transformations Extension Documentation

This document provides an in-depth overview of the "New Payments Transformations" Tealium iQ extension, an explanation of its code logic, usage examples, known limitations, and recommendations for future improvements. This documentation is written in British English and adheres to GitHub Flavoured Markdown.

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** New Payments Transformations  
- **Extension ID:** 1823 (within the extension metadata)  
- **Extension Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** Before Load Rules  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Always  

**Summary:**  
The extension is designed to process and transform payment-related data within the event payload. It extracts specific payment information (such as remitter and beneficiary account types, transaction frequency, transaction date, and transaction recurrence) and constructs a concatenated string if certain conditions are met. This transformed value is then assigned to the payload property `JourneyProduct`, but only if the journey name (provided as part of the payload) indicates a payment transaction by beginning with the string "MakeTransaction".

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables:
- **eventType (a):**  
  A global variable representing the type of event. (Although it is not directly used in the logic, it is passed to the function and could be utilised in future enhancements.)

- **eventPayload (b):**  
  A global object containing data properties collected during the event. These properties may include:
  - `RemitterAccountType`
  - `BeneficiaryAccountType`
  - `TransactionFrequency`
  - `TransactionDate`
  - `TransactionRecurrence`
  - `JourneyName`
  
- **paymentType:**  
  An array used to accumulate string representations of individual payment data fields. Each field is prefixed with a short label (`"F:"`, `"T:"`, `"Q:"`, `"D:"`, `"R:"`) indicating what the value represents.

### Logic Flow:
1. **Initialisation:**  
   The function is defined as an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) with parameters `a` and `b` corresponding to `eventType` and `eventPayload`.
   
2. **Conditionally Building paymentType Array:**  
   - The code checks if each key exists (`if(b.RemitterAccountType)`, etc.).  
   - If present, the code pushes a string in the format "Label:Value" into the `paymentType` array.  
     - For example, if `b.RemitterAccountType` exists, it adds `"F:" + b.RemitterAccountType`.
     
3. **Final Assignment to JourneyProduct:**  
   - After building the array, the code verifies:
     - That at least one relevant payment property was available (i.e. `paymentType.length > 0`).
     - That `b.JourneyName` starts with `"MakeTransaction"` (using `indexOf("MakeTransaction") === 0` to validate).
   - When both conditions are met, the values in the `paymentType` array are concatenated into a single string separated by a pipe (`|`), and this string is assigned to the property `b.JourneyProduct`.

### Dependencies:
- The code relies on two globally available objects:
  - **eventType:** Guaranteed to be a string.
  - **eventPayload:** Guaranteed to be an object with the necessary properties.
- No external libraries are required as the operations use standard ES5 JavaScript methods.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Example 1: Normal Operation
**Input Payload:**  
```javascript
{
  RemitterAccountType: "Savings",
  BeneficiaryAccountType: "Current",
  TransactionFrequency: "Monthly",
  TransactionDate: "2023-10-15",
  TransactionRecurrence: "Recurring",
  JourneyName: "MakeTransaction_Payment"
}
```

**Processing:**  
- The `paymentType` array will be populated as follows:  
  - "F:Savings"
  - "T:Current"
  - "Q:Monthly"
  - "D:2023-10-15"
  - "R:Recurring"
- Since `paymentType` has values and the `JourneyName` starts with `"MakeTransaction"`, the `JourneyProduct` property will be set to:  
  `"F:Savings|T:Current|Q:Monthly|D:2023-10-15|R:Recurring"`

### Example 2: Partial Data Provided
**Input Payload:**  
```javascript
{
  RemitterAccountType: "Checking",
  TransactionDate: "2023-10-20",
  JourneyName: "MakeTransaction_Transfer"
}
```

**Processing:**  
- The `paymentType` array will be:  
  - "F:Checking"  
  - "D:2023-10-20"
- The condition is met as `paymentType.length > 0` and `JourneyName` starts with `"MakeTransaction"`.  
- The output `JourneyProduct` will be:  
  `"F:Checking|D:2023-10-20"`

### Example 3: Edge Scenario
**Input Payload:**  
```javascript
{
  BeneficiaryAccountType: "Business",
  JourneyName: "OtherTransaction"
}
```

**Processing:**  
- The `paymentType` array becomes:  
  - "T:Business"
- However, since the `JourneyName` does not start with `"MakeTransaction"`, the condition fails.  
- No modification is made to `eventPayload`, and `JourneyProduct` remains unset.

---

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Case Sensitivity of JourneyName Check:**  
  The function strictly checks if `JourneyName` begins with `"MakeTransaction"`. Variations in casing, spacing or prefixes can cause the condition to fail.
  
- **Dependence on the Presence of Specific Keys:**  
  The code assumes that if the keys exist, they contain usable data. Missing or empty values will simply be skipped, which may result in a blank or uninformative `JourneyProduct`.

- **Potential Conflicts with Other Extensions:**  
  Since the extension modifies `eventPayload`, there may be conflicts if other extensions in the same scope also manipulate `JourneyProduct` or related payment properties. Order of execution might influence the final payload.

- **No Formal Error Logging:**  
  In the event of unexpected data formats or runtime issues, there is no error handling or logging implemented.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Modularisation of Repeating Code:**  
  Consider creating a helper function to reduce code duplication for checking the existence of a key and pushing its value with its corresponding prefix.

- **Enhance the JourneyName Check:**  
  Depending on requirements, a more flexible or configurable check could be implemented, such as using a regular expression for case insensitivity or handling different prefixes.

- **Improve Code Readability:**  
  - Add inline comments to explain subtle parts of the logic.  
  - Separate the logic for building the string from the condition checking to improve code structure.

- **Documentation Comments:**  
  Introduce header comments above each section or function for clarity on the purpose and usage of the code blocks.

- **Maintain ES5 Compliance:**  
  Ensure that any enhancements or refactoring keep the code within ES5 standards. Avoid the use of ES6/ES2015 constructs such as arrow functions, template literals, or block-scoped variables (let/const).

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  - Assign a dedicated owner or team for managing this extension so that any changes in data schema, business logic, or integration requirements are promptly addressed.
  - Regularly review the extension as part of the overall Tealium iQ platform maintenance.

- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Develop comprehensive unit tests that cover scenarios with complete, partial, and invalid data.
  - Include tests to ensure that `JourneyProduct` is set only when conditions are met.
  - Simulate conflicts with other extensions to identify and resolve potential issues.

- **Change Log:**  
  Maintain a version history within the project repository so that any modifications or enhancements are tracked over time.

- **Stakeholder Communication:**  
  Share updates regarding changes to the extension with both developers and business stakeholders to ensure that any adjustments remain aligned with business requirements.
