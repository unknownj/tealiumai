# Nav Tracking 2023 Extension Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive overview, explanation, usage examples, known limitations, refactoring recommendations, and maintenance notes for the "Nav Tracking 2023" Tealium iQ extension (ID: 1844).

---

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Nav Tracking 2023  
- **ID:** 1844  
- **Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** Pre Loader  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Once  

**Summary:**  
This extension is designed to monitor and track user interactions with navigation elements on the webpage. It attaches click event listeners to different navigation regions (progressive navigation, megamenu v2, megamenu v3, and promo boxes) and constructs a "link path" that reflects the navigation context. When a navigation element is clicked, the extension caches tracking data in the session storage and later retrieves and forwards this data (within a 30-second window) to the global analytics object (window.LBGAnalytics) by setting the "NavigationPath" variable. This tracking mechanism provides valuable user interaction insights across various navigation components.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables

- **SELECTOR_PROGRESSIVE:**  
  CSS selector targeting links within the progressive navigation section (only links beginning with '/').

- **SELECTOR_MEGAV2:**  
  CSS selector for megamenu version 2 links that begin with a '/'.

- **SELECTOR_MEGAV3:**  
  CSS selector for megamenu version 3 links structured in a different HTML hierarchy.

- **SELECTOR_PROMO:**  
  CSS selector for promotional box links inside a container with the class `c-110-promo-box`.

- **LINK_DELIMITER:**  
  The delimiter string (" > ") used to concatenate parts of the navigation path.

- **STORAGE_KEY:**  
  The key ("LBGA.navlink") used to store and later retrieve the tracking payload in session storage.

### Core Functions and Logic Flow

- **trackLink(element, linkPath):**  
  - Attaches a click event listener to the passed element.  
  - On click, it attempts to store a JSON payload (including the provided `linkPath` and a timestamp) in sessionStorage.  
  - Uses a try/catch block to handle exceptions such as incognito mode restrictions.

- **getTrackedLink():**  
  - Attempts to retrieve and parse the cached tracking payload from sessionStorage using the `STORAGE_KEY`.  
  - The payload is removed from storage immediately after retrieval.  
  - Validates that the timestamp in the payload is within a 30-second window before returning the `linkPath`.  
  - Returns `null` if the payload is too old or if any error occurs.

- **Primary Execution Flow:**  
  1. The script first calls `getTrackedLink()` to check if any recent navigation data is available.  
  2. If valid data is found, it is set on the global analytics data layer (`window.LBGAnalytics.datalayer`) under the key "NavigationPath".  
  3. After a 1-second delay, the `trackNavLinks()` function is called, which:
     - Checks the document's language attribute to differentiate between English and other languages.
     - Iterates through each group of navigation elements (progressive, megamenu v2, megamenu v3, promo) using `document.querySelectorAll`.
     - Constructs a `linkPath` array containing strings that represent the navigation hierarchy and context.  
       - For example, in the progressive navigation, it determines if an element is visibly displayed or hidden and retrieves either its text content or a placeholder.  
       - For megamenu items, it navigates through hierarchical DOM relationships, using nested `closest()` calls and conditional expressions to extract text content.
     - Calls `trackLink()` for each element with the computed `linkPath`.

### Dependencies on Global Objects

- **window.LBGAnalytics:**  
  - The extension assumes that the global object `window.LBGAnalytics` exists and contains a `datalayer` object with a `set` method.

- **sessionStorage:**  
  - Used to temporarily store navigation data.  
  - Wrapped in try/catch blocks to handle possible errors (e.g. restrictions in incognito mode).

- **document APIs:**  
  - DOM selection methods such as `querySelector()`, `querySelectorAll()`, and `closest()` are used extensively.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Operation Scenario
1. **User Interaction:**  
   - A user clicks on a navigation link in the progressive nav section.
   
2. **Event Listener:**  
   - The `trackLink()` function attached to that element stores the JSON payload in sessionStorage with the link details and current timestamp.

3. **Data Propagation:**  
   - When the page is loaded (or after a set delay), the extension attempts to retrieve this payload via `getTrackedLink()`.
   - If the timestamp is within 30 seconds, the `NavigationPath` variable is set on `window.LBGAnalytics.datalayer`, making the data available for subsequent analytics processing.

### Edge Condition: Expired Link Data
1. **User Interaction:**  
   - A user clicks a navigation link, and the payload is stored.
   
2. **Delay in Retrieval:**  
   - If more than 30 seconds pass before the extension attempts to retrieve the payload (e.g. due to delayed page processing or navigation), `getTrackedLink()` will return `null`.
   
3. **Outcome:**  
   - No `NavigationPath` is set in the data layer, meaning the old navigation event is effectively discarded to maintain the relevance of tracking data.

### Handling Incognito Mode
- **Scenario:**  
  - In incognito or similar private modes, sessionStorage may be unavailable or restricted.
  
- **Outcome:**  
  - The try/catch block in `trackLink()` prevents errors from propagating even if sessionStorage operations fail, though tracking data might be lost.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Session Storage Availability:**  
  - The extension silently fails to store data in sessionStorage if the environment (such as incognito mode) restricts its use.

- **Selector Specificity:**  
  - The code relies on precise CSS selectors (e.g. using `:has()` pseudo-selectors) which may not work uniformly across all browsers. Browser compatibility should be verified.

- **Complex DOM Structure Navigation:**  
  - The heavy reliance on nested `closest()` calls and anonymous functions to build the link hierarchy can be fragile if the page structure is altered or is inconsistent.

- **Global Dependencies:**  
  - The extension depends on the existence of `window.LBGAnalytics` and its `datalayer`. If these are not present, the navigation path will not be set.

- **Error Silencing:**  
  - Although silent error handling prevents application crashes, it makes debugging difficult if a tracking error occurs.

- **Timing Dependencies:**  
  - The use of `setTimeout(trackNavLinks, 1000)` assumes that the DOM will be ready in that time; if the page loads slowly, some elements might be missed.

---

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Code Modularisation:**  
  - Consider breaking down the large `trackNavLinks()` function into smaller, more manageable, named functions to improve readability and reusability.

- **Error Handling Enhancements:**  
  - Although error silencing is intentional, it would be beneficial to log errors (e.g. using a custom logger) in a way that can be enabled during development but suppressed in production.

- **Selector Optimisation:**  
  - Centralise or validate the CSS selectors to ensure compatibility and avoid potential issues with the use of newer pseudo-selectors (like `:has()`) in environments constrained to ES5.

- **Caching and Performance:**  
  - Cache common DOM queries (e.g. checking the language attribute or common parent nodes) outside of loops where applicable.

- **Defensive Checks for Global Objects:**  
  - While the availability of `window.LBGAnalytics` is assumed, it may be prudent to include conditional checks to handle scenarios where this global object is not present.

- **Documentation in Code:**  
  - Adding more inline comments explaining the purpose of nested functions and complex DOM traversals would aid future developers in understanding the code logic.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Testing:**  
  - Regularly test the extension across all targeted browsers, especially focusing on DOM readiness, sessionStorage availability, and compatibility with different navigation layouts.

- **Ownership & Updates:**  
  - Clearly designate a maintainer or team responsible for the navigation tracking implementation.  
  - Document any dependencies on external global objects (like `window.LBGAnalytics`) so that any upstream changes are immediately reflected in this extension.

- **Versioning:**  
  - Use version control practices (e.g. git) to track changes and ensure that any modifications in selectors or tracking logic are consistently reviewed and tested.

- **Browser Compatibility:**  
  - As the code supports ES5, ensure that any changes maintain this baseline. Avoid introducing ES6+ features without considering the impact on older browser support.

- **Performance Considerations:**  
  - Monitor the performance of the extension, especially on pages with a heavy DOM. Optimise queries and consider debouncing if necessary.

- **Additional Logging for Debugging:**  
  - During troubleshooting or development phases, consider temporarily enabling debug logs to capture more detailed error information.
