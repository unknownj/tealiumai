# Santa Link Decoration Test Extension Documentation

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Santa Link Decoration Test  
- **Extension ID:** 100036 (Internal ID: 1845)  
- **Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** DOM Ready  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Once  

**Summary:**  
This extension is designed to modify (“decorate”) anchor links on a page by appending UTM parameters to the URL. Specifically, it targets links that include the strings "dayinsure.com" or "businessinsurance" in the href attribute. It utilises the LBGAnalytics.santa library function to perform the decoration action only on pages whose pathname meets one of the predefined criteria, ensuring that UTMs such as utm_source, utm_medium, and utm_campaign are correctly extracted and reassembled from the URL’s query string. The extension is intended for lazy container operations and runs once when the DOM is ready.

---

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables and Objects

- **LBGAnalytics.santa**  
  Global object used to call the decoration functionality via the `do` method. This library is assumed to be available on the page and incorporates the extension logic.

- **Action Object**  
  The main object passed to `LBGAnalytics.santa.do({…})` includes the following properties:
  - `"action": "lazy-container"`: Indicates that the inner actions will be evaluated lazily (typically after page load).
  - `"actions"`: An array containing one decoration action object.

- **Decoration Action**  
  Each action within the `"actions"` array includes:
  - `"action": "decorate"`: Specifies that the target is to decorate (or modify) DOM elements.
  - `"selector": "a[href*='dayinsure.com'], a[href*='businessinsurance'] "`: A CSS selector targeting anchor tags with href attributes containing the keywords.
  - `"parameters"`: An object defining UTM parameters (utm_source, utm_medium, utm_campaign) that should be extracted from the URL’s query string.
  - `"criteria"`: An array listing conditions (based on the pathname of the URL) under which the decoration should take effect.

### Logic Flow

1. **Initialisation:**  
   Once the DOM is ready, the extension runs because it’s set to "Run Once" and the scope is "DOM Ready".

2. **Action Trigger:**  
   The extension calls the method `LBGAnalytics.santa.do()` with an object containing a `"lazy-container"` action. This triggers further processing if the page meets any of the provided criteria.

3. **Decoration Routine:**  
   The inner decoration action:
   - **Selector Matching:**  
     Targets `<a>` anchors that have an href containing either "dayinsure.com" or "businessinsurance". There is an extra space at the end of the CSS selector string; care must be taken if this is unintentional.
   - **Query Parameter Extraction:**  
     For each UTM parameter – utm_source, utm_medium, and utm_campaign – the code accesses the `"search"` part of the URL (commonly the query string) and applies a series of operations:
     - Convert the query string to lower case (`toLowerCase`).
     - Split the string at the query delimiter (`split(?)`).
     - Use splice and join operations to isolate the required part of the string.
     - Further split and splice by the parameter name (e.g. `split(utm_source=)`) followed by handling additional delimiters (such as ampersands) to ensure only the desired value remains.
   - **Criteria Evaluation:**  
     The code only decorates the link if one of the following pathname conditions is met:
     - Exactly equals `/insurance/temporary-car-insurance.html`
     - Starts with `/insurance/business-insurance`
     - Starts with `/business/business-insurance`
     - Starts with `/business-insurance`

4. **Global Dependencies and Libraries:**  
   The proper functioning of this code is dependent on:
   - The existence of the global object `LBGAnalytics.santa` and its method `do`.
   - The data source referenced by `search` must contain the query string in a format where these operations make sense.
   - The Tealium environment which utilises lazy container actions.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Standard UTM Extraction and Decoration

**Situation:**  
A user navigates to the URL `/insurance/temporary-car-insurance.html?utm_source=Emailcampaign&utm_medium=Newsletter&utm_campaign=AutumnSale` and clicks a link with an href that includes "dayinsure.com".

**Process:**  
- The extension is triggered on DOM Ready.
- The criteria match because the pathname equals `/insurance/temporary-car-insurance.html`.
- The decoration action targets the anchor link.
- The operations on `search` will convert the query string to lower case, isolate the values:
  - utm_source becomes `emailcampaign`
  - utm_medium becomes `newsletter`
  - utm_campaign becomes `autumnsale`
- The link will be decorated with the extracted UTM parameters.

### Scenario 2: No Matching Criteria

**Situation:**  
A user visits a page with a pathname that does not match any of the criteria, say `/contact-us.html?utm_source=Test`.

**Process:**  
- The extension runs on DOM Ready.
- The criteria fail as the pathname is not one of the specified ones.
- As a result, even if the link exists and even if it matches the selector, no decoration occurs.

### Scenario 3: Edge Case with Missing UTM Parameter

**Situation:**  
A user navigates to `/business/business-insurance?utm_medium=Social` where utm_source and utm_campaign are missing.

**Process:**  
- The criteria match because the pathname starts with `/business/business-insurance`.
- The decoration action runs; however, for utm_source and utm_campaign, the operations applied on the query string may result in empty strings or undefined behaviour if not properly handled.
- The extension should ideally leave empty values or default them, but depending on implementation may show unexpected behaviour.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **CSS Selector Extra Space:**  
  The provided selector `"a[href*='dayinsure.com'], a[href*='businessinsurance'] "` includes an extra trailing space. Although many browsers may ignore this, it is good to check whether it affects element matching.

- **String Operation Complexity:**  
  The series of operations (`toLowerCase`, multiple `split`, `splice`, and `join` actions) is brittle. If the query string is not formatted exactly as expected (e.g. missing parameters or using different casing), these operations might fail, resulting in an empty or incorrect UTM value.

- **Single Execution and Criteria:**  
  The extension is executed "Run Once" on DOM Ready. Thus, if links are dynamically added later or the query string is modified after initial load, the decoration will not be applied.

- **Dependency on Global Library:**  
  The functionality depends on the availability and correct implementation of `LBGAnalytics.santa`. If this library is updated, deprecated, or unavailable, the extension will not work as intended.

- **Edge Condition Handling:**  
  If the query string contains multiple instances of the same parameter, the operations may not extract the intended value.

- **Potential Conflicts:**  
  The extension might conflict with other Tealium extensions or external scripts that manipulate the same anchor link elements or query parameters. Ensure that the order of execution is well tested and clearly defined.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Code Style and Readability:**  
  • Consider splitting the long chain of string operations into smaller, named helper functions for clarity.  
  • Provide comments within the code to explain each transformation step applied to the query string.

- **Error Handling:**  
  • Although defensive coding for eventType and eventPayload is not required, consider adding checks to ensure that the query string exists and contains the expected parameters before running the operations.
  
- **Modularisation:**  
  • Modularise the extraction of individual UTM parameters. Each parameter (e.g. utm_source, utm_medium, utm_campaign) could be processed by a dedicated function that encapsulates the transformation steps.
  
- **Testing Edge Cases:**  
  • Augment unit tests or manual test cases to cover scenarios where parameters are missing, duplicated, or in unexpected positions.
  
- **Documentation in Code:**  
  • Add internal code comments to document why each split/splice operation exists. This will aid future developers in understanding and maintaining the code.

- **Maintain ES5 Compatibility:**  
  • Ensure that the code continues to use ES5 syntax. Avoid inadvertently introducing ES2015 (or later) syntax such as arrow functions, template literals, or let/const declarations.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Testing:**  
  • Regularly test the extension on pages with varying URL structures and UTM parameter configurations to ensure continued correct operation.
  
- **Library Dependency Management:**  
  • Monitor updates from the LBGAnalytics suite to confirm that the `LBGAnalytics.santa` API still behaves as expected. Implement regression tests when the external library is updated.

- **Owner and Version Control:**  
  • Assign a clear owner or maintainer for this extension. Use version control for any changes in the extension code and maintain a changelog to document updates or bug fixes.

- **Documentation Updates:**  
  • Update both this documentation and in-code comments whenever changes are made. Ensure that new developments in the site’s structure or external dependencies are reflected.

- **Inter-extension Testing:**  
  • When adding or updating other Tealium iQ extensions, test the interaction between them, especially those manipulating similar DOM elements or URL parameters.
