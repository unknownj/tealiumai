# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: LinkValue Nickname Fix

## 1. Extension Overview
- **Name:** LinkValue Nickname Fix  
- **ID:** 100036  
- **Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** After Load Rules  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Always  

**Overview:**  
The "LinkValue Nickname Fix" extension is designed to clean up specific LinkValue parameters in the event payloads processed by Tealium iQ. It ensures that LinkValue strings conform to certain standards by filtering and formatting them, which helps maintain consistency in the data sent to analytics platforms. This enhances data quality and facilitates better reporting and analysis.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- `safeLinkValueParts`: An array that collects cleaned parts of the LinkValue.
- `linkValue`: The incoming LinkValue string that needs to be processed.
- `genericAccountTypes`: An array of predefined account types to filter from the LinkValue.
- `actionSuffixes`: A list of action indicators that might appear towards the end of the LinkValue.

### Logic Flow
1. **Initial Setup:** The code defines a function `cleanLinkValue` that takes `linkValue` as an input. It operates on the following principles:
   - If the `linkValue` starts with "AOV/", it extracts this prefix.
   - The first segment of `linkValue` is evaluated for uppercase status and length. If it meets the criteria, it is added to `safeLinkValueParts`.
   - The function checks the `linkValue` against the `genericAccountTypes` and adds any matches to `safeLinkValueParts`.
   - It searches through `actionSuffixes`. If any suffix is found, it splits the `linkValue` accordingly and appends those parts to `safeLinkValueParts`.
   
2. **Processing `LinkValue`:** The main code block checks if `b.LinkValue` is a string. If true, it iteratively checks against `actionSuffixes`, invoking the `cleanLinkValue` function if a match is encountered.

### Dependencies
- This extension relies on the `eventType` and `eventPayload` arguments passed into the IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression), which are guaranteed by the Tealium environment.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Sample Scenario 1: Normal Condition
- **Input:** `b.LinkValue` = "AOV/Basic Account/account tile"
- **Expected Output:** "AOV/Basic Account"

### Sample Scenario 2: Multiple Account Types
- **Input:** `b.LinkValue` = "Treasurers Account/payments and transfers"
- **Expected Output:** "Treasurers Account"

### Edge Condition: No Valid Parts
- **Input:** `b.LinkValue` = "Unrecognized Value"
- **Expected Output:** "" (empty string)

### Edge Condition: Action Suffix Present
- **Input:** `b.LinkValue` = "Current Account/more actions"
- **Expected Output:** "Current Account"

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas
- The extension only processes LinkValue strings that follow the expected formats. If an unexpected format is encountered, the output may be invalid or empty.
- There could be conflicts if other extensions manipulate `b.LinkValue` before this extension, leading to unforeseen results.
- Extensive lists for `genericAccountTypes` and `actionSuffixes` can hinder extensibility and might need updates based on changing data structures.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring
- **Modularisation:** Consider breaking down the `cleanLinkValue` function into smaller functions for improved readability and testability.
- **Defensive Checks:** While it's guaranteed that `eventType` and `eventPayload` are available, further validations on data types can be beneficial if the code evolves.
- **Code Style:** Follow consistent variable naming conventions and commenting throughout the code to enhance maintainability.
- **Error Handling:** Although not required, incorporating logging for unexpected values could help in debugging.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes
- **Ownership:** Document ownership within your team for ongoing responsibility over the code logic and updates.
- **Testing Guidelines:** Regularly test the extension against different `LinkValue` inputs to ensure it behaves as expected. Automated tests could help catch regressions in the future.
- **Documentation Updates:** Reflect any changes or enhancements made to the logic promptly in this documentation to keep it up to date for other developers.
