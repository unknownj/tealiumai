# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation â€“ "LinkValue Nickname Fix"

This document provides comprehensive details for the "LinkValue Nickname Fix" Tealium iQ extension. It covers an overview of the extension, an explanation of its code, usage examples, known limitations, recommendations for refactoring, and further maintenance notes.

---

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** LinkValue Nickname Fix
- **ID:** 1856 (Extension); 100036 (Extension Metadata)
- **Type:** Javascript Code
- **Scope:** After Load Rules
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Always

**Summary:**  
The extension inspects and modifies the value of the `LinkValue` property in the event payload. It performs a series of checks and string manipulations to ensure that the link value complies with a safe/internal format based on specific account types and known action suffixes. By doing so, it helps standardise link values which might be coming from various sources, ensuring consistency before further processing in analytics or tag management environments.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables & Functions

- **cleanLinkValue(linkValue):**  
  A helper function that accepts the link value (string) and processes it by:
  - Breaking out specific parts based on patterns.
  - Extracting portions when the link starts with "AOV/".
  - Checking if the initial segment (linkValue stem) is fully uppercase and shorter than or equal to 4 characters.
  - Matching segments against a list of generic account types.
  - Processing known action suffixes like "account tile", "more actions", etc.  
  The function returns a cleaned-up and concatenated string with selected segments.

- **safeLinkValueParts:**  
  An array that accumulates the processed segments of the link value. It is eventually joined back together with "/" as a delimiter.

- **global objects:**  
  - `eventType` and `eventPayload` are provided as parameters to the self-invoking function.  
  - `b.LinkValue` is used to reference the data property in the event payload, making modifications only if it is a string.

### Logic Flow

1. **Initial Check:**  
   The code first checks if `eventPayload.LinkValue` (here accessed as `b.LinkValue`) is a string. This ensures the subsequent processing is valid.

2. **Action Suffix Check:**  
   For each known action suffix in the `actionSuffixes` array:
   - The code converts the linkValue to lowercase and looks for the presence of the suffix.
   - If found, it reassigns `b.LinkValue` to the result of the `cleanLinkValue` function call.

3. **cleanLinkValue Function Details:**  
   - **Prefix Handling:**  
     If the link value starts with "AOV/", then it pushes "AOV" to the parts array and strips "AOV/" from the link.
   - **Link Stem Evaluation:**  
     The code then isolates the first segment of the updated link value (split by "/"). If this segment is entirely uppercase and its length is 4 or fewer characters, it is deemed safe and included.
   - **Generic Account Types:**  
     The function maintains an array of generic account type strings. It splits the link value by "/" and checks, case-insensitively, if any segment matches these types. Matches are appended to the safe parts.
   - **Action Suffixes Processing:**  
     The function iterates over the suffixes, and if the link value (in lowercase) includes a segment matching a suffix (preceded by "/"), it:
     - Slices from that match onwards.
     - Splits the remainder by "/" and appends each part.
     - Stops further processing after the first match.
   - **Final Assembly:**  
     The safe parts collected are joined with "/" to form the cleaned link value which is then returned.

### Dependencies

- This extension does not rely on any external libraries beyond the base browser/Tealium iQ environment and expects global variables `eventType` and `eventPayload` (with a property `LinkValue`) to be defined.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Condition Example

- **Given Input:**  
  Suppose `eventPayload.LinkValue` is `"AOV/XYZ/Current Account/more actions/extra"`.
  
- **Processing Outline:**
  - The function detects the "AOV/" prefix, leading to collection of `"AOV"`.
  - It removes "AOV/" resulting in `"XYZ/Current Account/more actions/extra"`.
  - `"XYZ"` is evaluated. Since it is uppercase and the length is 3 (<=4), it is added.
  - It then checks each segment against the generic account types.
  - The term `"Current Account"` (adjusting for case-sensitivity) matches a known generic account type, and `"more actions"` is identified as one of the action suffixes.
  - The cleaned link value might be concatenated as: `"AOV/XYZ/Current Account/more actions/extra"` (assuming that all segments pass based on the algorithm's logic).

### Edge Condition Example

- **Given Input:**  
  If `eventPayload.LinkValue` does not contain any of the defined action suffixes, then the extension does nothing, and the original value remains unchanged.
  
- **Alternate Scenario:**  
  If no segment matches the uppercase check or account types, then the only processing may occur when detecting a suffix. If no suffix is found, the link value remains intact.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Case-Sensitive Matching:**  
  - Although the code handles case conversion in parts (e.g. using `.toLowerCase()`), specific matching input segments might not always align as expected if there is inconsistent casing in the input.

- **Single Match Enforcement:**  
  - Once the first matching action suffix is found, the loop breaks even if subsequent parts of the link value could also contain relevant segments. This may be by design, but it limits further processing.

- **Generic Account Types Array:**  
  - The list of `genericAccountTypes` is hard-coded. If new account types emerge or naming conventions change, the array must be updated accordingly.

- **Dependencies Assumption:**  
  - The function assumes that `eventPayload.LinkValue` is a string. If it is not, no processing takes place, and developers must ensure data is pre-validated.

- **Potential Conflicts:**  
  - Ensure no other extension simultaneously alters `eventPayload.LinkValue` after this extension runs, to prevent conflicts or data overwrites.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Programming:**  
  Although the availability of `eventType` and `eventPayload` is guaranteed, consider additional type checking for `LinkValue` if other integrations might modify its type unexpectedly in the future.

- **Modularisation:**  
  - Break the logic into smaller helper functions if additional processing is required later. For example, separate the handling of the "AOV/" prefix, uppercase stem, and account type filtering into distinct functions.
  
- **Code Comments & Readability:**  
  - Increase inline comments to explain the purpose behind key sections, especially the filtering logic for account types and suffixes, making maintenance easier for future developers.
  
- **Loop Improvement:**  
  - Document the rationale behind breaking out of the action suffix loop early. Consider if multiple suffixes should ever be processed and clarify this in the comments.
  
- **Testing Edge Cases:**  
  - Develop unit tests for the `cleanLinkValue` function to simulate various link value scenarios. This will help ensure that changes or refactoring do not break expected behaviours.

*Note: Refactoring recommendations must adhere strictly to ES5 syntax; therefore, avoid using ES6 features like arrow functions, template literals, or block-scoped variable declarations (let/const).*

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**
  - Assign ownership to a development team knowledgeable in Tealium iQ and the specifics of this tagging environment.
  - Schedule periodic reviews of the generic account types list and action suffix arrays to ensure they remain up-to-date with business requirements.

- **Testing Guidelines:**
  - Ensure thorough unit and integration tests are in place, including tests for inputs that do not require modifications or have unexpected formats.
  - Verification should be performed in both staging and production environments.

- **Documentation Updates:**
  - Record any changes to the extension here in this documentation file.
  - Consider version control annotations and include comments that refer to revision history if modifications to the extension arise.

- **Integration Considerations:**
  - Validate the order of execution among other Tealium extensions to avoid conflicts.
  - Collaboration with stakeholders to document any related changes in data flows or payload formats is recommended.
