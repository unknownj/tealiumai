# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: Elementool

## 1. Extension Overview
- **Name**: Elementool
- **ID**: 100036
- **Type**: Javascript Code
- **Scope**: Pre Loader
- **Execution Frequency**: Run Once

### Summary
The Elementool extension is designed to facilitate the creation, manipulation, and dynamic rendering of HTML, SVG, and MathML elements within a webpage. It provides utility functions for generating elements with specified content, styles, and event listeners, enhancing interactivity and user engagement. The extension leverages methods to transform polar coordinates to Cartesian coordinates, apply styles, and manage attributes, ensuring a flexible and robust foundation for element handling.

---

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- **`self`**: A reference to the instance of the Elementool, allowing closure access to its properties and methods.
- **`elementsWithDynamicValues`**: An array to keep track of elements that have dynamic styles or content for later rendering.
- **`util`**: A namespace containing utility functions for element creation, style application, and coordinate transformations.

### Logic Flow
The main logic flow can be broken down as follows:

1. **Element Creation**:
    - The method `make` is invoked with a selector, content, styles, and optional event listeners to create a new element.
    - Depending on the provided `selector`, it may result in an HTML, SVG, or MathML element.

2. **Dynamic Value Handling**:
    - The extension maintains a collection of elements that require re-rendering, accommodating dynamic content or styles.
    - The `render` method is called on these elements to update their properties based on the defined dynamic values.

3. **Styling and Attributes**:
    - The `applyStylesToElement` and `setAttributesOnElement` functions allow modification of element styles and attributes based on inputs received from the caller.

### Dependencies
The extension relies on the global `window` object for adding event listeners and accessing supported features such as SVG and MathML elements.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Basic Element Creation
```javascript
// Create a new div with text content and append it to the body
Elementool.make('div', 'Hello, world!').appendTo(document.body);
```

### SVG Element Creation
```javascript
// Create a new circle with red fill and black stroke and append it to the body
Elementool.draw('circle', undefined, { fill: 'red', stroke: 'black' }).appendTo(document.body);
```

### Dynamic Updates
```javascript
// Create a dynamic element that updates its content
var dynamicDiv = Elementool.make('div', function() {
  return "Current time is: " + new Date().toLocaleTimeString();
}).appendTo(document.body);

// Trigger re-render if needed
dynamicDiv.render();
```

### Handling Attributes
```javascript
var myDiv = Elementool.make('div');
myDiv.setAttributes({
  'data-role': 'important',
  'data-info': function() { return Math.random(); }
});
```

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas
- The extension may not behave as expected if the specified selector cannot be found in the DOM when attempting to append new elements.
- Elements created with event listeners need to ensure that the handler functions are defined within the appropriate scope.
- If using dynamic attributes that depend on functions, ensure that the computed values are valid, as errors in these can lead to silent failures in rendering.

---

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring
- **Error Handling**: Implement logging mechanisms for silent failures, particularly in the `objectToElement` method, to debug issues more efficiently.
- **Code Style**: Consistently format callback invocations and array manipulations for better readability. Utilise `for...in` with `hasOwnProperty` checks to ensure proper prototype handling in the `setAttributesOnElement` method.
- **Modularisation**: Consider breaking down large functions into smaller, reusable ones to promote modularity. For example, separating the logic for building attribute strings can improve clarity.
- **Performance Enhancements**: Leverage document fragments when appending multiple elements in loops to enhance performance when manipulating the DOM.

---

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes
- **Ongoing Maintenance**: Establish a process for regularly reviewing the extension for compatibility with the latest browsers and standards.
- **Ownership**: Assign a dedicated developer to oversee this extension, ensuring timely updates and addressing any bugs reported by users.
- **Testing Guidelines**: Implement unit testing for critical methods to confirm functionality as changes are made. Use tools compatible with ES5 for broader support.
- **Documentation Updates**: Encourage contributions to this documentation whenever new features are added or existing ones are modified, ensuring it stays relevant and useful for developers.
