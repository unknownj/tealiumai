# Elementool Extension Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive overview and technical explanation of the Elementool extension used in Tealium iQ. It covers the extension’s purpose, detailed code explanation, usage examples, known limitations, refactoring recommendations, and maintenance guidelines.

---

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Elementool  
- **Extension ID:** 1885 (Library Extension ID: 100036)  
- **Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** Pre Loader  
- **Occurrence:** Run Once  

**Summary:**  
The Elementool extension is designed to dynamically create and manipulate DOM elements – including HTML, SVG, and MathML elements – based on CSS selector strings. It provides an API for setting element content, styles, attributes, and event listeners. Furthermore, it offers helper methods for creating common SVG shapes (circles, ellipses, lines, polygons, etc.) and handling animations. The extension also includes accessibility helpers and util functions to process selectors into components, resolve relative selectors, and apply dynamic updates through render callbacks. This makes it a powerful utility for building dynamic and responsive UI elements within Tealium iQ environments.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables and Structure

- **`self` and `this`:**  
  The extension utilises the common pattern of assigning `this` to the `self` variable to maintain scope, especially within nested functions and callbacks.

- **Primary Methods:**  
  - **`this.make(selector, optionalDescendants, optionalStyleObject, optionalEventListeners)`**  
    Creates a new HTML element based on a selector string, optional content (text, Element, or an array of Elements), and applies styles and event listeners.  
  - **`this.draw(selector, optionalDescendants, optionalStyleObject, optionalEventListeners)`**  
    Creates a new SVG element using a namespaced document creation method. It extends the returned element with SVG-specific helper methods such as `animate` and `moveElementBehind`.  
  - **`this.math(selector, optionalDescendants, optionalStyleObject, optionalEventListeners)`**  
    Similar to `make`, except it creates MathML elements (using the MathML namespace).
  - **`this.objectToElement(obj)`**  
    Converts an object literal whose properties include `make`, `draw`, or `math` (plus optional `content`, `styles`, and `listeners`) into a corresponding Element. It includes error trapping to fail silently if the object does not meet requirements.

- **Helper Objects:**
  - **`this.util`:**  
    A collection of utility functions including:
    - **`polarToCartesian`:** Converts polar coordinates to Cartesian coordinates.
    - **`selectorToComponents`:** Breaks a CSS selector string into its component parts such as tag name, ID, class list, and attributes.
    - **`resolveRelativeElement`:** Parses selectors with combinators (like `>` or `+`) to determine parent or sibling relationships.
    - **`applyStylesToElement`:** Applies styles to an element, handling both standard JS style notation and CSS notation (e.g. converting `margin-left` to `marginLeft`).
    - **`setAttributesOnElement`:** Sets attributes on an element and supports dynamic attribute values.
    - **`make`:** The core element creation function that ties together the above utilities. It creates the element, applies content, style, event listeners, and automatically sets helper methods (`appendTo`, `setStyles`, `setAttributes`, `setContent`, and `render`).

  - **`this.svgHelpers`:**  
    Contains methods specifically for creating and manipulating SVG elements:
    - Methods such as `circle`, `ellipse`, `line`, `polygon`, `polyline`, `rect`, and `text` that generate attribute strings and create corresponding SVG elements.
    - Functions for creating animations (e.g. `animate`, `animateTransform`, `animateMotion`) which append special `animate` elements to SVG nodes.
    - Additional utilities for handling grouping, masking, clipping, and gradients in SVG.

  - **`this.accessibilityHelpers`:**  
    Provides simple wrappers to set ARIA attributes and roles on elements for better accessibility compliance (e.g. setting `role="button"` or `role="link"`).

- **Dynamic Data Handling:**  
  The code tracks elements with dynamic values (styles, content, or attributes) in the `self.elementsWithDynamicValues` array. It provides a centralized `render` function that iterates over these elements to update their dynamic properties. Render callbacks can also be attached to individual elements.

- **Event Listener Support:**  
  When optional event listeners are provided, the extension attaches them to the created element. It supports both function references and string names (which refer to global functions).

### Flow of Data and Processing

1. **Selector Parsing:**  
   - The `selectorToComponents` method splits a selector string to extract the tag name, ID, class names, and any attributes.
   - The `resolveRelativeElement` method determines if the selector references a specific parent or sibling element using combinators.

2. **Element Creation:**  
   - Based on parsed components, an element is created using `document.createElement` (or `document.createElementNS` if a namespace is provided).
   - The element’s attributes, classes, and ID are set accordingly.

3. **Content and Styles Application:**  
   - Content is applied to the element by checking its type (string, function, element, or an array of elements).
   - Styles are applied using the `applyStylesToElement` function, with special handling for dynamic function-based values.

4. **Dynamic Updates:**  
   - For dynamic styles, content, or attributes, elements are registered and a render function is available to update them over time.

5. **SVG Specific Handling:**  
   - For SVG elements, additional helper methods (e.g. for animations) are added.
   - Attribute strings are generated to facilitate the creation of SVG elements.

### Dependencies

- **Global Objects:**  
  Relies on standard browser globals such as `document`, and optionally on SVG related global objects such as `SVGElement` and `MathMLElement` for namespace handling.
- **Tealium Analytics:**  
  If the global `window.LBGAnalytics` object is present, Elementool is attached as both `window.LBGAnalytics.Elementool` and an instance is made available as `window.LBGAnalytics.el4`.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Example 1: Creating a Basic HTML Element

```javascript
// Create a new div with text content and append it to the body.
var newDiv = window.LBGAnalytics.el4.make('div', 'Hello, world!');
newDiv.appendTo(document.body);
```

In this example, the `make` method is used to create a `<div>` element. The content is a simple text string. The element is then appended to the body using the custom `appendTo` method.

### Example 2: Creating an SVG Element with Dynamic Animation

```javascript
// Create an SVG circle with certain styles and animate it.
var circle = window.LBGAnalytics.el4.draw('circle', undefined, { fill: 'red' });
circle.setAttributes({ cx: 50, cy: 50, r: 40 });
circle.animate('r', 40, 30, '1s', 'indefinite', 'freeze');
circle.appendTo(document.querySelector('svg'));
```

This example demonstrates how to:
- Create an SVG circle using the `draw` method.
- Set its attributes (center coordinates and radius).
- Apply an animation on the `r` attribute.
- Append the circle to an existing SVG element in the DOM.

### Example 3: Using Object Definitions for Element Creation

```javascript
// Define an element using an object literal with the 'make' property.
var elementDefinition = {
  make: 'div.myClass',
  content: 'Dynamic content',
  styles: {
    'background-color': 'blue',
    'fontSize': '16px'
  },
  listeners: {
    click: function () {
      alert('Element clicked!');
    }
  }
};

var dynamicElement = window.LBGAnalytics.el4.objectToElement(elementDefinition);
dynamicElement.appendTo(document.body);
```

In this instance, an object literal is used to generate an HTML element. The `objectToElement` method processes the object and creates an element with the provided content, styles, and event listeners.

### Handling Edge Conditions

- When optional parameters such as `optionalDescendants`, `optionalStyleObject`, or `optionalEventListeners` are `undefined` or missing, the extension falls back to defaults.
- If an invalid selector is provided, the utility functions may not correctly parse the selector. In such cases, the element creation might not meet expectations, though errors are largely caught silently (especially in `objectToElement`).
- Dynamic attributes or content defined as functions will register the element for dynamic updates and can be rendered later via the `render` function.

---

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Silent Failures:**  
  The `objectToElement` method contains a try-catch block that swallows errors. If an object is malformed, the failure is silent, and the developer may not receive immediate feedback.

- **Dynamic Updates:**  
  Elements with dynamic styles, attributes, or content rely on being tracked in an internal array. If not rendered manually (via the `render` method), these dynamic properties may not update as expected.

- **Selector Parsing Complexity:**  
  The utility functions for breaking down selectors assume a certain format and may not handle complex selectors or edge cases perfectly. Special care must be taken when including advanced attribute selectors or multiple combinators.

- **Namespace Handling:**  
  The extension distinguishes between HTML, SVG, and MathML elements based on the namespace. Ensure that the right method (make, draw, or math) is used according to the type of element required.

- **Potential Conflicts:**  
  As the extension attaches helper methods to the created elements (e.g., `appendTo`, `setStyles`, `render`), there is a possibility of conflicts if other scripts or extensions add methods or properties with the same names.

---

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Code Modularity:**  
  Consider separating the utilities (`util`, `svgHelpers`, `accessibilityHelpers`) into distinct modules or files for better organisation and easier maintenance. This may simplify debugging and testing.

- **Improved Error Handling:**  
  Instead of failing silently in functions like `objectToElement`, consider logging errors or providing a mechanism for error reporting (in a way that does not break ES5 compatibility).

- **Consistent Coding Style:**  
  Ensure that all functions and loops use consistent patterns. For example, the pattern for checking properties with `if (object.hasOwnProperty(property))` could be standardised across the module.

- **Defensive Checks:**  
  While defensive coding regarding `eventType` and `eventPayload` is not required, additional checks and comments within helper functions (such as during dynamic value assignments) might improve maintainability.

- **Documentation & Comments:**  
  Additional inline comments in complex methods (such as `applyStylesToElement` and `resolveRelativeElement`) will help future developers understand the logic without having to reverse-engineer the code.

- **ES5 Conformance:**  
  Continue to avoid ES6+ features (e.g. arrow functions, let/const, template literals) to ensure compatibility with ES5. Ensure that any new code additions remain compliant with these requirements.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Develop unit tests for each utility function (e.g., verifying that `selectorToComponents` correctly parses various CSS selectors).  
  - Test dynamic behaviour via the `render` methods, ensuring that elements update as expected when dynamic functions are used for content or styles.

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  - Assign ownership of the Elementool code to a specific team or developer to ensure familiarity with both the DOM manipulation logic and SVG helper functions.
  - Maintain detailed change logs and use version control practices to track updates or modifications.
  - Schedule periodic code reviews to refactor legacy patterns and ensure adherence to best practices.

- **Documentation:**  
  - Keep this documentation updated with any modifications or extensions to the API.
  - Encourage the use of inline code comments for any new helper methods or changes to existing ones.

- **Integration Checks:**  
  - Verify compatibility with other Tealium iQ extensions, especially those that manipulate the DOM or apply their own dynamic updates.
  - Monitor for potential conflicts when multiple extensions attempt to modify attributes or styles on the same element.

- **Stakeholder Communication:**  
  - Provide regular updates to developers and stakeholders, especially when refactoring is planned or when new features are integrated.
  - Ensure that testing environments reflect all use cases covered in this documentation.
