# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: EventStream uvar Code

## 1. Extension Overview
- **Name:** EventStream uvar code
- **ID:** 1893
- **Type:** Javascript Code
- **Scope:** After Load Rules
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Always

### Summary
This extension is designed to map a series of user variables (u variables) as defined within a specified context. The mapping process involves setting values for various parameters related to user journeys and other relevant behaviours while ensuring that personally identifiable information (PII) is not passed through. The filtering process adheres to consent management by selectively removing sensitive data based on cookie consent status.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- `pl`: An object that holds the mappings of user variables to their respective values, drawn from the event payload.
- `eventType`: The type of event triggering the extension.
- `eventPayload`: The data associated with the triggering event.

### Logic Flow
1. **Mapping User Variables**: 
   - An object `pl` is created to map specific user variables (U1, U2, etc.) to values obtained from the `eventPayload` object.
   
2. **PII Filtering**: 
   - The extension iterates through each mapped variable in `pl` and removes any value that contains an "@" or "%40" to mitigate the risk of sending sensitive information.
  
3. **Removing Missing Values**: 
   - Any mapped variable that does not have a value is deleted from the `pl` object, ensuring only valid entries persist.
  
4. **Consent Check**: 
   - If the `CookiesTargeting` property is not true, it removes sensitive variables (U8, U7, U28) from the `pl` object to comply with consent regulations.
  
5. **Setting Data Layer Values**: 
   - The keys (uVariableNames) and values (uVariableValues) from the `pl` object are set into the `clova3.datalayer`, ensuring they are available for downstream processing.

### Dependencies
This extension relies on the global `clova3.datalayer` object to set the mapped user variable names and values. It also interacts with properties of the `eventPayload` and assumes specific structure within that object.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Normal Operation
When the extension is triggered by an event, it processes the event payload to map user variables. If the payload includes a brand and a journey step, it would store these in the datalayer as follows:
- **Input**: 
    ```javascript
    {
        Brand: 'Example Brand',
        JourneyStep: 'Checkout',
        CookiesTargeting: true
    }
    ```
- **Output**: 
    - `uVariableNames`: `["U1", "U4"]`
    - `uVariableValues`: `["Example Brand", "Checkout"]`

### Scenario 2: PII Filtering
If the event payload includes an email address:
- **Input**: 
    ```javascript
    {
        FirstPartyCookie: 'user@example.com',
        CookiesTargeting: true
    }
    ```
- **Output**: 
    - The `FirstPartyCookie` value would be removed from the `pl` object, resulting in:
    - `uVariableNames`: `[]`
    - `uVariableValues`: `[]`

### Edge Condition: No Consent
If a user has not provided consent:
- **Input**: 
    ```javascript
    {
        FirstPartyCookie: 'user@example.com',
        CookiesTargeting: false
    }
    ```
- **Output**: 
    - Sensitive variables are removed, including `u8` and `u7`, ensuring no PII is processed.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas
- **Data Presence**: If the required parameters in `eventPayload` (like `Brand` or `FirstPartyCookie`) are missing, the relevant user variables will not be set in the datalayer.
- **Variable Naming Conflicts**: Ensure that variable names used in the `pl` object do not conflict with other extensions that might be active in the same scope.
- **Performance**: Extensive mapping and filtering might introduce performance overhead; testing is recommended for high-throughput scenarios.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring
- **Modularisation**: Consider breaking down the mapping and filtering logic into smaller functions to improve readability and maintainability.
- **Consistent Coding Style**: Maintain consistent use of spacing and comments to enhance code clarity. Each major block could benefit from comments describing its intent.
- **Defensive Checks**: Although it is not necessary to handle `eventType` and `eventPayload`, adding checks or validations for values can prevent unexpected errors and improve robustness.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes
- **Ownership**: Assign a specific team member or role responsible for the ongoing maintenance of this extension.
- **Testing**: Regularly run unit tests on the extension with various payload scenarios to assure that all logic paths perform as expected and to catch any regressions.
- **Documentation Updates**: Any changes to the extension should be accompanied by updates to this documentation to ensure its relevance and correctness.
