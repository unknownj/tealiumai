# EventStream uvar Code Extension Documentation

This document provides an in‐depth explanation of the "EventStream uvar code" Tealium iQ extension including its purpose, internal logic, sample usage scenarios, known limitations, recommendations for improvement, and maintenance guidelines.

---

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** EventStream uvar code  
- **ID:** 1893 (Extension), 100036 (Library/Connector reference)  
- **Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** After Load Rules  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Always  

**Summary:**  
This extension collects a predefined set of data variables (mapped from the Event Payload) into an object for use by the Floodlight connector. It creates two arrays—one for variable names and one for the corresponding values. Additionally, the extension provides basic PII protection by filtering out any email addresses before passing the data along. It also respects the user's consent settings by removing certain sensitive values if cookies targeting consent is not given.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables

- **a & b:**  
  - These represent the two arguments passed to the anonymous function. Conventionally, `a` is the event type and `b` is the event payload object.

- **pl:**  
  - An object literal that acts as a mapping for the Floodlight connector.  
  - It pairs keys (e.g. U8, U1, U2, … U31) with values extracted from properties of the event payload (`b`).  
  - The mapping is specifically designed to capture different attributes such as brand, product group, journey details and other metadata.

- **clova3.datalayer:**  
  - A global object used to store the final arrays of variable names and variable values. This dependency is assumed to be available in the global context.

### Logic Flow

1. **Mapping Variables:**  
   The extension initialises an object (`pl`) that maps Floodlight u variable keys (e.g. U8, U1, etc.) to corresponding properties from the event payload (`b`). This creates one consolidated object containing the data required by the Floodlight connector.

2. **PII Filtering:**  
   The code iterates over each key in the `pl` object and checks if the value is a string.  
   - It uses string functions (specifically, checking for the presence of '@' or its URL-encoded form '%40') to identify potential PII (e.g. email addresses).  
   - If such patterns are found, the value is replaced with an empty string, effectively removing the data.

3. **Removal of Empty Values:**  
   A further iteration over the object is performed where any key holding a falsy value (undefined, null, or empty string) is deleted from `pl`.  
   - This cleanup ensures that the final arrays contain only those variables that are set with a meaningful value.

4. **Consent-Based Data Removal:**  
   The extension then checks if the cookie targeting consent is not provided (`b["CookiesTargeting"] !== true`).  
   - If consent is missing, it explicitly deletes certain keys (U8, U7, U28) from `pl`.  
   - This is a safeguard to ensure that sensitive identifiers are not passed on when the user has not consented.

5. **Extraction and Storage of Final Arrays:**  
   - The keys and values of the cleaned `pl` object are extracted using `Object.getOwnPropertyNames` and `Object.values`, respectively.  
   - These arrays are assigned to properties `b.uVariableNames` and `b.uVariableValues`.
   - Finally, these arrays are stored in the global `clova3.datalayer` using its `set` method, with a flag to indicate immediate persistence.

### Dependencies

- Relies on the availability of:
  - The `eventType` and `eventPayload` parameters, guaranteed by Tealium and provided to the function as `a` and `b`.
  - The global object `clova3.datalayer` for setting persistent data layer values.
- The code assumes that the event payload (`b`) contains properties named according to the expected mapping (e.g. `Brand`, `ProductGroup`).

## 3. Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Standard Event with Full Data

**Input:**  
An event payload `b` contains all required properties with valid string values, including values for email-like content in properties. Consent is given (`CookiesTargeting === true`).

**Process Flow:**
- The mapping object `pl` is populated with all provided values.
- If any string contains "@" or "%40", these values are reset to an empty string.
- All properties with empty (or falsy) values are removed.
- Consent check passes, so sensitive keys U8, U7, and U28 remain intact.
- The final arrays of variable names and values are stored in `b.uVariableNames` and `b.uVariableValues`, then added to `clova3.datalayer`.

**Output:**  
Arrays are available for downstream processing in Floodlight connector.

---

### Scenario 2: Event with Missing Values and PII Data

**Input:**  
The event payload `b` is missing some properties or provides empty strings. Some properties might contain email addresses or encoded email strings.

**Process Flow:**
- The mapping object `pl` is initialised, but some keys have undefined or falsy values.
- The loop removes any keys with undefined or falsy values.
- For keys holding string values with "@" or "%40", the values are cleared.
- If cookie targeting consent is not provided (`CookiesTargeting !== true`), sensitive keys U8, U7, U28 are deleted.
- The resulting arrays only include keys that have non-empty, non-sensitive values allowed by the consent settings.

**Output:**  
The resulting arrays reflect only non-PII, consistent, and consent-approved data fields.

---

### Scenario 3: Consent Not Given for Cookies Targeting

**Input:**  
Even if data exists for U8, U7, and U28, the event payload's property `CookiesTargeting` is false or not true.

**Process Flow:**
- After mapping and PII filtering, the consent check block removes U8, U7, and U28.
- This ensures any sensitive data associated with these keys is not passed on.

**Output:**  
Arrays omit the sensitive u variables which are not to be captured due to lack of consent.

---

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **PII Filtering:**  
  - The simplistic check for "@" and "%40" may not catch all cases of PII. For example, if sensitive data is obfuscated or does not contain these substrings, it might pass through.
  
- **Data Type Assumptions:**  
  - The code assumes that if a variable is a string, it supports the method `indexOf`. Any unexpected data format might lead to issues, though this is unlikely given the payload structure.

- **Deletion Loop:**  
  - The loop that deletes falsy values might remove properties that are valid but intentionally falsy (e.g. a value of 0).

- **Global Dependencies:**  
  - The use of a global data layer (`clova3.datalayer`) means that any changes to that object or its API could break this extension.
  - There is potential for conflicts if other extensions are attempting to process or modify the same data layer properties.

- **Consent Logic:**  
  - The removal of sensitive data only occurs if `CookiesTargeting` is not exactly true. If this consent flag's logic changes or is misconfigured elsewhere, it could lead to unintended data leaks.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Code Modularisation:**  
  - Consider breaking the code into discrete functions such as a dedicated function for PII filtering and another for consent-based deletion. This could improve readability and maintainability.

- **Error Handling:**  
  - While defensive checks for `eventType` and `eventPayload` are not required, consider adding logging or fallback mechanisms if unexpected data is encountered in production environments.

- **Iterative Cleanup Optimisation:**  
  - Instead of multiple loops (one for filtering, another for deletion), evaluate the possibility of combining these into a single loop for efficiency, ensuring not to compromise readability.

- **Variable Naming:**  
  - Use more descriptive variable names instead of `a`, `b`, and `pl` to enhance code clarity for future developers. For example, consider naming parameters `eventType` and `payload` and renaming `pl` to something like `floodlightParams`.

- **Documentation:**  
  - Add inline comments to clarify complex logic, especially around the consent handling and PII filtering mechanisms.

- **Testing Enhancements:**  
  - Introduce unit tests for the PII filtering and consent logic parts; although this is a Tealium iQ extension, maintaining a reliable test suite can prevent regressions.

*Note:* All recommendations remain compliant with ES5 syntax as required.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  - Assign ownership of this extension to a specific team or developer who is familiar with both the Floodlight connector data requirements and Tealium iQ customisations.
  - Regularly review the extension to ensure it aligns with any updates to data privacy regulations, especially those related to PII handling.

- **Version Control:**  
  - Maintain the code in a version control system with detailed change logs (e.g. Git) to facilitate rollback if unexpected behaviour is observed after changes.

- **Testing & Validation:**  
  - Develop a testing plan that includes scenarios for normal events, events with missing or malformed data, and cases with consent not given.
  - Consider using a staging environment in Tealium iQ before deploying changes to production.

- **Documentation Updates:**  
  - Update this documentation whenever any changes are made to the extension. This ensures that developers and stakeholders are aware of current behaviour and any edge-case handling.

- **Review Dependencies:**  
  - Periodically verify the availability and behaviour of global dependencies (e.g. clova3.datalayer) to ensure they remain compatible as other parts of the ecosystem evolve.
