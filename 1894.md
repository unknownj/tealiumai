# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation

## Extension Overview
- **Name**: Mortgages Triggerview
- **ID**: 100036
- **Type**: Javascript Code
- **Scope**: After Tag Extensions
- **Execution Frequency**: Run Always

### Summary
This extension is designed to trigger a specific view event, "QuickRateCheck Deals 2", through the LBGAnalytics system when a user interacts with the QuickRateCheck Deals journey step. The use of `setTimeout` provides a delay of 200 milliseconds before the event is triggered, ensuring that it captures the user's action appropriately. This extension enhances tracking capabilities for better insights into user behaviour and engagement during this step of the mortgage application process.

## Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- `a`: Represents an event type (expected to be "view").
- `b`: An object that contains journey data, specifically `JourneyStepName`.

### Logic Flow
1. The extension checks whether the `a` variable is equal to "view" and if the `JourneyStepName` property of the `b` object equals "QuickRateCheck Deals".
2. If both conditions are satisfied, a `setTimeout` function executes after a delay of 200 milliseconds.
3. Within the `setTimeout`, a try-catch block is used to invoke the LBGAnalytics trigger for the event "QuickRateCheck Deals 2". The catch block is written to ignore any errors without additional handling.

### Dependencies
- This extension relies on the `LBGAnalytics` global object for tracking events. It is assumed that this object will be available in the global context when the extension runs.

## Usage Examples

### Normal Condition
- When a user enters the Journey Step named "QuickRateCheck Deals" and data is captured for the event type "view", the extension will successfully trigger the view event "QuickRateCheck Deals 2" after a 200 ms delay.

### Edge Conditions
- If the `a` variable is something other than "view" or if the `JourneyStepName` is not "QuickRateCheck Deals", the code will not execute any tracking action. The extension will remain idle.

## Known Limitations & Gotchas
- No explicit feedback mechanism is present in case of a failure to trigger the analytics eventâ€”errors will be silently ignored.
- If `LBGAnalytics` is not properly loaded before this extension runs, the tracking event will not be triggered, possibly leading to missed user interactions.
- Conflicts may arise if other extensions modify or override the global `LBGAnalytics` object or if multiple extensions attempt to invoke similar triggers in quick succession.

## Recommendations for Refactoring
- **Defensive Checks**: Although it is required to support ES5, consider adding checks to ensure `b` and `b.JourneyStepName` exist before accessing them. This could prevent potential runtime errors.
  
  Example:
  ```javascript
  if (a === "view" && b && typeof b.JourneyStepName === "string" && b.JourneyStepName === "QuickRateCheck Deals") {
      // Proceed with triggering the event
  }
  ```

- **Code Style**: Maintain consistent indentation and spacing for better readability. For instance, the `try-catch` block should be properly spaced.
  
- **Modularization**: Wrap the triggering logic in a function. This approach would enhance reusability and make future modifications easier.

## Maintenance & Further Notes
- **Ongoing Maintenance**: Regularly review the extension to ensure compatibility with updates to the LBGAnalytics library.
- **Ownership**: Assign a specific team or individual for managing and updating this extension, ensuring expertise is maintained.
- **Testing Guidelines**: Implement a testing strategy to validate the functionality of this extension in different scenarios (e.g., various journey step names, absence of the LBGAnalytics object) to ensure it behaves as expected under all conditions.
