# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name**: Mortgages Triggerview
- **ID**: 100036
- **Type**: Javascript Code
- **Scope**: After Tag Extensions
- **Execution Frequency**: Run Always

### Summary
The "Mortgages Triggerview" extension is designed to trigger an analytics event specifically for the "QuickRateCheck Deals" journey step. When the specified conditions are met, it invokes a function from the LBGAnalytics library to track this event after a short delay. This is beneficial for monitoring user engagement and interactions with mortgage offerings on a website.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- **a**: A variable that holds the event type that is checked against the string "view".
- **b**: An object that contains context-related data, particularly `JourneyStepName` which is checked for the value "QuickRateCheck Deals".

### Logic Flow
1. The extension first evaluates whether the variable `a` equals "view" and if the `JourneyStepName` property of object `b` matches "QuickRateCheck Deals".
2. If both conditions are true, a `setTimeout` function is initiated with a delay of 200 milliseconds.
3. Within the `setTimeout`, an attempt is made to invoke the `triggerView` method from the `LBGAnalytics` object, passing the string "QuickRateCheck Deals 2" as an argument.
4. If an error occurs during the invocation, it is caught by a `try-catch` block, and the code continues to execute without interruption (as the catch block contains no action).

### Dependencies
- **LBGAnalytics**: This is a global object assumed to be available in the environment, specifically its `triggerView` method that is used to track page views.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Normal Execution
- **Input**: `{a: "view", b: {JourneyStepName: "QuickRateCheck Deals"}}`
- **Behaviour**: The extension triggers `LBGAnalytics.triggerView` with "QuickRateCheck Deals 2" after a 200ms delay.

### Scenario 2: Edge Condition - Condition Not Met
- **Input**: `{a: "view", b: {JourneyStepName: "Other Deals"}}`
- **Behaviour**: No action is taken as the conditions are not satisfied.

### Scenario 3: Edge Condition - Not a View
- **Input**: `{a: "click", b: {JourneyStepName: "QuickRateCheck Deals"}}`
- **Behaviour**: No action is taken because `a` does not equal "view".

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Timing Issues**: The execution of the analytics call is delayed by 200ms. This could potentially cause the event to be missed if the user navigates away from the page before the timeout completes.
- **Error Handling**: While errors in the `triggerView` invocation are caught silently, it may lead to untraceable issues. It's crucial to log errors or maintain visibility on analytics failures.
- **Global Dependency**: Relying on the availability of the `LBGAnalytics` object without checks could lead to issues if the library is not included on the page or initialized correctly.
- **Potential Conflicts**: If other extensions or scripts modify the global `LBGAnalytics` object or interfere with the event model, it could lead to unexpected behaviour.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Modularisation**: Consider breaking the logic into smaller functions for easier readability and maintenance, although this must be done while adhering to ES5 standards.
- **Error Logging**: Implement an error logging mechanism within the catch block to capture any invocation failures of `LBGAnalytics.triggerView` for troubleshooting.
- **Guard Clauses**: Before invoking `LBGAnalytics.triggerView`, check if it is defined to ensure that the extension does not fail due to missing dependencies:
    ```javascript
    if (typeof LBGAnalytics !== "undefined" && LBGAnalytics.triggerView) {
        LBGAnalytics.triggerView.invoke("QuickRateCheck Deals 2");
    }
    ```
- **Comments**: Although comments exist, adding more detailed comments within the code, especially describing the purpose of key operations, would assist in understanding the logic.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ownership**: Assign a developer responsible for maintaining and updating this extension when necessary.
- **Testing Guidelines**: Continuously test the extension in various scenarios, especially after updates to the LBGAnalytics library or the introduction of new related features.
- **Documentation Updates**: Ensure that this documentation remains current with any changes made to the codebase or business requirements regarding the mortgage journey.

This careful approach ensures that developers or stakeholders can easily comprehend and utilise this extension for effective analytics tracking.
