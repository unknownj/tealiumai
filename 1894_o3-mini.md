# Mortgages Triggerview Extension Documentation

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Mortgages Triggerview  
- **Extension ID:** 1894 (Internal ID), with an additional identifier 100036 from the Tealium configuration  
- **Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** After Tag Extensions  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Always (i.e. the code executes every time the extension is invoked)

**Summary:**  
This extension listens for a specific condition where the event type equals "view" and the `JourneyStepName` property (found on object `b`) is set to "QuickRateCheck Deals". When this condition is true, it waits 200 milliseconds before attempting to trigger an additional view event. The secondary view event is triggered using the external `LBGAnalytics.triggerView.invoke` method with the label "QuickRateCheck Deals 2". This approach is likely used for capturing a secondary analytics event following a particular user journey step, thereby allowing downstream tracking or segmentation based on that event.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables:
- **a:** A global variable expected to hold the event type. The code checks if its value is "view".
- **b:** A global object that includes various properties related to the event payload. In this instance, it must contain a property named `JourneyStepName`.
- **LBGAnalytics:** An external global object that includes an analytics method for triggering events. The method used is `triggerView.invoke`.

### Logic Flow:
1. **Condition Check:**  
   The code initiates by checking if `a` equals the string "view" and whether the property `JourneyStepName` on object `b` equals "QuickRateCheck Deals".
   
2. **Delayed Execution:**  
   If the conditions are met, a `setTimeout` function delays further execution by 200 milliseconds. This delay may serve to ensure that the necessary context or a previous event processing has completed.

3. **Attempt to Trigger an Analytic Event:**  
   Within the `setTimeout` callback, the code attempts to execute `LBGAnalytics.triggerView.invoke("QuickRateCheck Deals 2")`. This call is wrapped in a try-catch block so that in the event of an error (for example, if `LBGAnalytics` is undefined or the method invocation fails), the code will catch the error and silently ignore it (logging or further failure handling is not implemented).

### Dependencies:
- **Global Objects:**  
  The code relies on the existence of global variables `a` and `b` to function correctly.  
- **External Library:**  
  The extension uses `LBGAnalytics`, which must be available in the global scope. The absence of `LBGAnalytics` or its `triggerView.invoke` method could lead to errors, though these errors are caught and swallowed.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Normal Condition
- **Input:**  
  - `a` is set to "view".  
  - `b` is an object with `b.JourneyStepName` equal to "QuickRateCheck Deals".  
- **Behaviour:**  
  - The conditions are met and after a 200ms delay, the extension triggers the view using `LBGAnalytics.triggerView.invoke("QuickRateCheck Deals 2")`.
  
### Scenario 2: Edge Condition with Incorrect Event Type
- **Input:**  
  - `a` is set to a value other than "view" (for example "click").  
  - `b` may or may not contain the property `JourneyStepName`.  
- **Behaviour:**  
  - The initial condition will not be satisfied, and no further processing (no delay or invocation) occurs.

### Scenario 3: Edge Condition with Incorrect JourneyStepName
- **Input:**  
  - `a` is "view".  
  - `b.JourneyStepName` is something other than "QuickRateCheck Deals".  
- **Behaviour:**  
  - The conditional check fails and the analytics event is not triggered.

### Scenario 4: External Dependency Failure
- **Input:**  
  - Conditions are met.  
  - However, if `LBGAnalytics` is undefined or if `triggerView.invoke` is missing, the code will throw an error inside the try block.  
- **Behaviour:**  
  - Thanks to the try-catch block, the error is caught and ignored, and no further action is taken. This ensures that the error does not propagate further, although it may lead to a missing analytics event.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Dependency on Global Variables:**  
  The extension assumes that the global variables `a` and `b` are defined and contain the expected properties. Any deviation may lead to conditions never being met.

- **Reliance on External Analytics Object:**  
  If `LBGAnalytics` or the method `triggerView.invoke` is not available due to external script load failures or timing issues, the extension will silently fail (error is swallowed). This may lead to missing analytics data.

- **Asynchronous Execution with setTimeout:**  
  The fixed 200ms delay may not be sufficient in some cases if the environment is under heavy load or if other asynchronous processes are delayed. This could result in a race condition if the analytic event is sent too early or not at all.

- **Error Handling:**  
  The try-catch block is very general. Any error during the invocation is completely ignored, reducing the ability to diagnose issues during debugging or in production logging.

- **Potential Conflicts:**  
  As this extension runs in the "After Tag Extensions" scope, there is a possibility of conflict with other extensions that also trigger analytics calls. Coordination with all dependent systems is necessary to manage multiple triggers for similar events.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Improve Error Handling:**  
  Currently, the catch block does not provide any error logging. Consider incorporating a logging mechanism (if available) to record when errors occur. This can aid in debugging issues in production.

- **Modularise the Code:**  
  Extract the conditional check and the analytics trigger into separate functions. This can improve readability and facilitate unit testing.

- **Ensure Global Dependencies:**  
  It might be beneficial to add checks to confirm that global objects (`a`, `b`, `LBGAnalytics`) exist before attempting to access them, even though the provided guarantee for eventType and eventPayload exists. Nonetheless, for completeness in long-term maintenance, ensuring that these dependencies load correctly can be helpful.

- **Document Magic Values:**  
  The 200ms delay is a magic number. Adding a comment or a configuration parameter for the delay duration could clarify its purpose and make it easier to adjust if future timing issues are identified.

- **Synchronise Triggering with Other Extensions:**  
  Evaluate whether the delayed invocation might conflict with other extensions. If multiple extensions use similar delays, consider a unified timing mechanism or choreography to avoid race conditions.

*Note:* Despite the recommendations above, remember that the project requires that ES5 is supported. As such, avoid using ES2015 features like arrow functions or let/const when refactoring the code.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ownership:**  
  Assign a clearly identified owner or a team responsible for maintaining the extension. Ensure that any changes to analytics tracking, event flow, or external dependencies are communicated to all stakeholders.

- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Unit tests should be written to validate the logic for conditions where an event should or should not trigger the analytics call.
  - Consider integration tests that simulate the existence or absence of the `LBGAnalytics` global object.
  - Monitor the extension behaviour in a staging environment to assess whether the delay and trigger perform reliably under varying loads.

- **Documentation Updates:**  
  Keep this documentation updated with any code changes, especially if the conditions or the external dependency details change over time. Adding inline comments within the code can also help future developers understand the purpose of the 200ms delay and the rationale behind the try-catch implementation.

- **Future Enhancements:**  
  Consider logging the error message inside the catch block in a controlled manner so that debugging information is available without impacting production performance. Also, evaluating the benefits of making delay duration configurable may be worthwhile if environment timings vary widely.
