# Report Suite Overrides Extension Documentation

This document provides comprehensive details on the Report Suite Overrides Tealium iQ extension. It covers an extension overview, code explanation, example usage scenarios, known limitations, refactoring recommendations, and maintenance guidelines.

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Report Suite Overrides  
- **Extension ID:** 1895  
- **Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** After Load Rules  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Always  

**Summary:**  
The Report Suite Overrides extension evaluates conditions based on the values in the event payload (primarily the Brand and JourneyName properties). Based on the matching conditions, it sets the ReportSuiteOverride property with specific comma-separated report suite values. This facilitates dynamic targeting of report suites based on brand or journey criteria.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- **eventType:** The first argument passed into the self-executing function. Although not used in the logic, it is provided by Tealium.
- **eventPayload (referred as "b" in the code):** A global object containing various properties associated with the event (e.g. Brand, JourneyName).

### Logic Flow
1. **Try/Catch Block for Brand Conditions:**  
   - The code attempts to process the Brand property from the event payload.
   - It converts the Brand to lower-case, removes spaces, and then checks if the resulting string contains specific substrings.
     - If the Brand contains "lexautoloease", it sets ReportSuiteOverride to `"lloydsbankinggroupprod,lloydsbankinggroupmotor"`.
     - Likewise, if the Brand contains "blackhorse", it assigns the same override value.
   - Any error occurring during this block will be silently caught in the catch block (with a simple comment "// never mind").

2. **Conditional Check on JourneyName:**  
   - Independently of the brand check, the code further examines the JourneyName property.
   - If JourneyName exists and its lower-case representation contains "investmentadvised", the ReportSuiteOverride is set to `"lloydsbankinggroupprod"`, potentially overriding any previous setting from the Brand conditions.

3. **Dependencies:**  
   - The code depends on the globally available eventType (a string) and eventPayload (an object) provided by Tealium.
   - It utilises standard ES5 JavaScript methods such as toLowerCase(), split(), join(), and indexOf() for string manipulation and checking.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Brand Match (Lex Auto Lease)
- **Input:**  
  eventPayload.Brand = "Lex Auto Lease"  
- **Process:**  
  - "Lex Auto Lease" is converted to "lexautololease" after lowering case and removing spaces.  
  - The condition `indexOf("lexautoloease") >= 0` is met.
- **Output:**  
  eventPayload.ReportSuiteOverride will be set to `"lloydsbankinggroupprod,lloydsbankinggroupmotor"`.

### Scenario 2: Brand Match (Black Horse)
- **Input:**  
  eventPayload.Brand = "Black Horse"  
- **Process:**  
  - Processing converts "Black Horse" to "blackhorse", matching the condition.
- **Output:**  
  eventPayload.ReportSuiteOverride is set to `"lloydsbankinggroupprod,lloydsbankinggroupmotor"`.

### Scenario 3: JourneyName Override
- **Input:**  
  eventPayload.JourneyName = "InvestmentAdvisedPlan"
- **Process:**  
  - The JourneyName string is lowered to "investmentadvisedplan" and the condition is met.
- **Output:**  
  eventPayload.ReportSuiteOverride is set to `"lloydsbankinggroupprod"`, regardless of any previous Brand match.

### Scenario 4: Edge Case with No Matching Conditions
- **Input:**  
  eventPayload.Brand = "Some Other Brand"  
  eventPayload.JourneyName is either undefined or does not contain "investmentadvised".
- **Output:**  
  The ReportSuiteOverride property remains unchanged (or undefined) as no conditions are satisfied.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Overriding of Conditions:**  
  - If both a Brand condition and the JourneyName condition are met, the JourneyName condition will override the ReportSuiteOverride set by the Brand logic since it runs later in the script.
- **String Manipulation Approach:**  
  - The technique of converting the Brand value to lower-case and stripping spaces works for the intended substrings but may be prone to false positives or miss variations if there are unexpected characters or typos.
- **Silent Error Handling:**  
  - The try/catch block silently swallows errors. This might make debugging more challenging if unexpected issues occur during the string processing.
- **Dependency on Event Data Format:**  
  - The extension assumes that eventPayload.Brand and eventPayload.JourneyName, when present, are strings. Any deviation from this expected data format might cause the conditions to fail.

- **Potential Conflicts:**  
  - If other Tealium extensions or external scripts modify eventPayload.ReportSuiteOverride in the same lifecycle stage ("After Load Rules"), there could be conflicts or unpredictable override behaviour.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Improve Readability and Modularity:**  
  - Consider encapsulating the brand processing logic into a helper function that takes the Brand string as a parameter and returns the desired report suite value. This would enhance readability and maintainability.
  
- **Enhanced Error Logging:**  
  - Instead of silently ignoring exceptions in the catch block, it might be beneficial to log errors to a debug console (if available) or implement a conditional logging mechanism to aid troubleshooting.

- **Order of Evaluation:**  
  - Document and verify the order in which conditions should apply. If the JourneyName condition should always override the Brand condition, this behaviour must be clearly documented and considered in any future changes.

- **Code Comments and Documentation:**  
  - Add inline comments to explain the rationale behind string transformations and condition checks, making the code easier for future developers to understand.

- **Maintaining ES5 Compatibility:**  
  - Continue to use ES5 syntax to ensure compatibility as required. Avoid introducing ES2015 features such as arrow functions, template literals, and let/const declarations.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  - Regularly review this extension's logic to ensure that the conditions and overrides remain aligned with business requirements.
  - Monitor for any changes in the format or structure of eventPayload data that might affect the extension's behaviour.

- **Ownership:**  
  - Assign a dedicated developer or team to maintain and update this extension. Keep track of any modifications via version control within Tealium.

- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Include unit tests in your QA process to simulate various input scenarios (e.g. different values for Brand and JourneyName) and verify that the ReportSuiteOverride is set as expected.
  - Ensure regression testing is a part of any deployment process that includes changes to this extension to avoid unintended consequences.

- **Documentation Updates:**  
  - Update this documentation should any changes be made to the extension logic. Keep changelogs or commit messages that indicate the reason for updates to help track modifications over time.
