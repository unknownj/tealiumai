# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: CWR Fix

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name**: CWR Fix
- **ID**: 1896
- **Type**: Javascript Code
- **Scope**: DOM Ready
- **Execution Frequency**: Run Once

### Summary
The **CWR Fix** extension is designed to modify the behaviour of the `LBGAnalytics` event sending method when the user is on a specific path that includes "cwr-hub". The extension ensures that events are queued and sent with a delay, preventing multiple rapid sends of the same data. This is useful for managing event throughput and ensuring that data is correctly processed without overwhelming the analytics infrastructure.

---

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- `LBGAnalytics.events._send`: This variable stores the original `send` method from the `LBGAnalytics.events` object.
- `LBGAnalytics.events._sendTimeout`: A variable that holds a reference to a timeout, allowing for debouncing of `send` calls.

### Logic Flow
1. The extension checks the current webpage path using `window.location.pathname`. If the path includes "cwr-hub", the code proceeds to override the existing `send` method.
2. The original `send` method is preserved in `_send` for later use.
3. A new `send` function is defined, which:
   - Logs a message indicating that the send function has been overridden.
   - Converts incoming arguments into an array for processing.
   - If a previous timeout exists, it clears that timeout to prevent redundant event sends.
   - If arguments are provided, it sends the event immediately using the original `_send` method.
   - If no arguments are present, it initiates a timeout of 1000 milliseconds to send the event only if no new calls are made in that duration.

### Dependencies
- The code relies on the global object `LBGAnalytics`, specifically the `events` object within it for handling analytics events. There are no additional external libraries used.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Sample Scenario 1: Normal Flow
1. A user navigates to a page with the URL containing "cwr-hub".
2. An event is triggered by the application, calling `LBGAnalytics.events.send(data)`.
3. The `CWR Fix` extension overrides the original `send` method, logging that the send operation is modified.
4. Since arguments are present, the event is sent immediately.

### Sample Scenario 2: Rapid Succession Calls
1. A user performs actions that trigger multiple analytics events in quick succession on the "cwr-hub" page.
2. Each call to `send` results in the extension logging the message about clearing the previous timeout for event sends.
3. Only the last `send` call will actually execute after a delay of 1000 milliseconds, effectively debouncing the event submissions.

### Edge Condition: No Arguments
1. If an event is triggered without arguments, the system logs a message and sets a timeout.
2. If no further events are sent within 1000 milliseconds, the system will execute the `send` method without any arguments, logging that the send is occurring ‘for real’.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Path Dependency**: This extension only functions when the URL includes "cwr-hub". If the path does not match, no modifications will be made to the `send` method.
- **Timeout Behaviour**: If the send method is invoked frequently, only the last event will be sent after a 1000 ms timeout, potentially losing other events that were triggered in rapid succession.
- **Interference with Other Extensions**: If other extensions also modify `LBGAnalytics.events.send`, there may be unexpected behaviour due to conflicting overrides.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Error Handling**: Although defensive coding around `eventType` and `eventPayload` is not necessary, consider adding logging around critical operations to facilitate easier debugging.
- **Code Style**: Maintain consistent indentation and spacing for readability. Use descriptive log messages to clarify what happens during each stage of execution.
- **Modularisation**: If the code grows, consider encapsulating the logic of sending events into smaller functions to improve maintainability.
- **Commenting**: Add comments explaining the purpose of each significant block, especially around timeout management and event handling.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ownership**: Assign a dedicated developer to oversee the extension's workflow and updates, ensuring that any necessary changes in `LBGAnalytics` are reflected in this extension.
- **Testing Guidelines**: Ensure comprehensive testing across various browsers and environments, particularly focusing on the event capture and send behaviour. Use console logs to verify the correct flow of events.
- **Documentation Updates**: Keep this documentation up to date with any changes made to the extension code in the future. Review the provided information regularly to ensure accuracy.
