# Eventstream abort flag Extension Documentation

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Eventstream abort flag  
- **ID:** 1899  
- **Extension ID:** 100036  
- **Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** After Load Rules  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Always  

**Summary:**  
This extension monitors and controls the firing of tags by setting an abort flag for FPHD (First Party Hosted Data) duplicates. Its main objective is to prevent duplicate server-side events for specific brands (i.e. LLOYDS and HALIFAX) by checking session storage for previous occurrences of a Pegasus tag fire. Depending on whether a duplicate is detected or not, the abort flag is set accordingly ("Y" for abort, "N" for proceed, and blank as a reset/default state). All the related variables are updated across different objects (the payload object, utag data, and a custom data layer managed by clova3).

--------------------------------------------------

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables & Functions

- **eventType & eventPayload:**  
  The function accepts two parameters. The first is a string (`eventType`) and the second is an object (`eventPayload`). They are used to determine the context (here checking if the event is a "view") and subsequently process data.

- **setAbortf Function:**  
  A helper function declared within the main IIFE. It accepts a single parameter (`flg`) and sets the abort flag for three destinations:
  - Updates `eventPayload` by setting property `"FPHDAbortFlg"`.
  - Updates the global Tealium data object (`utag.data.FPHDAbortFlg`).
  - Uses a custom data layer (`clova3.datalayer.set`).

### Logic Flow

1. **Event Type Check:**  
   The outer function checks if the event type is `"view"`. Processing occurs only during view events.

2. **Brand Check:**  
   The code tests if the brand (from `utag.data.Brand`) matches either "LLOYDS" or "HALIFAX". The brand string is converted to upper case to ensure the check is case-insensitive.

3. **Reset Flag:**  
   On page load, the abort flag is reset to an empty string (blank) to ensure no persisted value from prior sessions affects current behaviour.

4. **Abort Flag Existence:**  
   It verifies if the abort flag is absent or blank:
   - If the flag does not exist or is empty, the code proceeds to check session storage.

5. **Session Storage & FPHD Log Check:**  
   - The extension checks whether session storage is available.
   - It then attempts to retrieve an item named `"FPHDLog"` from session storage which tracks previous FPHD values.
   - If the FPHD log exists, the current Pegasus tag name (from `utag.data.PegasusTagName`) is compared with the cached log:
     - **Duplicate Check:**  
       If a match is found, the abort flag is set to `"Y"`, signalling that the tag fire should be aborted.
     - **No Duplicate:**  
       If there is no match, the current Pegasus tag name is added to the FPHD log (using a string concatenation with a separator `" ; "`), provided that either `window.fphdLog.E` or `window.fphdLog.P` is flagged as true. The abort flag is then set to `"N"`.
   - If the FPHD log does not exist, it is created with the current Pegasus tag name if the conditions on `window.fphdLog` are met, and the abort flag is set to `"N"`.

### Dependencies on Global Objects/Libraries

- **utag.data:**  
  The global data object provided by Tealium iQ which holds key-value pairs relevant to the current page view and event.

- **clova3.datalayer:**  
  A custom data layer object that is used to synchronise the abort flag within additional systems or frameworks.

- **window.fphdLog:**  
  A global object expected to have boolean flags (`E` and `P`) used as conditions before updating the session storage FPHD log.

- **sessionStorage:**  
  Browser's sessionStorage is utilised to persist a log of FPHD events within the session, thereby preventing duplicate tag firings.

--------------------------------------------------

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Scenario
- **User views a page:**  
  The extension is triggered with event type `"view"`.  
  - For a brand value like `"Lloyds Banking Group"` (converted to uppercase matching "LLOYDS"), the abort flag is initially reset.
  - The session storage is checked:
    - **First Visit:**  
      No FPHD log is present; the current Pegasus tag will be stored in session storage, and the abort flag is set to `"N"`, allowing the tag to fire.
    - **Subsequent Visit with the Same Pegasus Tag:**  
      The FPHD log now contains the tag name. If the same tag name is encountered again, a duplicate is detected, and the abort flag is set to `"Y"`.

### Edge Conditions
- **Brand Not Matching:**  
  If the brand does not include “LLOYDS” or “HALIFAX”, the code within the if-block is skipped, hence the abort flag is not modified.
  
- **Missing Session Storage:**  
  In environments where sessionStorage is not available, the internal logic checking or setting the FPHD log will be bypassed.
  
- **Inconsistent Global Object State:**  
  If `window.fphdLog` does not contain a valid `E` or `P` value (i.e. both are false or undefined), even on a first visit, session storage will not be updated, and no abort flag is set to `"N"` despite the absence of duplicates.

--------------------------------------------------

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Reliance on Session Storage:**  
  If sessionStorage is disabled or restricted (e.g., in incognito modes or due to browser policies), the mechanism to track duplicates will fail, potentially leading to repeated tag fires.

- **Global Object Dependency:**  
  The extension expects `utag.data`, `clova3.datalayer`, and `window.fphdLog` to be present and correctly formatted. Any changes to these globals or their removal can break the logic.

- **String Matching for Duplicates:**  
  The duplicate checking relies on simple string matching using the indexOf method. This might lead to false positives if the string values partially match.

- **Overwrite Bug in Condition Check:**  
  The condition checking for the existence/emptiness of `b["FPHDAbortFlg"]` uses the assignment operator instead of comparing equality (`(b["FPHDAbortFlg"] = "")` instead of `(b["FPHDAbortFlg"] === "")`). This could lead to unintended behaviours or bugs when evaluating the abort flag.

--------------------------------------------------

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks:**  
  Although eventType and eventPayload are guaranteed, consider defensive coding around other externally set objects (utag.data, clova3.datalayer, window.fphdLog) to ensure that their properties exist before accessing them.

- **Correct Conditional Operators:**  
  Review and fix the condition checking the abort flag. The assignment operator should be corrected to a comparison operator to prevent accidental overwrite:
  - Change from:  
    if ((!b["FPHDAbortFlg"]) || (b["FPHDAbortFlg"] = "")) {  
    - To:  
    if ((!b["FPHDAbortFlg"]) || (b["FPHDAbortFlg"] === "")) {

- **Modularisation:**  
  Consider extracting repeated logic (such as sessionStorage checks and FPHD log handling) into separate helper functions to improve readability and maintainability.

- **Comment Clarity:**  
  Improve code comments to explain the intent of checks (such as explaining why specific brands or the FPHD log conditions are used).

- **Code Readability:**  
  Even though ES5 is required, grouping logically related blocks and clear indentation will help future developers quickly understand the flow.

--------------------------------------------------

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  - Regularly audit dependency objects (`utag.data`, `clova3.datalayer`, `window.fphdLog`) to ensure they remain compliant with the extension’s expectations.
  - Test the extension across various browsers and different session settings to validate sessionStorage behaviour.
  - Monitor and log any errors or unexpected behaviour via browser console logs to catch issues early.

- **Ownership & Testing:**  
  - Assign a dedicated owner or team for the maintenance of custom tracking methods in the Tealium iQ setup.
  - Include this extension in regression test suites to ensure that changes in the external environment or other modifications in Tealium iQ do not interfere with its functionality.
  - Prepare unit tests for the function logic (where possible using ES5 compatible testing frameworks) to simulate different scenarios (first visit, duplicate visit, brand mismatch, sessionStorage unavailability).

- **Documentation Updates:**  
  - Update this documentation if any changes are made to the extension's logic.
  - Maintain a history of changes alongside version control to track modifications over time.

This documentation should provide clear guidance for developers and stakeholders on the structure, functionality, potential failure points, and improvement strategies for the "Eventstream abort flag" extension.
