# Cookie Audit Extension Documentation

This document provides an in-depth explanation of the Cookie Audit Tealium iQ extension. It covers the purpose of the extension, a detailed breakdown of its code, example usage scenarios, known limitations, recommendations for refactoring, and guidelines for ongoing maintenance.

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Cookie Audit  
- **Extension ID:** 1906  
- **Extension Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** 928  
- **Execution Frequency:** Executed each time the extension is triggered within the Tealium iQ tag execution process  

### Summary

The Cookie Audit extension is designed to inspect the current document cookies and randomly select one cookie name. This random selection process utilises the built-in Math.random() function to generate a random index corresponding to the list of cookie names found in the document. The resulting cookie name is then assigned to a property (CookieAuditName) accessible on a provided object.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables and Global Dependencies

- **Input Parameters:**  
  - `eventType` (string) – Represents the type of the event triggering the extension.  
  - `eventPayload` (object) – Holds additional information regarding the event.  
  - `tagObject` (referred to as `b` in the function) – An object that is used to expose or store values (in this case, the selected cookie name).

- **Global Objects and Methods:**  
  - `document.cookie` – Used to access the browser's cookies.  
  - `Math.random()` – Provides a random floating-point number used to determine the cookie index.

### Logic Flow

1. **Function Invocation:**  
   The anonymous function immediately invokes itself with the parameters `(eventType, eventPayload, tagObject)`.

2. **CookieAuditName Assignment:**  
   Inside the function, the property `CookieAuditName` is defined on the object `b` (which refers to `tagObject`). Its value is determined by an immediately invoked inner function that accepts `Math.random` as its parameter (renamed to `random` for clarity).

3. **Cookie Splitting and Mapping:**  
   - The code starts by obtaining the complete cookie string via `document.cookie` and splits it into an array of individual cookies using `.split("; ")`.
   - It then applies the `map` function on the resulting array. Each element (`a`) is further split on the "=" character to extract just the cookie name (the first part before the "=").

4. **Random Cookie Selection:**  
   - A `filter` method is employed on the array of cookie names.  
   - The filter function receives three parameters:  
     - `e` – The current cookie name (though not used within the logic directly).  
     - `i` – The current index in the array.  
     - `a` – The entire array of cookie names.  
   - The filter condition compares the index `i` with `Math.floor(random * a.length)`. This essentially computes a random index based on the array length and selects the cookie name at that index.
   - The result is an array with at most one element—the one matching the randomly computed index.

5. **Final Value Extraction:**  
   - The `[0]` at the end of the expression extracts the first (and only) element from the filtered array.  
   - This value is then assigned to `b.CookieAuditName`.

### Dependencies on Global Objects or Libraries

- This extension relies on the global `document` object to access cookies.
- It also uses the built-in `Math` library (specifically `Math.random()` and `Math.floor()`).
- The external parameters `eventType`, `eventPayload`, and `tagObject` are provided by Tealium iQ and are assumed to be present and correctly initialised.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Example 1: Normal Condition

- **Scenario:**  
  The document has multiple cookies, e.g., `"session_id=abc123; user=JohnDoe; theme=dark"`.
  
- **Execution Flow:**  
  - The `document.cookie` string is split into `["session_id=abc123", "user=JohnDoe", "theme=dark"]`.
  - Mapping extracts the names: `["session_id", "user", "theme"]`.
  - Assuming `Math.random()` returns a value such that `Math.floor(random * 3)` equals 1, the cookie name `"user"` will be selected.
  - The property `CookieAuditName` on the `tagObject` is set to `"user"`.

### Example 2: Edge Condition – Single Cookie

- **Scenario:**  
  The document contains a single cookie, e.g., `"logged_in=true"`.
  
- **Execution Flow:**  
  - The `document.cookie` string is split into an array with one element: `["logged_in=true"]`.
  - Mapping produces `["logged_in"]`.
  - No matter what random value is generated, the only valid index is 0, so `"logged_in"` is picked.
  - The property `CookieAuditName` becomes `"logged_in"`.

### Example 3: Edge Condition – No Cookies

- **Scenario:**  
  The document has no cookies set, resulting in `document.cookie` being an empty string.
  
- **Execution Flow:**  
  - Splitting an empty string results in `[""]` (an array with one empty string).
  - Mapping produces `[""]` (which might not be a meaningful cookie name).
  - Depending on the random selection, the extension may return an empty string.
  - Developers should be aware that this situation will not throw an error but might require additional handling if a valid cookie is mandatory.

---

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Empty or Invalid Cookie Strings:**  
  - When `document.cookie` is empty, the array after splitting contains a single empty string. This leads to an empty cookie name being selected.
  - There is no explicit check for whether the cookies are valid or non-empty.

- **Randomness Behaviour:**  
  - The use of `Math.random()` means that the output is non-deterministic. Repeated invocations can yield different results, which might cause inconsistencies if a stable value is needed.
  
- **Interference with Other Extensions:**  
  - Since the property is added to the `tagObject` (`b`), ensure that no other extensions overwrite or misuse the `CookieAuditName` property.
  - Any external scripts that modify `document.cookie` concurrently might affect the expected random selection.

- **Edge Cases with Cookie Formatting:**  
  - The logic assumes that cookies are formatted with a single "=" character. Cookies with unexpected formats could result in unintended behaviour.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks:**  
  - Although defensive coding for `eventType` and `eventPayload` is not required, consider adding checks to handle cases where `document.cookie` might be empty or contain only whitespace.
  - Validate the final selected cookie name to ensure it is not an empty string before assignment.

- **Modularisation:**  
  - Extract the cookie processing logic into separate functions if future enhancements are expected. This will improve readability and maintainability.
  - Consider naming functions and variables more descriptively to make the code self-explanatory.

- **Code Style Improvements (within ES5):**  
  - Use additional comments within the code to explain each step clearly.
  - Maintain consistent formatting and indentation to help future developers understand the logic.

- **Testing:**  
  - Develop unit tests that simulate various `document.cookie` scenarios (e.g. multiple cookies, a single cookie, no cookies, or malformed cookies).
  - Test the extension in the actual Tealium iQ environment to ensure that the `tagObject` correctly receives the `CookieAuditName` property.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ownership and Versioning:**  
  - Identify a maintainer familiar with both Tealium iQ and ES5 Javascript for ongoing support.
  - Keep this documentation updated with each change to the extension code.

- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Incorporate automated tests to verify that cookie splitting and random selection behave as expected.
  - Verify compatibility with all supported browsers, especially considering differences in how cookies may be handled.

- **Monitoring and Logging:**  
  - Although the current implementation is concise, consider adding logging (where permitted) to monitor the output in production. Logging should be minimal and only used for debugging purposes.

- **Future Enhancements:**  
  - As requirements evolve, consider expanding the audit to include more detailed cookie attributes (e.g. values or properties).
  - Any refactoring must continue to support ES5 to ensure compatibility with legacy browser environments.

By following these guidelines and understanding the flow of the Cookie Audit extension, developers and stakeholders can ensure it is both effective and maintainable in the long term.
