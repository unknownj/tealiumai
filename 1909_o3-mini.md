# Celebrus Load Trigger Documentation

This document provides a detailed explanation of the Celebrus Load Trigger Tealium iQ extension, including its purpose, code flow, usage examples, limitations, refactoring suggestions, and maintenance recommendations.

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Celebrus Load Trigger
- **ID:** 1909
- **Type:** Javascript Code
- **Scope:** After Load Rules
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Always

**Summary:**  
The Celebrus Load Trigger extension is designed to dynamically load specific external JavaScript assets based on URL query string parameters and/or existing cookies. By setting cookies when certain query string parameters are detected, the extension determines which remote script to load into the page. This enables conditional activation of different Celebrus scripts (e.g. development, preproduction, production, snippet) without modifying the core application code.

---

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables and Functions
- **Query String Parsing:**  
  The code checks the `window.location.search` string for the presence of various parameters such as:
  - `enableCelebrus=true`
  - `enableCelebrus=dev`
  - `enableCelebrus=preprod`
  - `enableCelebrus=prod`
  - `enableCelebrus=snippet`

- **Cookie Setting:**  
  Based on the detected query parameter, corresponding cookies are set to control the script loading mechanism:
  - Setting `document.cookie = "enableCelebrus=true";` if a match is found.
  - Similar logic is applied for the `dev`, `preprod`, `prod`, and `snippet` cases.

- **loadCelebrusWrapper Function:**  
  This function:
  - Sets a global flag `window.LBGCelebrusSDKUrl` to `true`, signalling that the Celebrus SDK is in use.
  - Dynamically creates a `<script>` element with its `src` property pointing to the Celebrus tagging script URL.
  - Appends the script element to the document’s `<body>` if it exists, or to the `<head>` otherwise.

### Main Logic Flow
1. **Cookie Overriding from URL:**  
   - The script first inspects the URL’s query string.  
   - For each valid query parameter (e.g. `?enableCelebrus=dev`), the corresponding cookie value is set.

2. **Script Loading Decision:**  
   - The code then evaluates `document.cookie` for the presence of one of the expected cookie values.
   - For cookies with values `enableCelebrus=true`, `dev`, `preprod`, or `prod`, it creates a `<script>` element pointing to different remote URLs based on the environment:
     - For **true**: Loads a script from `utag.1638.js`
     - For **dev**: Loads from `utag.1789.js`
     - For **preprod**: Loads from `utag.1790.js`
     - For **prod**: Loads from `utag.1791.js`
   - For the cookie value `snippet` or if the hostname starts with `"put0"` (with an alternative commented hint for `"sit0"`), it invokes the `loadCelebrusWrapper` function which dynamically loads a separate Celebrus tagging script.

3. **Global Objects and Dependencies:**
   - Uses global objects such as `window`, `document`, and `document.cookie`.
   - The extension assumes the availability of `eventType` and `eventPayload` at the closure's invocation, although they are not manipulated within this code.
   - There is no external library dependency beyond the remote scripts that are loaded.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Enabling Celebrus for Default Behaviour
- **URL:** `https://example.com/?enableCelebrus=true`
- **Process:**
  1. The extension searches the query string and finds `enableCelebrus=true`.
  2. Sets the cookie `enableCelebrus=true`.
  3. When evaluating cookies, the extension finds the `true` flag and appends a `<script>` element with the source URL:
     - `https://tags.tiqcdn.com/utag/lbg/main/dev/utag.1638.js`
- **Outcome:**  
  The designated script for the default environment is loaded into the `<head>`.

### Scenario 2: Enabling Celebrus for the Preproduction Environment
- **URL:** `https://example.com/?enableCelebrus=preprod`
- **Process:**
  1. The query string triggers a cookie being set to `enableCelebrus=preprod`.
  2. The code then appends a `<script>` element with the source URL:
     - `https://tags.tiqcdn.com/utag/lbg/main/dev/utag.1790.js`
- **Outcome:**  
  Pre-production specific Celebrus tagging script is loaded.

### Scenario 3: Using the Celebrus Snippet
- **URL:** `https://example.com/?enableCelebrus=snippet`
- **Process:**
  1. The query string sets the cookie to `enableCelebrus=snippet`.
  2. Instead of directly appending a script to the `<head>`, the `loadCelebrusWrapper` function is called.
  3. This function sets a global flag and then dynamically creates a `<script>` element loading:
     - `https://sit02-dlp-online-b.digital.lloydsbank.co.uk/personal/cwa/pec/celebrus-tagging/index.js`
- **Outcome:**  
  The Celebrus snippet is loaded, with the global flag indicating the script load.

### Scenario 4: Hostname Based Trigger
- **Host:** `put0.example.com`
- **Process:**
  1. If no relevant cookie is detected and the hostname starts with `"put0"`, `loadCelebrusWrapper()` is automatically triggered.
- **Outcome:**  
  The Celebrus SDK URL script is loaded even if the query string or cookies do not explicitly enable Celebrus.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Cookie Availability:**  
  The extension relies on the correct setting and reading of `document.cookie`. If cookies are disabled or blocked by the browser or user settings, the expected flows might not execute.

- **Script Injection Timing:**  
  - The extension attempts to append scripts to `document.body` (if available) before falling back to `document.head`.  
  - If the DOM is not fully parsed and neither `<body>` nor `<head>` is present at the time of execution, the script may not load as expected.

- **Hardcoded URLs:**  
  The script source URLs are hardcoded. Changes to the remote asset paths require manual updates to the code.

- **Conflict with Other Extensions:**  
  The extension runs "After Load Rules". If other extensions manipulate cookies or document structure (e.g. appending scripts), there is a potential for unexpected behaviour.

- **Global Dependency:**  
  The script sets a global variable (`window.LBGCelebrusSDKUrl`) which might conflict with other parts of the application if not carefully managed.

---

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Modularise Repeated Code:**  
  Consolidate the repeated creation and appending of `<script>` elements into a helper function that accepts a URL parameter. This will improve maintainability and reduce code duplication.

- **Defensive DOM Checks:**  
  While the current checks for the existence of `document.body` and `document.head` are functional, consider additional logging or error-handling routines to handle situations where both are not available.

- **Cookie Utility Function:**  
  Create a utility function for setting cookies to ensure consistency and easier modifications in the future.

- **Clarify Logic Flow with Comments:**  
  Introduce more inline comments explaining the purpose of each conditional block, especially around hostname-based triggers, to aid future developers.

- **Maintain ES5 Compatibility:**  
  Continue using ES5 syntax (e.g. anonymous functions, var declarations) as required by the project’s compatibility standards.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Testing:**  
  Regularly test the extension across different environments (development, preproduction, production) and browsers to ensure that cookies are set correctly and the respective scripts are loaded without error.

- **Ownership:**  
  Assign a dedicated team member or group responsible for monitoring updates to third-party script URLs and ensuring that the hardcoded endpoints remain valid.

- **Documentation Updates:**  
  Update this documentation alongside any code changes to ensure that all stakeholders and developers are aware of the current logic and intended behaviour.

- **Monitoring for Conflicts:**  
  Establish a periodic review process with other Tealium iQ extension maintainers to detect and resolve any potential conflicts, especially if multiple extensions modify global objects or the DOM structure.

- **Logging and Debugging:**  
  Consider implementing temporary logging (that can be removed in production) to debug the loading process during testing phases.

By following these guidelines and keeping this documentation updated, developers and stakeholders can ensure that the Celebrus Load Trigger extension functions reliably and remains maintainable over time.
