# Activity Map Extension Documentation

This document provides an overview, detailed code explanation, usage examples, known limitations, recommendations for refactoring, and maintenance notes for the Activity Map extension.

---

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Activity Map  
- **ID:** 1910 (Extension instance ID)  
- **Extension Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** 928  
- **Execution Frequency:** The code runs at the occurrence defined by the Tealium tag – typically on each page load or applicable event as defined by the Tealium configuration.

**Summary:**  
The Activity Map extension is designed to monitor and tag specific anchor elements on a page by setting a regional attribute (`lpos`) on their parent elements. This mapping helps track user interactions with ‘apply’ links on a webpage. In addition, the extension defines a list of keywords (exclusions) to filter out unwanted or sensitive data from being included in tracking.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables and Definitions

- **Parameters:**  
  The self-executing function uses three parameters (`a`, `b`, and `u`), where `u` is expected to expose global objects related to tag configuration.

- **activityMap:**  
  Defined as `u.o.ActivityMap`, this object is used to store configuration properties such as the region attribute identifier and any link exclusions.

- **activityMap.regionIDAttribute:**  
  Set to `"lpos"`, this property defines the HTML attribute key that will be added to parent elements of target links.

- **applyLinkSelectors:**  
  An array containing two CSS attribute selectors:  
  - `"a[href*=apply\\.]"`  
  - `"a[href*=apply2\\.]"`  
  These selectors target anchor tags whose `href` attribute contains the substrings “apply.” or “apply2.” respectively.

### Logic Flow

1. **Link Selection and Parent Tag Assignment:**
   - The code combines the selectors into a single string using the `join()` method.
   - Using `document.querySelectorAll()`, it selects all anchor elements matching these criteria.
   - It then transforms the NodeList into an array (via `Array.from`) and iterates using `forEach`.
   - For each matching element:
     - The index (`i`) is used along with the cleaned-up text content of the anchor (`e.textContent`) to generate an identifier in the format: `[index]. [link text]`.
     - This string is assigned to the parent element of the anchor as the value of the attribute identified by `lpos` (i.e. `activityMap.regionIDAttribute`).
   - The try-catch blocks ensure that errors (such as missing parent elements) are silently ignored.

2. **Exclusions Setting:**
   - A list of strings (keywords relating to various codes and sensitive information) is defined.
   - These strings are concatenated into a single comma-separated string and assigned to `activityMap.linkExclusions`.
   - If the global object `window.LBGAnalytics.activityMapExclusions` exists, its entries (after being joined by commas) are appended to the existing exclusions list. This allows for custom exclusions outside of the hard-coded list.

### Dependencies on Global Objects

- **u.o.ActivityMap:**  
  The extension depends on a global object that should be available under `u.o.ActivityMap` to store configuration (region ID attribute and exclusions).

- **window.LBGAnalytics.activityMapExclusions:**  
  If present, this global variable is used to add more values to the exclusions list. It provides additional flexibility if further exclusions are needed outside of the hard-coded set.

---

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Operation

- **Page with Apply Links:**  
  A page contains multiple anchor tags such as `<a href="https://example.apply.com">Apply Now</a>`.  
  - The extension locates these links via the defined selectors.
  - It cleans up the link text (removing extra white spaces) and assigns a value like “0. Apply Now” to the parent element’s `lpos` attribute.
  - This supports subsequent tracking and analysis by mapping user click activity on these elements.

- **Addition of Custom Exclusions:**  
  If an external script defines `window.LBGAnalytics.activityMapExclusions` (e.g. an array `["Custom Exclusion 1", "Custom Exclusion 2"]`), these values are appended to the exclusion list. This prevents these items from being processed by the activity map logic.

### Edge Conditions

- **Missing Parent Element:**  
  When an anchor element does not have a parent element, the inner try-catch will capture the exception, and no attribute will be assigned to that element.  
  - No error is thrown, and the extension simply moves on to the next element.

- **Empty or Malformed Link Text:**  
  If link text is empty or only consists of white spaces, the cleaning process ensures that the final attribute value might be “0. ”.  
  - While this may affect readability, the code does not perform further validation.

- **Non-matching Selectors:**  
  If there are no links matching the selectors on the page, the `querySelectorAll` call returns an empty NodeList and the extension completes without further processing—without errors.

---

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Silent Failure:**  
  The use of try-catch blocks (with empty catch bodies) means that when an error occurs (e.g. missing parent element), no warning or error log is produced.  
  - This may make debugging more challenging if issues arise.

- **Array.from ES6 Dependency:**  
  The current implementation uses `Array.from()`, which is not an ES5 method.  
  - Although the code is required to support ES5, you might need to provide a polyfill or refactor this call (using methods like `Array.prototype.slice.call`) if older browsers are used.

- **Global Dependency Conflicts:**  
  The extension modifies properties on the global `activityMap` object and uses `window.LBGAnalytics`.  
  - Conflicts might occur if other extensions or scripts modify these objects in unexpected ways.

- **Hard-Coded Exclusion List:**  
  The large list of exclusions is hard-coded.  
  - Future changes to exclusion criteria require edits in the source code rather than using dynamic configuration.

---

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **ES5 Compatibility Adjustment:**  
  - Replace `Array.from(document.querySelectorAll(...))` with an alternative like  
    `[].slice.call(document.querySelectorAll(...))` to ensure ES5 compatibility.
  
- **Improve Error Handling:**  
  - Rather than an empty catch block, consider logging errors (where appropriate) to help with debugging, or at least documenting potential exceptions.

- **Code Modularity:**  
  - Break down the large function into smaller helper functions (for example, a function to process each link and another to build the exclusions string).  
  - This improves readability and ease of maintenance.

- **Documentation In-line:**  
  - Add inline comments explaining key logic sections, the purpose of each try-catch block, and the role of the exclusion list.

- **Configuration Flexibility:**  
  - Consider externalising the exclusion list or other configuration parameters. This would allow modifications without changing the extension code directly.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  - Ensure that dependencies (such as `u.o.ActivityMap` and `window.LBGAnalytics`) remain in sync with other parts of your Tealium configuration.
  - Periodically review the hard-coded exclusion list to verify that it remains relevant to current tracking requirements and data privacy considerations.

- **Ownership:**  
  - Assign a team or developer responsible for the maintenance of this extension. Include version control logs and update documentation whenever changes are made.

- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Validate the extension on pages with differing DOM structures to ensure that selectors work as intended.
  - Test cases should include pages that include and do not include the custom `window.LBGAnalytics.activityMapExclusions` array.
  - Include unit tests that simulate edge conditions, such as missing parent nodes or anchors with no text.
  - As changes are introduced, cross-browser testing (especially for ES5 compatibility) is essential.

- **Further Enhancements:**  
  - Monitor user feedback and analytic discrepancies which might suggest refining how links are tagged or exclusions are managed.
  - Keep track of runtime errors (if logged externally) to identify if additional defensive coding is necessary.

By following the above documentation, developers and stakeholders should gain a clear and thorough understanding of the Activity Map extension’s purpose, inner workings, and maintenance requirements. This documentation can also serve as a reference when adapting or expanding the extension in the future.
