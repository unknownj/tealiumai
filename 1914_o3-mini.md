# Temp Sortcode Fix for Investments

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the "Temp Sortcode fix for Investments" Tealium iQ extension. It details the extension’s purpose, code logic, usage examples, known limitations, recommendations for refactoring, and maintenance guidelines.

---

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Temp Sortcode fix for Investments  
- **ID:**  
  - Extension ID: 100040  
  - Instance ID: 1914  
- **Type:** Advanced Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** After Load Rules  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Always

**Summary:**  
This extension is designed to check whether an event’s journey name and QA question match a set of predefined values. If both the journey and the QA question match their respective lists (after converting them to lowercase), the extension sets the QA answer to a redacted value ("(Redacted)"). This is especially useful for masking or anonymising sensitive data during certain user journeys, specifically those related to investments.

---

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables

- **var1Values:** An array of strings that represent valid journey names.  
  Example values include:  
  - "applyinvestment"  
  - "applyrmpension"

- **var2Values:** An array of strings that represent valid QA questions (form fields or steps).  
  Example values include:
  - "edit ni number"
  - "enter email address"
  - "confirm email address"
  - "sortcode"
  - "name of account holder"
  - "account number"
  - "postcode"
  - "first line of address"
  - "second line of address"
  - "city or town"

### Logic Flow

1. **Input Parameters:**  
   The extension is invoked as an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE), receiving two parameters:
   - `a` (corresponds to `eventType`)
   - `b` (corresponds to `eventPayload`)

2. **Data Normalisation & Comparison:**  
   - The function retrieves the property `JourneyName` from the `eventPayload` and converts it to lowercase using `.toLowerCase()`.  
   - It then checks if this lowercased value is present in the `var1Values` array.  
   - Similarly, it retrieves `QAQuestion` from `eventPayload`, converts it to lowercase, and checks its presence in the `var2Values` array.

3. **Conditional Action:**  
   - If both checks pass (i.e. both values exist in the respective arrays), then the `QAAnswer` property of the `eventPayload` is set to "(Redacted)".  
   - If either condition does not pass, no modification occurs.

### Global Dependencies

- The function assumes that `eventType` (a string) and `eventPayload` (an object) are available in the global execution context.
- There are no external libraries or additional global objects required by this extension.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Example 1: Standard Scenario

**Input:**  
- eventPayload.JourneyName = "ApplyInvestment"  
- eventPayload.QAQuestion = "Sortcode"  

**Process:**  
- "ApplyInvestment" is converted to "applyinvestment" and is found in the `var1Values` array.
- "Sortcode" is converted to "sortcode" and is found in the `var2Values` array.

**Outcome:**  
- eventPayload.QAAnswer is set to "(Redacted)".

### Example 2: Non-matching Journey Name

**Input:**  
- eventPayload.JourneyName = "SomeOtherJourney"  
- eventPayload.QAQuestion = "Sortcode"  

**Process:**  
- "SomeOtherJourney" becomes "someotherjourney" which is not in the `var1Values` list.
- The second condition is not checked further once the first condition fails.

**Outcome:**  
- eventPayload.QAAnswer remains unchanged.

### Example 3: Non-matching QA Question

**Input:**  
- eventPayload.JourneyName = "ApplyRMPension"  
- eventPayload.QAQuestion = "some unrelated question"  

**Process:**  
- "ApplyRMPension" correctly converts to "applyrmpension" and is found in the `var1Values` list.
- "some unrelated question" will not be found in the `var2Values` list.

**Outcome:**  
- eventPayload.QAAnswer remains unchanged.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Case Sensitivity Handling:**  
  Although the comparison is made case-insensitive by converting values to lowercase, any discrepancy in how event values are named or populated may mislead the matching logic if unexpected formats are present.

- **Data Integrity:**  
  This extension operates under the assumption that the `JourneyName` and `QAQuestion` properties exist in the `eventPayload`. If for some reason these properties are not provided or are misnamed, the intended redaction will not occur.

- **Potential Conflicts:**  
  - If other Tealium iQ extensions modify the same properties (`QAAnswer` or other related keys) and are executed after this extension, there may be overwrites or unexpected behaviours.
  - Similarly, if external scripts modify these payload objects concurrently, debugging and ensuring data integrity may become challenging.

- **Hardcoded Values:**  
  The arrays `var1Values` and `var2Values` are hardcoded, meaning any updates to these lists require a code change in the extension. Consider centralising these values if they are subject to change.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

While maintaining ES5 compatibility, consider the following improvements:

- **Defensive Coding:**  
  Although the availability of `eventType` and `eventPayload` is guaranteed, you may consider checking for the existence of `JourneyName` and `QAQuestion` to avoid runtime errors if the payload structure changes:
  - For example, verifying that `typeof b["JourneyName"] === "string"` before applying `.toLowerCase()`.

- **Modularisation:**  
  If similar patterns are repeated in other extensions, refactor the matching logic into a helper function:
  - Create a common module for normalising strings and checking array membership.
  
- **Code Comments & Documentation:**  
  Increase in-line commenting for clarity, particularly explaining the purpose of each conditional check. This assists future developers in understanding the rationale behind each check.

- **Configurable Parameters:**  
  If supported by your deployment flow, consider moving the hardcoded arrays to a configuration file or data layer, so that updates do not require direct code changes.

- **ES5 Syntax Adjustments:**  
  Replace ES6 constructs with ES5 equivalents (e.g. using `var` instead of `const` and traditional function declarations) if your execution environment strictly enforces ES5.

*Refactored Code Example using ES5 Syntax:*

---------------------
/*  
(function(a, b) {
  // Array of values for var1 (journey names)
  var var1Values = ["applyinvestment", "applyrmpension"];
  
  // Array of values for var2 (QA questions)
  var var2Values = [
    "edit ni number",
    "enter email address",
    "confirm email address",
    "sortcode",
    "name of account holder",
    "account number",
    "postcode",
    "first line of address",
    "second line of address",
    "city or town"
  ];
  
  // Check if 'JourneyName' and 'QAQuestion' exist and are strings
  if (b["JourneyName"] && typeof b["JourneyName"] === "string" &&
      b["QAQuestion"] && typeof b["QAQuestion"] === "string") {
      
    var journey = b["JourneyName"].toLowerCase();
    var question = b["QAQuestion"].toLowerCase();
    
    if (var1Values.indexOf(journey) !== -1 && var2Values.indexOf(question) !== -1) {
      b["QAAnswer"] = "(Redacted)";
    }
  }
})(eventType, eventPayload);
*/

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ownership & Versioning:**  
  Maintain clear versioning of the extension and designate an owner who is responsible for updates and bug fixes. Incorporate change logs to track modifications.

- **Testing & Validation:**  
  - Set up automated tests (unit tests) that validate the functionality under normal, exceptional, and edge-case conditions.
  - Test this extension across various browsers and devices to ensure compatibility given the ES5 constraints.

- **Documentation Updates:**  
  Ensure that any changes to the hardcoded arrays or the overall logic are reflected in both the code comments and this documentation page.

- **Future Enhancements:**  
  As requirements evolve, consider extracting the hardcoded lists into a separate configuration module that can be updated without changing the core code logic.
