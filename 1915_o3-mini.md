# Signly Load Rule Extension Documentation

This document provides a detailed overview and explanation of the Signly Load Rule Tealium iQ extension. It covers the extension’s purpose, code specifics, example scenarios, limitations, and recommendations for improvements.

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Signly Load Rule  
- **ID:** 1915  
- **Extension Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** Before Load Rules  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Always  

**Summary:**  
The Signly Load Rule extension is designed to determine whether the ‘Signly’ feature should be enabled. It checks several conditions (payload flags, cookies, DOM elements, URL characteristics, and local storage) and computes a flag (set to either "Y" for yes or "N" for no) accordingly. This extension is typically used to control the display or activation of Signly-related components, such as form inputs or feature toggles, likely on pages associated with careers or job searches.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables & Constants

- **SIGNLY_KEY:**  
  Defined as `"showSignly"`. This key is used to construct other keys and references (e.g. cookie name, local storage key).

- **SIGNLY_SELECTOR:**  
  Set to `"input[name=signly]"`. This CSS selector is used to locate the Signly input element on the page.

### Logical Flow & Data Processing

1. **Initial Setup:**  
   The extension is wrapped in an immediately-invoked function expression (IIFE) that takes two parameters (`a` and `b`). These correspond to `eventType` and `eventPayload`, respectively. The code relies on `eventPayload` (referred as `b`) to read necessary parameters.

2. **Array of Conditions:**  
   An array is defined that evaluates several independent conditions:
   
   - **Payload Flag Check:**  
     Checks if `b.EnableSignly` has the value `"Y"`.  
     
   - **Cookie Flag Check:**  
     Evaluates if the cookie value present in `b` under the key constructed as `"cp." + SIGNLY_KEY` equals `"true"`.
     
   - **DOM Element Presence:**  
     Uses `document.querySelector(SIGNLY_SELECTOR)` to determine if an HTML input element with the name attribute set to `"signly"` exists on the page.  
     
   - **URL Check for GCA Careers:**  
     Verifies that the current hostname equals `"www.lloydsbankinggroup.com"` and that the pathname starts with `"/careers/job-search"`. This condition targets specific pages.
     
   - **Local Storage Check:**  
     Executes an immediate function that attempts to retrieve an item from `localStorage` under the key `SIGNLY_KEY` and checks if its value is `"true"`. A try-catch block is used to safeguard against access issues (for example, when localStorage is restricted).

3. **Decision Making:**  
   The array of conditions is reduced using a logical OR operation. If any one of the conditions returns `true`, the result of the reduction is truthy and `b.EnableSignly` is set to `"Y"`. Otherwise, it is set to `"N"`.

### Dependencies on Global Objects

- **document:** Used to query the DOM for the Signly input element.
- **window.location:** Utilised to inspect the current URL and hostname.
- **window.localStorage:** Accessed to check stored values that determine the Signly state.  
- **Tealium Data Layer:** The `eventPayload` (`b`) is a Tealium object containing data such as cookie flags and payload properties.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Example 1: Normal Operation on a Careers Page

- **Scenario:**  
  A user visits the careers job search page (`www.lloydsbankinggroup.com/careers/job-search`).  
- **Flow:**  
  - `eventPayload.EnableSignly` is not already set to `"Y"`.
  - No cookie exists with `"cp.showSignly"` set to `"true"`.
  - The DOM contains an input element with `name="signly"`.
  - The URL meets the criteria of the careers page.
  - Local storage returns `"false"` or is not set.
- **Outcome:**  
  At least one condition (the presence of the element and matching URL) is true. Hence, the reduction returns true and the extension sets `b.EnableSignly` to `"Y"`.

### Example 2: Feature Disabled via All Conditions False

- **Scenario:**  
  A user visits a page unrelated to careers, the DOM lacks the `input[name=signly]` element, and neither cookies nor local storage is set.
- **Flow:**  
  - `eventPayload.EnableSignly` is not `"Y"`.
  - `b["cp.showSignly"]` is not `"true"`.
  - `document.querySelector("input[name=signly]")` returns null.
  - The URL does not match the careers pattern.
  - Local storage check returns false.
- **Outcome:**  
  No condition is met. The reduce operation returns false, therefore, `b.EnableSignly` is set to `"N"`.

### Example 3: Local Storage Overrides Other Conditions

- **Scenario:**  
  A user’s local storage has the key `"showSignly"` set to `"true"`, even though the current page may not display the Signly input element.
- **Flow:**  
  - The local storage check is executed inside the IIFE and returns true.
- **Outcome:**  
  The condition is satisfied, setting `b.EnableSignly` to `"Y"` regardless of the other conditions.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **DOM Dependency:**  
  The use of `document.querySelector` means that if the Signly element is added dynamically after the extension runs, it may not trigger the condition. Special handling (e.g. re-running the check) might be needed in dynamic environments.

- **URL Matching:**  
  The extension hard-codes URL conditions targeting a specific hostname and path. If the website’s structure changes or if there are multiple domains, the extension may not behave as intended.

- **localStorage Access:**  
  Although a try-catch block is in place for local storage access, any restrictions or errors in localStorage access (e.g. when running in privacy modes) will effectively disable that condition without notifying the user.

- **Data Type Assumptions:**  
  The code assumes that payload flags and cookie values are correctly set as strings ("Y", "true"). Any deviation (e.g. boolean true) may cause unexpected behaviour since strict string comparison is used.

- **Order of Execution:**  
  Since the extension runs before load rules, any changes to payload or globals that occur afterward will not influence its decision. This can lead to missed updates if other extensions modify the same keys asynchronously.

- **Potential Global Conflicts:**  
  If other Tealium extensions or external scripts modify `b.EnableSignly` or use the same key (`showSignly`) in `localStorage` or cookies, conflicts might arise.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Enhance Modularity:**  
  Consider refactoring the code into separate functions for each condition (e.g. checkPayloadFlag, checkCookie, checkDOMElement, etc.) to improve readability and ease future maintenance.

- **Improved Logging:**  
  Introduce logging (where feasible within ES5 constraints) to debug which condition is met. This may assist in troubleshooting ambiguous cases especially during dynamic content loads.

- **Consolidate Conditions:**  
  Evaluate if certain conditions can be merged or evaluated in a more efficient order. For instance, checking the URL before querying the DOM element might prevent unnecessary DOM queries if the page context is already inappropriate.

- **Error Handling Strategy:**  
  While localStorage already has a try-catch block, consider whether similar protections should apply to other operations that might fail due to unexpected data types or missing objects.

- **Documentation Within Code:**  
  Add inline comments explaining each condition check within the code, especially for future developers who may not be familiar with the specific business logic or why certain conditions are enforced.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  - Establish a versioning system and changelog for the extension to track updates and modifications.  
  - Regularly review the URL checks and DOM structure to ensure compliance with the current website design and requirements.
  
- **Ownership & Responsibility:**  
  - Assign a maintainer for the extension who understands both the technical and business logic behind the Signly feature.
  
- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Develop test cases covering all condition branches, including payload, cookie, DOM, URL, and localStorage scenarios.
  - Ensure testing across multiple browsers to verify that local storage and DOM queries behave consistently.
  - Set up automated tests or manual test protocols whenever there are updates to any dependant global objects or website structure.
  
- **Future Enhancements:**  
  Consider creating detailed monitoring and error reporting mechanisms to alert relevant teams if the extension is not performing as expected in production environments.
