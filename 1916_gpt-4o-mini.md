# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: Signly Tag Code

## 1. Extension Overview
- **Name**: Signly Tag Code
- **ID**: 1916
- **Type**: Javascript Code
- **Scope**: 1643
- **Execution Frequency**: Once per page load

### Summary
This extension is responsible for integrating the Signly assistive technology into the website of Lloyds Banking Group. It loads the relevant JavaScript and CSS files required for Signly to function. The extension also tracks user interactions with the Signly interface, sending relevant analytics events to LBGAnalytics. The goal is to enhance accessibility by providing translation services for users.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- **SIGNLY_ENDPOINT**: Base URL for loading Signly resources.
- **SIGNLY_STYLESHEET**: Name of the stylesheet for Signly.
- **SIGNLY_SCRIPT**: Name of the JavaScript file for Signly.
  
### Logic Flow
1. **Initialization Check**: The script checks if the `u.initialised` variable is false to prevent multiple initialisations.
2. **Loading Resources**: Stylesheet and script are appended to the document head and body respectively.
3. **Event Listener for Interactions**: A click event listener tracks user actions with the Signly interface and sends corresponding events to LBGAnalytics.
4. **Fix Signly Logo**: The script attempts to set a specific class on the Signly logo periodically (every 500ms) to ensure consistent styling.
5. **Error Handling**: Wrapped in try-catch blocks to prevent errors from stopping the script.

### Dependencies
- **LBGAnalytics**: The script interacts with the LBGAnalytics object for analytics tracking. 
- **Global Objects**: Utilises standard DOM methods and properties(`document`, `window`, etc.), and relies on the presence of the Signly markup on the page.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Conditions
- When the page loads, the Signly styles and scripts will be correctly appended to the document. After 1 second, an 'Assistive Technology' event is dispatched indicating that Signly has loaded.

### Edge Conditions
- If the `#signly-button.translated` is clicked, an event is sent to track the translation request with the current URL.
- If `div.signly-video-button` is clicked, it captures and logs the class of the button being pressed.
- Errors in locating the specified elements are silently caught and do not disrupt the flow of the extension.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Resource Loading Timing**: If the Signly resources fail to load within a short time frame, certain functionalities may not work as expected.
- **Manual CSS Class Assignment**: The logo fix runs every 500ms, which may lead to unnecessary performance overhead if many instances of the logo are present.
- **Conflict with Other Scripts**: Other scripts that might manipulate the DOM or the same elements can create conflicts or suppress the proper triggers for events.
- **Error Handling**: The current error handling is minimal, which might obfuscate underlying issues that should be addressed explicitly.

---

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Modularization**: Consider splitting the functionality into separate functions (e.g., for loading resources, handling events, fixing logos) to improve code readability and maintainability.
- **Defensive Checks**: Include checks to ensure elements exist before attempting to bind events to them to prevent errors, although focus should remain on supporting ES5.
- **Inline Comments**: Add comments explaining complex logic for future developers and maintainers. This increases the understandability of the code with minimal effort.
- **Performance Considerations**: Rather than running the logo fix in a set interval, consider invoking it after the relevant elements have been rendered in the DOM.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ownership**: Assign a dedicated owner for the maintenance of this extension, and ensure they are familiar with the Signly integration and the LBGAnalytics framework.
- **Testing Guidelines**: Establish a robust testing process to ensure that all analytics events trigger correctly, especially after updates or changes to related code.
- **Monitoring Changes**: Regularly review the Signly API and any updates to ensure compatibility with upcoming changes in their service.
- **Documentation Updates**: Regularly update this documentation to reflect any changes made to the codebase or usage scenarios.
