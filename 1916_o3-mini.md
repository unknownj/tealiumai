# Signly Tag Code Extension Documentation

This document describes the “Signly Tag Code” extension used in Tealium iQ. It covers an overview of the extension, a detailed code explanation, usage examples, known limitations, refactoring recommendations, and further maintenance notes.

---

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Signly Tag Code  
- **Extension ID:** 1916 (Internal) / 100036 (Tealium extension identifier)  
- **Type:** JavaScript Code  
- **Scope:** 1643  
- **Execution Frequency:**  
  - The extension runs on page load.  
  - It is designed to initialise only once per page (guarded by an “initialised” flag in the tag object).  
  - It sets up event listeners for click events and periodic checks via a timer.

**Summary:**  
This extension inserts external CSS and JavaScript files from the Signly endpoint into the page, ensuring that the Signly assistive technology is available. It sends various analytics events capturing both the initial load and user interactions (such as requests for translation and video button clicks). Additionally, the extension sets up a fix for the Signly logo styling by periodically checking and updating the element’s CSS class if necessary. Special toggle functions are provided for the host "www.lloydsbankinggroup.com" in a minimised configuration that lacks a signly cookie.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Function Wrapper & Initialisation
- Uses an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) with three parameters:  
  - `a` (eventType),  
  - `b` (eventPayload), and  
  - `u` (tagObject).  
- The function first checks if `u.initialised` is true and returns early if so, ensuring the code only runs once.

### Key Variables
- **SIGNLY_ENDPOINT:**  
  - URL endpoint ("https://cdn.signly.co/release/latest/") from which the CSS and JS files are retrieved.
  
- **SIGNLY_STYLESHEET & SIGNLY_SCRIPT:**  
  - The names of the stylesheet (`signly-british.css`) and script (`signly-british.umd.min.js`) files that are appended to the document.

### Global Hostname Check
- When the location hostname is `"www.lloydsbankinggroup.com"`, the extension sets dummy functions (`window.turnOnSignly` and `window.turnOffSignly`) that log a message.  
  - This is a workaround for the minimised version where no cookie is set.

### Adding External Resources
- The extension uses the global object `LBGAnalytics.el4` to create HTML elements:  
  - A `<link>` element for the stylesheet is appended to `document.head`.
  - A `<script>` element for the JavaScript is appended to `document.body`.

### Analytics Event for Signly Initial Load
- A `setTimeout` is used to send an analytics event ("Signly Loaded") after 1000 milliseconds via `LBGAnalytics.events.send`.
  - The event properties include `JourneyEvent`, `EventAction`, and `EventNarrative`.

### Click Event Listener
- A document-wide click event listener is added with a try/catch block for error handling.
- It listens for clicks on specific elements by using the `closest()` method:
  - **#signly-button.translated:**  
    - Sends a "Request Translation" event that includes the current hostname and path.
    
  - **div.signly-video-button:**  
    - Sends a "Translate Content" event, concatenating the class attribute of the clicked element.
    
  - **div.signly-header-actions:**  
    - Sends a "Translate Content" event which retrieves the `aria-label` of the closest parent button element.
- Errors within the click event handling (e.g. element not found) are caught and silently ignored.

### Fix for the Signly Logo
- A local function `fixSignlyLogo` is defined to:
  - Find an element with the ID `"signly-logo"`.
  - Check if the element already has a `class` attribute.
  - If not, it sets the `class` attribute to `"c-103-rich-text"` and logs the update.
- This function runs every 500 milliseconds via `setInterval` to ensure that any dynamically added logo is styled appropriately.

### Dependencies
- **Global LBGAnalytics Object:**  
  - Used for creating and appending HTML elements (`LBGAnalytics.el4.make`).
  - For sending analytics events (`LBGAnalytics.events.send`).
  - For logging purposes (`LBGAnalytics.analyticsLog`).
- **DOM Methods:**  
  - Uses standard DOM methods like `document.getElementById`, `document.addEventListener`, `closest()`, and element attribute methods.
- **Native Methods:**  
  - `setTimeout` and `setInterval` for scheduling functions.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Flow
1. **Page Load:**  
   - When a page loads, the extension checks if it is already initialised.  
   - It then appends the external CSS and JavaScript files from the SIGNLY_ENDPOINT into the document.
  
2. **Analytics Event After Load:**  
   - One second after initialisation, an analytics event "Signly Loaded" is sent reporting that the Signly functionality is available.
  
3. **User Interaction:**  
   - If a user clicks on an element that matches `#signly-button.translated`, an event ("Request Translation") is sent that includes the current URL (hostname and pathname).
   - If a click occurs on `div.signly-video-button` or elements within `div.signly-header-actions`, appropriate translation-related analytics events are sent with details of the interaction.

### Edge Conditions
- **Non-matching Clicks:**  
  - If a user clicks outside the defined elements, no analytics events are triggered.
  
- **Missing Elements:**  
  - If the `signly-logo` element does not exist, the `fixSignlyLogo` function safely exits without error.
  
- **Minimal Environment on Specific Host:**  
  - On the "www.lloydsbankinggroup.com" hostname, rather than loading Signly functionality fully, the extension sets up dummy toggle functions which simply log a console message.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **External Dependency Assumptions:**  
  - The extension assumes that the `LBGAnalytics` global object is available and fully functional.
  - There is no error handling if the external Signly CSS or JavaScript files fail to load.
  
- **Browser Compatibility:**  
  - The code uses the `closest()` method. While this is standard in most modern browsers, it may require a polyfill for legacy browsers (e.g. Internet Explorer).
  
- **setInterval Usage:**  
  - The recurring call to `fixSignlyLogo` via `setInterval` does not have an exit condition. If the Signly logo is permanently missing, the function continues to execute every 500 milliseconds.
  
- **Potential Conflicts:**  
  - The use of global functions for toggling Signly (e.g. `window.turnOnSignly` and `window.turnOffSignly`) might conflict with other scripts that define or rely on the same names.
  - Relying on specific DOM structures (e.g. expecting a button as a parent of `div.signly-header-actions`) could cause unexpected behaviour if the DOM structure changes.

---

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Modularisation:**  
  - Break the code into smaller helper functions (e.g. one for appending external resources, one for sending analytics events, and one for handling click events).
  
- **Defensive Checks for Global Dependencies:**  
  - Although eventType and eventPayload are guaranteed, consider verifying that `LBGAnalytics` and its properties (`el4`, `events`, `analyticsLog`) exist before invoking them.
  
- **Improved Interval Management:**  
  - Consider a mechanism to clear the `setInterval` once the Signly logo has been fixed, to prevent unnecessary function calls.
  
- **Error Handling:**  
  - While the try/catch blocks prevent errors from bubbling up, adding logging for caught exceptions (in a development environment) could help with diagnostics.
  
- **Documentation of External Requirements:**  
  - Note in inline documentation that the browser environment must support `closest()` or include a polyfill for safe execution in older browsers.
  
- **Naming Consistency:**  
  - Ensure that function and variable names are consistent and descriptive to aid long-term maintainability.

*Note: Do not worry about defensive coding with respect to the availability of eventType or eventPayload as they are guaranteed to be present.*

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Testing:**  
  - Regularly test the extension across all supported browsers and devices, especially if the external Signly API endpoints change.
  - Validate that the analytics events are sent as expected on both normal and edge cases.
  
- **Ownership:**  
  - Identify a specific team or individual (e.g. the LBGAnalytics team) responsible for updates, testing, and troubleshooting of this extension.
  
- **Monitoring Dependencies:**  
  - Keep track of any changes to the external resources (CSS/JS files) hosted on the Signly endpoint, as these may necessitate adjustments in the extension.
  
- **Version Control & Change Log:**  
  - Maintain version control and include a changelog to capture modifications along with reasons for changes, detailing any refactoring or feature adjustments.
  
- **Documentation Updates:**  
  - Ensure that this documentation is updated if the extension’s functionality changes and that it is easily accessible to other developers and stakeholders.
