# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: Legacy Clicks

## 1. Extension Overview
- **Name**: Legacy Clicks
- **ID**: 100036
- **Type**: JavaScript Code
- **Scope**: DOM Ready
- **Execution Frequency**: Run Once

### Summary
The "Legacy Clicks" extension monitors interactions within a web page for events associated with "WebTrends". When an event occurs that includes a specific attribute (`WT.ac`), the extension triggers an analytical event (`Legacy Santiago Click`) that sends the value of `WT.ac` to the analytics service (`LBGAnalytics`). This functionality is essential for preserving legacy tracking in systems where "WebTrends" is still a component of analytics.

## 2. Code Explanation
### Key Variables
- `LBG.track`: A global object adapted to send analytics events.
- `payload`: The object representing the data to be processed by the `LBG.track` function.

### Logic Flow
1. The code first checks if `LBG.track` contains the string "WebTrends". If it does, it overrides the `LBG.track` function.
2. Within the new function, it checks if the `payload` object contains an attribute `WT.ac`.
3. If `WT.ac` is present, it sends an event (`Legacy Santiago Click`) with the value of `WT.ac` to `LBGAnalytics`.
4. Error handling is implemented using try-catch blocks, but any errors are ignored silently.

### Dependencies
- **Global Object**: `LBG` is assumed to be a pre-defined global object that is not defined within this snippet.
- **Library**: Utilises `LBGAnalytics`, which is presumed to be included in the broader application that the extension is a part of.

## 3. Usage Examples
### Normal Condition
- When a user interacts with an element that triggers a WebTrends event and includes the attribute `WT.ac`:
    ```javascript
    LBG.track({ "WT.ac": "Homepage Link Click" });
    ```
  This interaction will result in:
    ```javascript
    LBGAnalytics.events.send({
        JourneyEvent: "Legacy Santiago Click",
        LinkValue: "Homepage Link Click"
    });
    ```

### Edge Conditions
- If the `payload` does not include `WT.ac`:
  ```javascript
  LBG.track({ "WT.someOtherAttribute": "Some Value" });
  ```
  In this scenario, no events will be sent to `LBGAnalytics`, and the extension will simply do nothing.

- If `LBG.track` is not a function or becomes malformed:
  The outer try-catch block ensures that any errors do not break the overall tracking. However, tracking events will not function until the issue is resolved.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas
- **Silent Failures**: The extension utilizes silent error handling. This can make debugging difficult as no logs will indicate where failures occur.
- **Dependency on `LBG`**: If `LBG` is not defined prior to this extension being executed, it will have no effect, and any expected tracking will be lost.
- **Potential Conflicts**: Overriding `LBG.track` could potentially conflict with other scripts that also rely on this function unless properly managed.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring
- **Error Logging**: Implement logging within catch statements to aid in identifying and diagnosing issues. For example, using `console.error(e)` to capture error details.
- **Function Modularity**: Refactor the new `LBG.track` function into a separate handler function to improve readability and maintainability:
    ```javascript
    function handleLBGTrack(payload) {
        // processing logic
    }
    ```
- **Conditional Checks**: It could be beneficial to explicitly check if `payload` is an object before accessing properties to avoid potential runtime errors.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes
- **Testing Guidelines**: Regularly test the extension in various browsers and scenarios to ensure compatibility. Automated test scripts should be considered for continuous integration setups.
- **Ownership**: Designate a developer or a team responsible for the upkeep of this extension. Regular reviews should be scheduled to ensure it meets evolving analytics needs.
- **Documentation Updates**: Keep this documentation current whenever modifications to the extension are made, ensuring team members are aware of its purpose and functionality.
