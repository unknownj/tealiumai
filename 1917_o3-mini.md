# Legacy Clicks Extension Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Legacy Clicks extension for Tealium iQ, including its purpose, code logic, usage examples, known limitations, refactoring suggestions, and maintenance guidelines.

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Legacy Clicks  
- **ID:** 1917  
- **Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** DOM Ready  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Once  

**Summary:**  
The Legacy Clicks extension is designed to intercept legacy click tracking calls made through the global LBG.track function. When the function contains the substring "WebTrends", this extension overrides it with a custom implementation. The new implementation inspects the payload for the presence of a "WT.ac" property and, if available, sends a corresponding event ("Legacy Santiago Click") via the LBGAnalytics object. This extension ensures that legacy tracking events flow correctly to the updated analytics system without modifying the existing call sites.

---

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables and Global Objects

- **LBG.track:**  
  A global function that is used for click tracking. The extension checks if its string representation contains "WebTrends" to determine if it is part of a legacy implementation.

- **payload:**  
  The parameter passed into the overridden LBG.track function. It is expected to be an object that may contain various properties, including "WT.ac".

- **LBGAnalytics.events.send:**  
  A global method used to send analytics events. It is called with an event object that includes a JourneyEvent name and an associated LinkValue when a valid payload is detected.

### Logic Flow

1. **Initial Check & Override Condition:**  
   - The extension first converts the existing LBG.track function to a string using the `toString()` method and checks if it includes the substring "WebTrends".  
   - If the check passes, it indicates that the legacy version of LBG.track is in use, so the extension proceeds to override it with a custom function.

2. **Custom Function Implementation:**  
   - The new version of LBG.track accepts a `payload` object as its parameter.
   - Inside this function, it verifies if the payload contains a property `"WT.ac"`.
     - **If present:**  
       The function calls `LBGAnalytics.events.send()` with an object that has:
         - `JourneyEvent` set to `"Legacy Santiago Click"`.
         - `LinkValue` derived from `payload["WT.ac"]`.
     - **Error Handling:**  
       Both the override logic and the invocation of `LBGAnalytics.events.send()` are encapsulated in try-catch blocks to prevent runtime errors from affecting the overall operation.

### Dependencies

- **Global Variables/Functions:**  
  - `LBG.track`: The legacy click tracking function subject to override.
  - `LBGAnalytics.events.send`: The function used to forward the new analytics event.
- **Legacy Code:**  
  - The code depends on legacy WebTrends implementation details (as inferred from the string check).

## 3. Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Normal Execution

- **Input:**  
  A click event triggers a call to `LBG.track` with a payload that includes:
  ```js
  { "WT.ac": "button_click" }
  ```
- **Process:**  
  - The extension checks the `LBG.track` function and confirms it contains "WebTrends".  
  - The overridden function is executed.  
  - Since `payload["WT.ac"]` is present, `LBGAnalytics.events.send` is called with:
    ```js
    {
        JourneyEvent: "Legacy Santiago Click",
        LinkValue: "button_click"
    }
    ```
- **Result:**  
  The legacy click is successfully routed to the LBGAnalytics event tracking system.

### Scenario 2: Edge Condition â€“ Missing "WT.ac" Property

- **Input:**  
  A click event triggers a call to `LBG.track` with a payload that does not include the `"WT.ac"` property:
  ```js
  { "someOtherProperty": "value" }
  ```
- **Process:**  
  - The function detects that `"WT.ac"` is missing in the payload.  
  - No call to `LBGAnalytics.events.send` is made.
- **Result:**  
  The extension silently exits without sending an analytics event, thereby avoiding potentially erroneous tracking.

### Scenario 3: Error in Global Object (e.g., LBGAnalytics is undefined)

- **Input:**  
  A situation where, due to script loading issues, `LBGAnalytics` is not defined.
- **Process:**  
  - Any attempt to call `LBGAnalytics.events.send` will cause an exception.  
  - The try-catch block within the custom function catches this error.
- **Result:**  
  The error is silently handled, and the extension prevents further execution disruption.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Silent Failure:**  
  The extensive use of try-catch blocks may obscure underlying issues by failing silently. This approach can delay troubleshooting by not logging errors.

- **Dependency on Legacy Signature:**  
  The extension relies on the legacy signature of `LBG.track` (i.e. its string representation containing "WebTrends"). Any changes to this logic in the future could prevent the extension from overriding the function as intended.

- **Potential Conflicts:**  
  - Other Tealium iQ extensions that modify or override the same global functions (`LBG.track` or `LBGAnalytics.events.send`) may lead to conflicts.  
  - External scripts that interact with these global objects might not be aware of the override, resulting in unexpected behaviour.

- **No Validation of Payload Structure:**  
  The code only checks for the existence of `"WT.ac"` in the payload but does not validate its value or type.

---

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Enhanced Logging:**  
  - Consider adding logging (while remaining within ES5 constraints) to report when the override is executed or when errors occur, rather than failing silently.

- **Granular Error Handling:**  
  - Instead of wrapping the entire block in try-catch statements, handle known potential error sources individually to ease debugging.

- **Separation of Concerns:**  
  - Modularise the code by separating the condition check, payload validation, and event sending into discrete functions. This can help improve readability and maintainability.

- **Clear Documentation within Code:**  
  - Add inline comments that explain the rationale behind checking for "WebTrends" in `LBG.track`, which would assist future developers in understanding the legacy support mechanism.

*Note:*  
Defensive coding for verifying the presence of `eventType` (string) or `eventPayload` (object) has not been considered as these are guaranteed to be present by project standards.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  - Regularly review and test the extension to ensure it functions correctly within the context of any changes to the legacy code or the analytics library.
  - Monitor for potential conflicts with new extensions or updates to global functions (`LBG.track` and `LBGAnalytics.events.send`).

- **Ownership and Testing:**  
  - Assign a clear owner or team responsible for the monitoring and updating of this extension.
  - Implement test cases to cover both normal operation and edge conditions. Unit tests should simulate various payload states and global object availability to ensure robust error handling.

- **Documentation Updates:**  
  - Keep this document updated as changes are made to the extension, ensuring that collaborators and stakeholders are aware of the current state and any technical debt.

- **Backward Compatibility:**  
  - Given that the extension supports legacy functionality, ensure that any refactoring or improvements do not break compatibility with existing systems relying on the legacy behaviour.
