# Deep Linking – Link Decoration Extension Documentation

This document provides comprehensive details about the "Deep linking - link decoration" extension in Tealium iQ. It includes an overview, a detailed code explanation, usage examples, known limitations, refactoring recommendations, and guidance for future maintenance.

---

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Deep linking - link decoration  
- **ID:** 1918 (extension instance), Library ID: 100036  
- **Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** DOM Ready  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Once  

**Summary:**  
This extension decorates anchor (`<a>`) elements that meet specific criteria by appending or modifying query string parameters. It inspects the current page URL’s search string and extracts values for various UTM parameters (such as utm_source, utm_medium, utm_campaign, utm_term, utm_adgroup) as well as other tracking IDs (like msclkid, gclsrc, gclid, _fbc, fbclid, dclid, ttclid). If the URL meets one or more of the defined criteria (i.e. a particular pathname), then the extracted parameters are appended to the links on the page that match the selector. This is useful to pass tracking information for deep linking from landing pages to the target pages.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Global Object Dependency
- The code relies on the global object `LBGAnalytics.santa` and its method `do()`. The inclusion of this method is assumed to be provided by an external library or a prior Tealium script.

### Breakdown of Code Flow
1. **Initialisation via LBGAnalytics.santa.do**  
   The extension is invoked with a configuration object using the method `LBGAnalytics.santa.do()`. The primary action specified is `"lazy-container"`, which likely indicates that the processing should occur in a deferred manner after DOM Ready.
   
2. **Actions Array – Single "decorate" Action**  
   Inside the configuration object is an array of actions to be executed. In this case, there is one action object with the following key properties:
   - **action:** `"decorate"`  
     Indicates that the functionality is to modify or "decorate" link elements.
   
   - **selector:**  
     The CSS selector targets anchor tags (`<a>`) whose `href` attribute contains one of the following substrings:
     - `/loans-strategic/`
     - `/app.html`
     - `/car_finance_hub/`
     
     This means only the links that include these substrings in their href will be processed.
   
3. **Parameters Object – Extraction of Query String Values**  
   The `parameters` object defines multiple keys corresponding to standard UTM and tracking parameters. Each key (e.g. `utm_source`, `utm_medium`, etc.) specifies:
   - **source:** "data" – Indicating that the value is derived from the URL or data object.
   - **variable:** "search" – Suggests that the search string (the portion of the URL after the `?`) is utilised.
   - **operations:**  
     An array of string operations that sequentially manipulate the search string. These operations include:
     - `toLowerCase`: Converts the URL string to lower case.
     - Multiple occurrences of `split`, `splice`, and `join`:  
       The typical pattern is to first split by the `?`, use `splice` to select the query parameter portion, then further split around the specific parameter (e.g. `utm_source=`) and then isolate the value by further splitting on the ampersand (`&`). Finally, the parts are re-joined to form the final value.
     
     Note that operations for some parameters (like `msclkid`) do not convert to lower case because of differences in case sensitivity or expected value format.
   
4. **Set Flag and Pathname Criteria**  
   - **set:** true  
     This flag indicates that once the value is extracted and processed, it will be set on the matching link elements.
   - **criteria:**  
     An array of strings containing conditions on `pathname`. This acts as a further restriction so that only pages with certain defined URL paths are subject to link decoration. For example:
     - `pathname equals /loans/landing-pages/home-ppc-dl.html`
     - `pathname contains /mobile-banking-app/app-download`
     
     These conditions ensure that the query parameter extraction and decoration only occurs on specific landing pages or mobile app download pages.
     
### Key Variables and Logic Flow
- **Primary Selector Variable:**  
  Selector matching anchor elements with specific substrings set in the `href`.
  
- **Operations Array Mechanism:**  
  Each parameter’s extraction involves a series of string operations. The approach is to:
  - Lowercase the search string (if required).
  - Split to isolate the query string.
  - Use splice and join to extract the desired parameter value segment.
  
  The operations are performed sequentially until the desired value is obtained.
  
- **Criteria Checks:**  
  The code checks if the current page’s pathname matches any of the pre-defined values or contains a given substring before applying the decoration. This helps ensure that the operation is only executed on supported pages.

### Dependencies
- Global variable: `LBGAnalytics.santa`
- Assumed presence of methods: `do()` on the global object.
- The code relies on standard JavaScript string methods that are supported in ES5.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Example Scenario 1: Standard Behaviour
- **URL:**  
  https://www.example.com/loans/landing-pages/home-ppc-dl.html?utm_source=Google&utm_medium=CPC&utm_campaign=SummerSale&msclkid=abc123
- **Expected Flow:**
  1. The extension runs on DOM Ready because the page’s pathname matches `/loans/landing-pages/home-ppc-dl.html`.
  2. The search string is processed to extract:
     - utm_source: "google"
     - utm_medium: "cpc"
     - utm_campaign: "summersale"
     - msclkid: "abc123"
  3. All `<a>` tags matching the selector (e.g. with `/loans-strategic/` in the href) are decorated by appending these parameters to their URL.

### Example Scenario 2: Edge Conditions
- **URL:**  
  https://www.example.com/app.html?utm_term=&utm_adgroup=AdGroup1&fbclid=XYZ123
- **Expected Flow:**
  1. The page matches the criteria based on pathname (if one of the criteria includes `/app.html` pages).
  2. The extension extracts the provided parameters:
     - utm_term will be empty, as indicated by the empty parameter.
     - utm_adgroup: "adgroup1" (after converting to lower case).
     - fbclid: "xyz123" will be processed similarly.
  3. Only links with hrefs containing `/app.html` are decorated with the (possibly empty) values.
  
### Example Scenario 3: No Matching Links
- **URL:**  
  https://www.example.com/loans/landing-pages/home-ppc-dl.html?gclid=optIn456
- **Expected Flow:**
  1. Even though the page qualifies based on pathname, if no anchor element on the page has an href that matches the provided selectors (i.e., anchors do not contain `/loans-strategic/`, `/app.html`, or `/car_finance_hub/`), then no link decoration occurs.
  2. The operations still extract `gclid` but since there's no target element, it is never applied.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Reliance on URL Structure:**  
  The extraction and manipulation of query parameters depend heavily on the URL structure and the presence of the question mark (`?`) separator. Any variation may result in incorrect extraction.
  
- **Hard-Coded Selector & Criteria:**  
  The selectors and pathname criteria are hard-coded. Changes to website structure (e.g. new landing pages or updated URL paths) require manual update to the criteria.
  
- **Order of Operations:**  
  The series of string operations must be executed in the designated order. If the URL does not strictly conform to expectations (e.g. missing parameters, different order), the operations might extract unintended values or fail.
  
- **Potential Conflicts:**  
  - Other Tealium iQ extensions or external scripts manipulating anchor links may conflict with this decoration if they run concurrently.
  - If any other scripts override the global `LBGAnalytics.santa` object or its `do` method, the extension might fail or exhibit unexpected behaviour.

- **Limited Error Handling:**  
  The code does not include any conditional defensive checks for unexpected data shapes. It assumes that the search query will always be in a specific format.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Modularise Operation Sequences:**  
  Consider creating a helper function that takes the search string and a parameter name (e.g. "utm_source") and returns the extracted value. This could reduce repetition in specifying operations for each parameter, even within the confines of ES5.

- **Commenting and Documentation within Code:**  
  Add inline comments to document the order and purpose of each string operation to aid future developers in understanding or modifying the extraction process.

- **Simplify Repeated Logic:**  
  Where possible, factor out common operations. For instance, operations like `split('?')`, `splice(1)`, and `join` are repeated - these could be encapsulated within a utility for clarity and reuse.

- **Improve Selector Flexibility:**  
  If the selectors or criteria are expected to evolve, consider externalising these values into a configuration object that can be updated without modifying the core logic.

- **Testing Edge Cases:**  
  Ensure that unit tests include URLs with different permutations (e.g. missing parameters, empty strings, extra parameters) to validate that the string manipulation logic works as expected.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  - Regularly review the URL patterns and criteria to ensure they remain in sync with the website’s structure and marketing campaigns.
  - Maintain a version log and update the documentation when any changes are made to selectors, operations, or criteria.
  
- **Ownership:**  
  Assign a primary developer or a team responsible for tracking the performance and issues related to the deep linking functionality.
  
- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Create a suite of automated tests using dummy URLs to simulate various scenarios.  
  - Test in both staging and production environments to ensure the extension behaves correctly after any changes to the underlying analytics or marketing strategies.
  - Validate against potential conflicts by auditing all active Tealium extensions that might also manipulate links or modify query parameters.

- **Documentation Updates:**  
  Keep this documentation in a central repository (e.g. within your project’s GitHub documentation) and update it as changes occur. Include versioning information for better traceability.
