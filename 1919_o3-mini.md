# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: GTM 4 GCA

This document provides a comprehensive guide for the GTM 4 GCA extension deployed via Tealium iQ. It covers an overview, code explanation, usage examples, limitations, recommendations for refactoring, and maintenance notes.

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** GTM 4 GCA  
- **ID:** 1919  
- **Extension Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** Pre Loader  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Once  

**Summary:**  
This extension performs a hostname check to ensure that the current website is "www.lloydsbankinggroup.com". If the condition passes, it dynamically injects the Google Tag Manager (GTM) script into the page, using the GTM container ID "GTM-T488GLF7". This allows the GTM library to be loaded at an early stage (pre loader), ensuring that GTM events can be captured as soon as possible during the page lifecycle.

---

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables and Structures

- **window.location.hostname:**  
  This global object property is used to retrieve the current host domain of the webpage.

- **Anonymous Self-Invoking Function:**  
  The code uses an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) to encapsulate the logic for injecting the GTM script into the page. This ensures that the variables inside the function do not conflict with the global scope.

- **Parameters of the IIFE:**  
  The function is called with the following parameters:
  - `w`: Corresponds to the `window` object.
  - `d`: The `document` object.
  - `s`: The tag name to be created (in this case, 'script').
  - `l`: The name of the data layer (default is 'dataLayer').
  - `i`: The GTM container ID, which in this extension is set to "GTM-T488GLF7".

### Logic Flow

1. **Hostname Check:**  
   The code begins by verifying whether `window.location.hostname` exactly matches "www.lloydsbankinggroup.com". This ensures that the GTM code gets executed only on the designated domain.

2. **GTM Injection:**  
   If the hostname matches:
   - An IIFE is executed, which:
     - Initialises the data layer by creating an array if it does not already exist.
     - Pushes an event object into the data layer with the current time and an event name ('gtm.js') to mark the GTM start.
     - Creates a new `<script>` element (`j`) and sets it to load asynchronously.
     - Configures the script's `src` attribute to point to the GTM script URL with the container ID included.
     - Inserts the script into the document just before the first existing `<script>` element, ensuring it is loaded appropriately.

### Dependencies

- **Global Objects:**  
  The script relies on standard browser global objects, such as `window` and `document`.  
- **External Script:**  
  It depends on the availability of the GTM script from "https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtm.js".

---

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Scenario

When a user visits "https://www.lloydsbankinggroup.com":
- The condition `window.location.hostname === "www.lloydsbankinggroup.com"` evaluates to true.
- The IIFE is executed, initialising the data layer and loading the GTM script.
- GTM is loaded asynchronously, allowing subsequent tracking events to be captured by the GTM container specified.

### Edge Condition

If a user visits a subdomain or a different domain, for example "blog.lloydsbankinggroup.com" or "www.example.com":
- The hostname check fails.
- The GTM script is not injected.
- No GTM events will be fired from this extension, ensuring that GTM runs only on the intended domain.

---

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Hardcoded Hostname:**  
  The domain check is tight, meaning that variations in subdomains or protocol (HTTP vs HTTPS) will result in the GTM script not being loaded.  
- **Single Execution:**  
  The extension is set to "Run Once". Any subsequent dynamic changes to the domain or page reloads within the same session will not re-trigger the GTM injection.
- **Dependency on External Script:**  
  If "https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtm.js" is unreachable or blocked by network policies, GTM will fail to load.
- **Potential Interference:**  
  Ensure no other Tealium extensions or scripts modify the `dataLayer` object or overwrite the GTM container ID before this extension runs.

---

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks for Document Elements:**  
  Although the code assumes that a script tag exists in the document (`f`), it may be prudent to ensure that `f` is not null before attempting to insert the GTM script.
  
- **Modularisation:**  
  Consider wrapping the GTM injection functionality within a named function. This could improve readability and facilitate unit testing.
  
- **Explicit Variable Declarations:**  
  Maintain strict ES5 compliant coding practices by ensuring variable declarations with `var` are used consistently. (Note: Avoid ES6 features such as `let`, `const`, arrow functions, and template literals as per ES5 support requirements).

Example Refactor (ES5 Compatible):

--------------------------------------------------
/* 
  Function: loadGTM
  Purpose: Injects the GTM script into the page.
*/
function loadGTM(win, doc, scriptTag, dataLayerName, containerId) {
  win[dataLayerName] = win[dataLayerName] || [];
  win[dataLayerName].push({ 'gtm.start': new Date().getTime(), event: 'gtm.js'});

  var firstScript = doc.getElementsByTagName(scriptTag)[0];
  if (!firstScript) {
    // Fallback: Append script to head if no script tag found.
    firstScript = doc.getElementsByTagName('head')[0];
  }
  
  var newScript = doc.createElement(scriptTag);
  newScript.async = true;
  var dlParam = dataLayerName !== 'dataLayer' ? '&l=' + dataLayerName : '';
  newScript.src = 'https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtm.js?id=' + containerId + dlParam;
  firstScript.parentNode.insertBefore(newScript, firstScript);
}

// Execution condition checking hostname before loading GTM
if (window.location.hostname === "www.lloydsbankinggroup.com") {
  loadGTM(window, document, 'script', 'dataLayer', 'GTM-T488GLF7');
}
--------------------------------------------------

- **Code Comments:**  
  Enhance inline comments to explain the purpose of each step, which aids in understanding and future maintenance.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Testing:**  
  Regularly test the extension across all supported browsers to ensure that:
  - The hostname check is robust.
  - The GTM script loads correctly without affecting the user experience.
  
- **Change Management:**  
  Document any changes made to the GTM container ID or the injection logic. Maintain versioning of the extension code in your source control system.

- **Stakeholder Communication:**  
  Share updates with the analytics and development teams, especially when modifications to the domain strategy or tracking requirements occur.

- **Ownership:**  
  Clearly define the team or individual responsible for maintaining this extension. Establish a schedule for periodic reviews (e.g. quarterly) to check compatibility with updated browser standards and external dependencies.

- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  Include tests for:
  - Hostname validation.
  - Successful insertion of the GTM script.
  - Handling cases where the document structure may not meet assumptions (e.g., missing script element).
  
By adhering to these guidelines, the GTM 4 GCA extension will remain robust, maintainable, and effective in delivering the required functionality.
