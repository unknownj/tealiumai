# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: Sync Script

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name**: Sync Script
- **ID**: 1923
- **Type**: Javascript Code
- **Scope**: utag Sync
- **Execution Frequency**: Run Once

### Summary
The Sync Script is a Tealium iQ extension that enables synchronisation of operations across various components of the Tealium environment. By setting the `LBGAnalytics.syncExtensions` flag to `true`, it ensures that any relevant analytics extensions are executed in a consistent and coordinated manner. This helps in maintaining data integrity when dealing with multiple data layers and services that require synchronized access to the same data. 

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- `LBGAnalytics.syncExtensions`: A boolean flag that, when set to `true`, triggers synchronisation processes across analytics extensions.

### Logic Flow
1. The extension sets the `LBGAnalytics.syncExtensions` variable to `true`.
2. This change denotes that the data analytics methods or extensions will run synchronously, allowing for reliable data handling.

### Dependencies
- **Global Objects**: This extension relies on the global object `LBGAnalytics`. Make sure that this object is defined elsewhere in your Tealium setup.
- **Tealium Libraries**: No specific external libraries are required for this extension; it operates within the standard Tealium iQ environment.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Conditions
- When the extension is activated, any subsequent analytics events (e.g., page views, user interactions) are processed in synchronised order, which can prevent data overriding or missed events.

### Edge Conditions
- If `LBGAnalytics` is not defined prior to this extension running, attempting to set `LBGAnalytics.syncExtensions` to `true` will result in a JavaScript error. To prevent issues, ensure that any dependent scripts are loaded before this extension executes.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Dependency on Global Object**: If the `LBGAnalytics` object is not instantiated correctly elsewhere in the Tealium setup, the extension will fail silently or lead to undesired behaviour.
- **Conflicts with Other Extensions**: If multiple extensions attempt to modify the same property on `LBGAnalytics`, it could lead to unpredictable outcomes. It is advisable to devise a strategy for managing shared global state effectively.
- **Synchronous Execution Drawbacks**: Running extensions in sync can lead to increased load times and may impact performance, particularly if an extension has a prolonged execution time.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks**: Although it is noted that `eventType` (string) and `eventPayload` (object) are guaranteed to be present, consider adding checks for `LBGAnalytics` to ensure it is defined before setting properties on it.
  
- **Code Style and Modularity**: For maintainability, consider breaking out functionality into smaller, modular functions if the logic expands in future iterations.

- **Commenting**: Adequately comment the code for clarity, especially when working in a team environment where the original developer may not be available for explanations.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance**: Regular checks should be conducted to ensure that the `LBGAnalytics` object is still being used as expected in the broader codebase and that its usage aligns with best practices.
  
- **Ownership**: Assign a developer or team responsible for overseeing this extension. Documentation should be kept up-to-date alongside any changes made to the codebase.
  
- **Testing Guidelines**: Develop unit and integration tests to validate the expected behaviour of the extension under various scenarios. Testing should include cases where the `LBGAnalytics` object is either present or absent.
