# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: Force-Send Abandonment Application States

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name**: Force-Send Abandonment Application States
- **ID**: 1925
- **Type**: Javascript Code
- **Scope**: After Load Rules
- **Execution Frequency**: Run Always

### Summary
This Tealium iQ extension is designed to monitor application state transitions related to user abandonment. It triggers a data layer event to send tracking information to analytics services when an application state is marked as "Abandoned". The extension ensures that the abandonment state is communicated correctly by only sending the event if the current application state is not already marked as abandoned, thus preventing duplicate events.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- `eventType`: A string representing the type of event being handled.
- `eventPayload`: An object containing additional contextual data related to the event being processed (including the `ApplicationState`).

### Logic Flow
- The code immediately checks whether the `eventType` is `"link"` and that the `ApplicationState` is `"Abandoned"` while ensuring it is not already set in the global data layer.
- If the conditions are met, a `setTimeout` function is invoked to delay the execution by 100 milliseconds.
- Inside the `setTimeout`, the code calls `window.utag.track()` with the event name `"statetransition"` and includes the `eventPayload` data for analytics tracking. Additionally, a configuration object is provided with unique identifiers for the event.

### Dependencies
This extension relies on the global LBGAnalytics object and the utag object from Tealium, specifically the `utag.track()` method for tracking analytics events. The code assumes that the `LBGAnalytics` datalayer is correctly populated and accessible when the function executes.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Scenario
1. **User Action**: A user links to a section of the application, causing the `eventType` to be `"link"`.
2. **Application State**: The application's current `ApplicationState` is changed to `"Abandoned"`.
3. **Execution**: The extension evaluates the condition:
   - Since the condition holds true (eventType is "link" and ApplicationState is "Abandoned"), the timeout function executes and a `statetransition` event is sent to the analytics server with the event payload.

### Edge Condition
If another part of the code attempts to set the `ApplicationState` to `"Abandoned"` simultaneously:
- If the timing and order allow, the event may be sent again, violating the intended check.
- This could lead to confusion or data loss in the analytics reporting, since multiple signals may be sent for the same abandonment state.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Duplicate Tracking**: If multiple processes trigger events concurrently, it may lead to unintended duplicate analytics events since the extension does not lock or queue such operations.
- **Global Dependency**: The reliance on the `LBGAnalytics` global object means that if it is not available or instantiated properly, the extension will fail silently.
- **Delayed Execution**: The use of `setTimeout` introduces delays that may cause mismatched timings with other scripts, potentially leading to race conditions in event tracking.
- **Conflicts**: There could be potential conflicts with other Tealium extensions that handle state transitions or links. Care should be taken to ensure they do not interfere with each other's functionality.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Code Style**: Maintain consistent formatting and spacing to enhance readability and maintainability. Each logical block should be clearly delineated.
- **Modularisation**: Consider breaking out the `utag.track` call into a separate function. This would improve testability and isolate tracking logic from condition checks.
- **Logging Mechanisms**: Implement console logs to help trace execution, especially during development or when troubleshooting. This aids in identifying issues or understanding execution flow.
- **Error Handling**: While not explicitly requested, consider adding error handling for the `utag.track()` call to catch any failures in sending events to the analytics platform.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ownership**: Assign a specific team member(s) to manage and oversee this extension, ensuring they stay informed about updates to dependencies or related extensions.
- **Testing Guidelines**: Regularly validate the extension's functionality across different environments (e.g., development, staging, and production) to ensure it behaves as expected under various conditions.
- **Documentation Updates**: Keep this documentation updated with any changes made to the code logic or dependencies to ensure that future developers understand the extension's purpose and functionality.
