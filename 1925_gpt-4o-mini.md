# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation

## 1. Extension Overview
- **Name:** Force-Send Abandonment Application States
- **ID:** 1925
- **Type:** Javascript Code
- **Scope:** After Load Rules
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Always

### Summary
This Tealium iQ extension is designed to monitor application states and send a specific event (`statetransition`) when an abandonment state is detected. The extension verifies if the current application state has changed to `Abandoned` without already being marked as such in the datalayer. When this condition is met, the extension triggers a delayed event that facilitates the tracking of user interactions effectively, ensuring accurate abandonment behaviour is captured.

## 2. Code Explanation
### Key Variables
- **`eventType`**: Expected to be a string that represents the type of event (e.g., "link").
- **`eventPayload`**: An object containing various application state data, specifically with an attribute `ApplicationState`.

### Logic Flow
1. The extension checks if the `eventType` is `"link"` and if `eventPayload.ApplicationState` is `"Abandoned"`.
2. It further checks whether the datalayer value for `ApplicationState` is not already marked as `"Abandoned"`.
3. If all conditions are satisfied, it invokes a `setTimeout` to delay execution for 100 milliseconds before sending the tracking event.
4. The tracking event is sent with `window.utag.track`, including:
   - **Event Name:** `statetransition`
   - **Payload:** Contains `eventPayload` data.
   - **Configuration Object:** Specifies a unique ID for tracking via a `uids` array (e.g., `[1222]`, likely referring to a Celebrus tag ID).

### Dependencies
- This extension relies on the existence of:
  - `LBGAnalytics.datalayer`: A global object that manages the datalayer for retrieving application state values.
  - `window.utag`: The global Tealium function used for tracking events.

## 3. Usage Examples
### Normal Flow
1. **Event Trigger**: A link click occurs which sets `eventType` to `"link"` and `eventPayload` sets `ApplicationState` to `"Abandoned"`.
2. **Data Layer Check**: If the current datalayer does not reflect `ApplicationState` as `"Abandoned"`, the event is tracked after a delay of 100 milliseconds.

### Edge Conditions
- **Consecutive Abandonments**: 
  - If multiple `Abandoned` states are rapidly fired (e.g., in a user session), the extension should only trigger one event since the datalayer check prevents duplicate tracking.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas
- **Execution Timing**: The delay in triggering the event can lead to loss of data if the page navigates or reloads before the timeout completes.
- **Other Extensions**: If there are other extensions that manipulate the datalayer or alter the `eventPayload`, they may conflict with the conditions checked in this extension.
- **Performance Impact**: The usage of `setTimeout` can lead to performance issues if there are excessive events firing quickly, as it could lead to cases where many delayed events are queued up.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring
- **Code Style Improvements**:
  - Consider breaking down the main execution function into smaller functions for enhanced readability.
  - Use meaningful variable names to improve code clarity.
  
- **Defensive Programming**:
  - Although `eventType` and `eventPayload` are guaranteed to be present, checks could be implemented to validate the expected structure of `eventPayload`.

- **Modularisation**:
  - Wrap the logic in an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) to avoid global scope pollution. Current code structure does this, but ensure consistency across the module for maintainability.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes
- **Ownership**: Assign a team or individual responsible for the ongoing maintenance of this extension, including updates based on changes in the tracking requirements.
- **Testing Guidelines**:
  - Regularly test the extension across different user journeys to ensure that it behaves as expected, especially in scenarios involving page navigation or state changes.
  - Implement rigorous logging during development to catch any unexpected behaviours or errors during event triggers.
