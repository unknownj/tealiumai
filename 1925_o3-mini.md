# Force-Send Abandonment Application States Extension Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the "Force-Send Abandonment Application States" Tealium iQ extension. It covers the extension’s purpose, inner workings, usage examples, known limitations, refactoring suggestions, and maintenance guidelines.

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Force-Send Abandonment Application States  
- **Extension ID:** 1925  
- **Tealium Extension Identifier:** 100036  
- **Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** After Load Rules  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Always  

**Summary:**  
This extension is designed to monitor specific data layer events. When an event of type "link" occurs and the event payload indicates that the application state is "Abandoned"—while the global data layer value for ApplicationState is not already set to "Abandoned"—the extension triggers a delayed (100ms) utag.track call. This track call sends a "statetransition" event along with the payload data. The configuration includes a Celebrus tag ID (1222) to ensure that the abandonment state is captured correctly. This is typically used to force-send abandonment-related information in environments where asynchronous event propagation might otherwise fail to capture the desired state.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Variables & Parameters

- **a (eventType):**  
  Represents the type of the event received. The code specifically checks for the value "link".  

- **b (eventPayload):**  
  Represents the payload of the event which is expected to be an object containing state-related properties, including "ApplicationState".

### Logic Flow

1. **Initial Condition Check:**
   - The IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) accepts two parameters: eventType and eventPayload.
   - It checks if:
     - `eventType` (variable a) is equal to "link".
     - `eventPayload.ApplicationState` (variable b) is exactly "Abandoned".
     - The value obtained from `LBGAnalytics.datalayer.get("ApplicationState")` is not "Abandoned".  
   
2. **Delayed Event Trigger:**
   - If the above conditions are met, a `setTimeout` is employed with a 100ms delay.
   - After the delay, `window.utag.track` is called with:
     - **event:** "statetransition"
     - **data:** The passed event payload (variable b)
     - **cfg:** An object containing:
       - `cb: undefined` (no callback provided)
       - `uids: [1222]` – an array containing the Celebrus tag ID.

### Global Dependencies

- **LBGAnalytics:**  
  The extension uses `LBGAnalytics.datalayer.get()` to retrieve the current value of "ApplicationState" from the data layer.

- **utag:**  
  The utag object (assumed to be available on the window) is utilised for event tracking via `window.utag.track`.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Normal Operation

**Input:**  
- eventType: "link"  
- eventPayload: { ApplicationState: "Abandoned", ... }  
- Global data layer (via LBGAnalytics.datalayer.get("ApplicationState")) returns a value other than "Abandoned".

**Behaviour:**  
- The condition in the extension evaluates to true.
- After a 100ms delay, `window.utag.track` is invoked.
- The event "statetransition" is sent with the event payload and configuration containing the Celebrus tag ID 1222.

### Scenario 2: Edge Case – Global State Already Abandoned

**Input:**  
- eventType: "link"  
- eventPayload: { ApplicationState: "Abandoned", ... }  
- Global data layer returns "Abandoned".

**Behaviour:**  
- The condition `LBGAnalytics.datalayer.get("ApplicationState") !== "Abandoned"` fails.
- The extension does not initiate the delayed utag.track call.
  
### Scenario 3: Non-matching Event Type

**Input:**  
- eventType: "click"  
- eventPayload: { ApplicationState: "Abandoned", ... }

**Behaviour:**  
- As the event type is not "link", the initial condition fails.
- No utag.track call is made.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Dependency on Global Objects:**
  - The extension requires the availability and correct behaviour of `LBGAnalytics.datalayer.get()` and `window.utag.track`. Any changes to these globals or their APIs may break the extension.
  
- **Timing Issues:**
  - The use of `setTimeout` (with a fixed delay of 100ms) might not be robust in cases of rapid page transitions or when the page unloads before the delay expires.

- **Conditional Reliance:**
  - The extension specifically triggers for events with the "link" type. If other event types should also trigger abandonment tracking, the logic will need to be modified.

- **Potential Conflicts:**
  - Other Tealium iQ extensions or scripts that modify the `LBGAnalytics` object or the utag tracking functionality could interfere with its operation.
  - Ensure consistent Celebrus tag ID usage; conflicting tag IDs in other configurations may result in unexpected behaviour.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Code Clarity:**
  - Break the condition-checking logic into smaller helper functions to improve readability and maintainability.
  
- **Modularisation:**
  - Consider encapsulating the utag.track call within a dedicated function (e.g. `sendStateTransitionEvent`) to isolate the tracking logic.
  
- **Defensive Checks (Where Applicable):**
  - Although the availability of `eventType` (string) and `eventPayload` (object) is guaranteed, future maintenance should include comments specifying expected structures.
  - Validate that global objects (`LBGAnalytics.datalayer` and `window.utag`) exist before attempting to call their methods, particularly if the code might be repurposed.

- **Commenting & Documentation:**
  - Enhance inline comments to clarify the purpose of magic values (e.g. the 100ms timeout and the Celebrus tag ID 1222).
  - Maintain versioning comments to track changes in logic tied to business requirements.

- **ES5 Compliance:**
  - Ensure that any new code maintains ES5 syntax; avoid ES2015/ES6 syntax such as arrow functions, template literals, or block-scoped variables (let/const) as per project requirements.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**
  - Regularly review the dependencies on `LBGAnalytics` and `utag` to ensure compatibility with updates.
  - Monitor the performance impact of the delayed call, especially during peak traffic times.

- **Ownership:**
  - Identify a clear owner or team responsible for the extension, ensuring that any changes in business logic or external library updates are reviewed and tested.

- **Testing Guidelines:**
  - Develop unit tests to simulate various event conditions:
    - Valid "link" events with different ApplicationState values.
    - Edge cases where the global ApplicationState is already set to "Abandoned".
  - Integrate automated testing within the CI/CD pipeline to catch regressions.

- **Documentation Updates:**
  - Keep this documentation in sync with any code changes.
  - Consider adding diagrams or flowcharts if the logic becomes more complex over time.

This documentation should aid developers and stakeholders in understanding, maintaining, and evolving the "Force-Send Abandonment Application States" extension. Regular reviews of both the code and its documentation are recommended to ensure ongoing coherence with the overall Tealium iQ implementation and business requirements.
