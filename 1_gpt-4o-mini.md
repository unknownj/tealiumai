# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: LBG : BLR : Set : Merge Data Layer with CLOVA3

## Extension Overview
- **Name:** LBG : BLR : Set : Merge Data Layer with CLOVA3
- **ID:** 100036
- **Type:** Javascript Code
- **Scope:** Before Load Rules
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Always

### Summary
This extension merges the `window.clova3.datalayer` object into the event payload (`b`). By iterating over the keys in `window.clova3.datalayer`, it assigns those keys in the event payload object (`b`) if they are not already present. The extension also logs analytic events for debugging purposes and supports the integration of the `window.LBGAnalytics` library if available.

## Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- **`datalayer`:** Represents the `window.clova3.datalayer` object containing analytics information.
- **`pl`:** A new payload object that will hold the merged parameters from `b` and `datalayer`.
- **`plb`:** A flag indicating whether to continue copying values from `b` into `pl` (stops when keys starting with `cp.` are encountered).

### Logic Flow
1. **Initialisation:**
   - The number of analytics events is incremented and stored in `window.analytics_event_count`.
   - An empty object (`pl`) is created to store the payload that will later be merged with the `datalayer`.

2. **Payload Copying:**
   - The code iterates over the keys in the event payload (`b`):
     - If a key starts with `cp.`, copying stops.
     - Otherwise, the key/value pairs from `b` are copied to `pl`.

3. **Debug Event Logging:**
   - A `debug_event` object is constructed with the current event count, event type, timestamp, and the payloads, which is then pushed to `window.analytics_event_log`.

4. **Merging Data Layer:**
   - Each key in the `datalayer` is checked against `b`. If a key does not exist in `b`, it is added.

5. **LBGAnalytics Integration:**
   - If the `window.LBGAnalytics` object exists, a new instance of `QALRP` is created, allowing additional processing functions to be registered.

6. **Response Handler Registration:**
   - If `b.Q.if.registerHandler` is available, a handler is registered that processes a `dataObject` to copy its string, number, or boolean values into `b`.

### Dependencies
- Relies on `window.clova3.datalayer` for data merging.
- Integrates with `window.LBGAnalytics` if it is present.

## Usage Examples

### Normal Conditions
1. If the `window.clova3.datalayer` contains the following data:
   ```javascript
   window.clova3.datalayer = { "userId": "12345", "sessionId": "abcde" }
   ```
   And the event payload `b` is:
   ```javascript
   var b = { "eventCategory": "pageview" };
   ```
   After running this extension, `b` will be:
   ```javascript
   { "eventCategory": "pageview", "userId": "12345", "sessionId": "abcde" }
   ```

### Edge Conditions
1. If `b` already contains a key `userId`:
   ```javascript
   var b = { "eventCategory": "pageview", "userId": "67890" };
   ```
   After merging with `datalayer`, the `userId` will remain as `"67890"` and `b` will be:
   ```javascript
   { "eventCategory": "pageview", "userId": "67890", "sessionId": "abcde" }
   ```

## Known Limitations & Gotchas
- The extension assumes the existence of `window.clova3.datalayer`. If it is absent, the merging process will not occur, potentially leading to incomplete event payloads.
- The presence of keys in both the `datalayer` and payload `b` can lead to overwriting of values, which may not be intended.
- The debug logging functionality may consume additional memory if numerous events are processed without monitoring.

## Recommendations for Refactoring
- **Error Handling:** Although errors are caught in a generic way, it may be beneficial to include logging or notifications for developers to alert them when critical processes fail.
- **Code Style:** Use consistent indentation and whitespace for better readability.
- **Modularisation:** Break down the script into functions for better maintainability and testability. For example, separate the debug logging and merging processes.
- **Comments:** Expand comments to clarify steps within complex logic flows.

## Maintenance & Further Notes
- **Ownership:** Ensure a dedicated developer or team is responsible for maintaining and updating this extension. Document every modification made to track changes effectively.
- **Testing:** Rigorously test the extension in various scenarios, particularly around the integration of the `LBGAnalytics` library and edge conditions. Testing should encompass unit and integration tests.
- **Update Notes:** Keep track of external changes to `window.clova3.datalayer` and `window.LBGAnalytics`, as any changes to these structures may necessitate updates to this extension.
