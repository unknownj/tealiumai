# Pegasus V2 : Lookups Extension Documentation

This document provides a detailed overview of the Pegasus V2 : Lookups extension, explaining its purpose, key code elements, usage examples, limitations and recommendations for improvements. The documentation is written in British English and follows GitHub Flavoured Markdown conventions.

──────────────────────────────────────────────
## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Pegasus V2 : Lookups  
- **Extension ID:** 2094  
- **Extension Type:** Advanced Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** 1656, 1655, 1611, 1783  
- **Execution Frequency:**  
  - This extension is executed for every event that matches the scope rules.  
  - It is triggered during the Tealium event processing lifecycle and executed once per applicable event.

**Summary:**  
The extension initialises two main lookup structures used for mapping conversion values to predefined criteria. The first structure, named `structureLkps`, defines the lookup keys (or criteria) that describe the expected event variables. The second, `lookupTable`, is a master table that maps specific lookup criteria and event-type combinations to corresponding tag conversion values. This is used to drive tag firing and conversion tracking (e.g. for Google Floodlight, Google Ads, and Microsoft or other conversion systems) in a standardised way.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables & Objects:

- **`b["structureLkps"]`:**  
  - An object containing a set of keys (e.g. "_1", "_2", …, "_10") which map to arrays.  
  - Each array lists the names of the lookup variables (for example, "Brand", "PegasusTagName", "JourneyName", etc.) which are used to decode the event details.
  
- **`b["lookupTable"]`:**  
  - An array containing a series of mappings.  
  - Each mapping is represented as a two-element array:
    - The first element is a string that follows a specific structure. It combines a lookup type (corresponding to one of the keys in structureLkps), an event type (such as "Page", "Event", "Timed"), and additional lookup details delimited by special characters (such as "!", ":" and sometimes using the "!" delimiter again to separate lookup variables and event IDs).
    - The second element is a string detailing conversion tag identifiers and parameters. The conversion mapping typically follows these formats:
      - For Google Floodlight tags: `gfl!dc_src!dc_type!dc_cat[!dc_act]`  
      - For Google Ads tags: `gad!conversion_id!conversion_label`  
      - For Microsoft tags: `mau! [conversion action]`
  
### Logic Flow:

1. **Initialisation:**  
   - The extension is wrapped inside an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) to avoid polluting the global namespace.
   - The function’s parameters (`a`, `b`, and `u`) represent objects passed by Tealium. The `b` object is used to attach our lookup definitions.

2. **Setting Lookup Structures:**  
   - The object `b["structureLkps"]` is declared and initialised with hardcoded keys and associated arrays of lookup variable names.
   - Similarly, `b["lookupTable"]` is populated with a comprehensive list of mappings. Each mapping in the lookup table is a static configuration that pairs a composite key (the criteria) with conversion tracking details.

3. **Processing Data:**  
   - While there are no explicit loops or conditional branches in the code, the expectation is that downstream event processing (handled by Tealium or additional script logic) will reference these lookup structures to match incoming event details against the criteria and retrieve the corresponding conversion instructions.
   - The code depends on the provided global objects (`eventType`, `eventPayload`, and `tagObject` passed via parameters) and assumes that these objects are already available and correctly formatted.

### Dependencies:
- **Global Objects:**  
  - The extension relies on a global or external object represented by the parameter `b` (commonly used within the Tealium iQ environment).
  - The code assumes that `eventType` (a string) and `eventPayload` (an object) are present and correctly formatted, as these are guaranteed by the Tealium platform.
- **Tealium Environment:**  
  - Execution is governed by the Tealium event processing order and by the scope defined for the extension via the load rules.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Operation:
- **Page Event Matching:**  
  Suppose an event is fired for a page view with the URL ‘www.learnwithhalifax.co.uk/money/i-want-to-budget-and-save/’. The lookup key might be constructed as `_10!Page!www.learnwithhalifax.co.uk/money/i-want-to-budget-and-save/`.
  - The extension looks up this key in `b["lookupTable"]` and retrieves the corresponding conversion string (e.g. `'gad!454995991!JPAnCLW1w5QZEJfg-tgB:mau!view_item:meta!ViewContent'`).
  - Downstream scripts then use this conversion string to trigger the appropriate conversion tag (Google Ads, Microsoft Ads, etc.).

### Edge Conditions:
- **Multiple Tag IDs in Payload:**  
  - The lookup table notes that payloads may contain event IDs for multiple tags, each section delimited by a colon (`:`). An edge scenario is if multiple conversion systems are intended to be fired simultaneously (e.g. Google Floodlight, Google Ads, and Microsoft).  
  - The conversion string will contain multiple segments separated by colons. Downstream processing needs to be capable of splitting and processing each segment accordingly.
  
- **Mismatched or Incomplete Lookup Keys:**  
  - If an event does not fully match any of the preconfigured lookup keys, it is expected that no conversion mapping is applied.  
  - There is no fallback logic in the extension, so events with misformatted or unrecognised lookup criteria will simply not trigger any conversion tags.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Static Data Configuration:**  
  - The lookup structures are entirely hardcoded. Any change in tag mappings or criteria requires a code update. There is no dynamic loading or fallback mechanism.
  
- **Parsing Complexity:**  
  - The composite keys in `lookupTable` incorporate multiple segments combined using delimiters (`!` and `:`), which can make troubleshooting and manual updates error prone.
  
- **No Error Handling:**  
  - The code does not include checks for data consistency or logging. If an unexpected key format is introduced, it may fail silently without alerting the developer.
  
- **Potential Conflicts:**  
  - If additional Tealium extensions also modify the same global object (`b`), conflicts could arise if naming conventions or key usage collide.
  - Be aware of potential clashes with external scripts that might utilise the same global properties.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Code Modularity & Organisation:**  
  - Consider splitting the configuration data (the lookup table and structure definitions) into separate JSON files or modules. This would improve readability, making it easier to update mappings without altering the primary logic.
  
- **Defensive Checks & Logging:**  
  - Although eventType and eventPayload are guaranteed to be available, defensive coding (such as verifying that `b["lookupTable"]` is properly formatted) may help during debugging or future changes.
  - Adding minimal logging in development (for example, console messages when a lookup match is not found) might assist troubleshooting when an expected conversion is not triggered.
  
- **Maintain Strict ES5 Syntax:**  
  - As ES5 support is required, avoid the use of ES2015+ features such as arrow functions, let/const declarations, or template literals. Maintain the existing syntax to ensure compatibility.
  
- **Comment & Documentation Inline:**  
  - Augment the code comments with inline documentation for each major block explaining what the section does, making it easier for developers to understand and maintain the script.
  
- **Unit Testing & Versioning:**  
  - Introduce unit tests (if the platform permits) for verifying that lookup keys correctly return expected conversion strings.  
  - Utilize source control and versioning to track changes so that any modifications to the mapping tables can be audited.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  - The lookup data is static; therefore, any change to the conversion systems, tag identifiers or criteria should be centrally updated in this extension.
  - Developers should review the lookup configurations regularly to ensure they are in sync with business changes and third-party conversion tag updates.

- **Ownership & Testing:**  
  - Assign clear ownership (e.g. a member of the digital analytics or marketing technology team) responsible for maintaining and updating these mappings.
  - Prior to upgrading or making changes, test the extension in a staging environment to verify that the correct conversion tags fire under real-world conditions.
  
- **Documentation & Change Log:**  
  - Maintain a change log (either within the code comments or in a separate document) that records why and when lookup values were modified.
  - Regularly review and audit the extension to ensure compliance with performance and data quality standards.
