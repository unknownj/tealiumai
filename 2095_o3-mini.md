# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: Pegasus V2 – GAD Functions

This document provides a comprehensive overview and explanation of the "Pegasus V2 : GAD Functions" Tealium iQ extension, including its code structure, usage examples, known limitations, refactoring recommendations, and maintenance guidelines.

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Pegasus V2 : GAD Functions  
- **Extension ID:** 2095  
- **Extension Type:** Advanced Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** 1656  
- **Execution Frequency:**  
  - The code is executed on each relevant event. It iterates over a lookup table (provided in the event payload or global tagObject) and, based on eligibility rules, fires a Google Ads conversion event.

**Summary:**  
This extension is designed to trigger Google Ads (GAD) conversion events using the gtag function. It processes lookup table records from the event payload, checks eligibility conditions based on dynamic rules, and sets up the conversion call. Depending on the trigger type (immediate page load, delayed timer, or DOM event), it fires the conversion event at the appropriate moment. The extension also handles consent mode by removing sensitive identifiers if the user has not provided consent.

---

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables and Parameters
- **Global Objects:**  
  - `gtag`: Function used to send Google Ads conversion events.
  - `LBGAnalytics`: A global object providing utilities such as event handling and cookie decoding.
- **Input Values:** Passed as parameters into the Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE):
  - `a`: Typically the event type.
  - `b`: The event payload containing key values like `ApplicationID`, `JourneyName`, lookup tables (`lookupTable`), and structure lookups (`structureLkps`).
  - `u`: The tagObject (unused directly in this code sample).

### Function-by-Function Logic Flow

1. **gtag_report_conversion(acc, id, url):**  
   - Prepares a payload for the conversion event using parameters from the event payload (`b`).
   - Includes additional details such as application and journey data if available.
   - Handles Google Consent mode by stripping sensitive identifiers if consent is not given (`LBGAnalytics.privacy.decodeCookie()`).
   - Sends the conversion event via `gtag` and optionally redirects the user if a URL is provided.

2. **unpackStr(TagValues, delim):**  
   - Splits an input string (`TagValues`) using the provided delimiter (`delim`).
   - Returns an array of substrings.  
   - Used to break apart lookup values, trigger parameters, and tag information.

3. **createElig(arr):**  
   - Maps an input array (`arr`) to an object using a reference lookup array from `b.structureLkps`.
   - Constructs an eligibility array (`eligArr`) by pairing lookup names with their associated values.
   - Returns an array consisting of the eligibility array and a trigger parameter extracted from the input array.
   - This eligibility array is later used to determine if the conversion event should fire.

4. **unpackTag(arr):**  
   - Splits a two-element array into separate `input` and `output` strings.
   - These strings represent the rules (input conditions) and the conversion tag details (output information).

5. **findTag(currentTag):**  
   - Processes each tag in a colon-delimited list.
   - Checks if the tag begins with the required identifier ("gad").
   - Returns the relevant portion of the tag parameters if found.

6. **setTags(GAD_src, GAD_label, trigger):**  
   - Determines how and when to trigger the conversion event:
     - **Immediate ("Page"):** Fires the conversion immediately.
     - **Delayed ("Timed"):** Sets a timeout based on a specified delay before firing the event.
     - **Event-Based ("Event"):** Attaches an event listener to a specified DOM element that triggers the conversion when the event occurs. Also supports filtering based on element text content.
   - Calls the `gtag_report_conversion` with the appropriate parameters based on trigger type.

7. **runLookups(currentArr):**  
   - The primary function that iterates over each entry in `b.lookupTable`.
   - Unpacks the lookup table record using `unpackTag`, then further splits the eligibility conditions and tag information.
   - Searches for a valid GAD-related tag using the `findTag` function.
   - Uses `createElig` to generate the eligibility rules and trigger information.
   - Tests if all eligibility conditions are met (using the `every` method on `eligArr` with an external function `clova3.Q`).
   - If eligible, extracts the GAD conversion source and label, and calls `setTags` to schedule or trigger the conversion event.

### Dependencies on Global Objects / Libraries
- **LBGAnalytics:**  
  - Provides helper functions such as `$` (presumably jQuery or a similar selector mechanism) and `privacy.decodeCookie()`.
  - Is used to attach event listeners and handle DOM querying.
- **gtag:**  
  - External function assumed to be loaded in the global namespace for sending Google conversion events.
- **clova3.Q:**  
  - A function used to evaluate each eligibility condition in the eligibility array. Its exact implementation is assumed to be defined elsewhere.
- **Browser Globals:**  
  - `window` is used to perform redirections and set timeouts.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Scenario
1. **Input Data Flow:**  
   - Tealium passes an event payload (`b`) that includes:
     - A lookup table (`lookupTable`) containing pairs of input conditions and conversion tag details.
     - Structure lookups (`structureLkps`) defining how to map conditions.
     - Application, journey, and product details.
   - The code iterates through each record in the lookup table.
  
2. **Eligibility & Conversion Firing:**  
   - For a record where the input string (delimited by "!") meets all the requirements (verified by `eligArr.every(clova3.Q)`), the corresponding GAD conversion tag (identified by "gad") is extracted.
   - Depending on the trigger specified (e.g., "Page", "Timed:3000", or "Event:#button:click"), the code either:
     - Fires conversion immediately.
     - Waits a set number of milliseconds before firing via `setTimeout`.
     - Attaches an event listener to the specified DOM element which then remotely fires the conversion when the event is triggered.

### Edge Conditions
- **Consent Mode Handling:**  
  - If the decoded cookie status from `LBGAnalytics.privacy.decodeCookie()` is not within the acceptable consent codes (e.g. "y" or "t"), sensitive parameters such as `order_id` and `application_id` are removed from the conversion payload.
  
- **Missing or Inconsistent Tag Data:**  
  - If a lookup record does not contain a valid "gad" tag in its output string, the conversion event is not triggered.
  - The code checks for the presence of necessary values and will not execute the conversion if conditions are not strictly met.

- **Event Listener Timing:**  
  - For "Event" triggers, if the required DOM element is not found or the event type does not occur, the conversion event will not fire.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Global Dependencies:**  
  - The extension relies on the availability and correct functioning of global objects (`LBGAnalytics`, `gtag`, and `clova3.Q`). If these are not present or misconfigured, the conversion event may not be sent.
  
- **Consent Mode:**  
  - The logic to remove identifiers when there is no consent is based solely on checking a cookie’s status code. If the structure of the cookie or decoding method changes, this logic may fail.

- **Event Listener Bloat:**  
  - If multiple lookup records create event listeners on the same DOM element, there is potential for duplicate event handling or conflicts.

- **Looping Constructs:**  
  - The use of "for…in" loops to iterate over arrays may inadvertently include inherited properties if the prototype chain is not tightly controlled.

- **Error Handling:**  
  - Try-catch blocks exist within event listener callbacks, but not all possible errors (such as those during eligibility checks) may be captured.

---

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Coding:**  
  - Although defensive coding for the parameters `eventType` and `eventPayload` is not required, additional checks on other dynamic data (such as values from `b.lookupTable` and `b.structureLkps`) can help prevent runtime errors.
  
- **Code Duplication and Variable Reassignment:**  
  - The variable `TagParams` is declared and assigned multiple times. Refactoring to assign once and reuse would improve clarity.
  
- **Modularisation:**  
  - Consider breaking the code into smaller, self-contained functions or modules. This can enhance testability and readability.
  
- **Error Logging:**  
  - Expand error logging beyond just console logging within event listeners. This will assist in debugging issues in production.
  
- **Loop Constructs:**  
  - Replace "for…in" loops used for arrays with standard indexed loops to ensure only numeric keys are iterated over.
  
- **Maintain ES5 Compatibility:**  
  - Ensure all refactoring adheres to ES5 standards by avoiding ES6 features such as arrow functions, let/const, template literals, etc.
