# Pegasus V2 : GDC functions Extension Documentation

This document details the “Pegasus V2 : GDC functions” Tealium iQ extension. It covers an overview of the extension, a walkthrough of its internal code logic, usage examples, known limitations, recommendations for refactoring, and recommendations for maintenance.

---

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Pegasus V2 : GDC functions  
- **Extension ID:** 2096 (Advanced Javascript Code extension with an associated library id: 100040)  
- **Type:** Advanced Javascript Code (runs as a custom code extension)  
- **Scope:** 1655  
- **Execution Frequency:**  
  - This extension is executed when the relevant lookup table is processed in the Tealium load. It iterates over the lookup table array (`b.lookupTable.forEach(runLookups);`) and executes its logic against each record.  

**Summary:**  
This extension is designed to process conversion events for integration with Floodlights (via Google’s gtag function) by mapping Tealium data to the required payload. It provides functions to differentiate between types of events (e.g. purchase vs. conversion), split and unpack delimited strings, create eligibility rules, and set event triggers (immediate, timed, or event-based). The extension supports dynamic mappings between lookup table parameters and the required conversion tag parameters for accurate data reporting.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables and Global Dependencies

- **Parameters Passed In:**  
  - `a` (eventType): String representing the event type (guaranteed as a string).  
  - `b` (eventPayload): Object containing various data points (customer data, journey details, tag-related fields, etc.).  
  - `u` (tagObject): Typically an object containing details for the tag execution.  

- **Global Objects / Libraries:**  
  - `gtag`: Google’s tag reporting function.  
  - `LBGAnalytics`: Custom global object used for cookie decoding and DOM event handling.  
  - `clova3`: Object providing methods for data layer interactions and truth-checks (`clova3.Q`).  
  - `utag`: Tealium data layer object used to set and retrieve data.  
  - Additionally, the extension depends on a lookup table (`b.lookupTable`) and an object containing lookup structure (`b.structureLkps`).

### Logical Flow and Explanation of Functions

1. **gfl_report_conversion(DC_src, DC_type, DC_cat):**  
   - Differentiates between two types of events:
     - If `b.PegasusApplicationState` equals 'Fulfilled', the event is treated as a purchase.
       - Uses `b.paid_order_id` for the order id, `b.JourneyAmount` for the value, labels the conversion as "purchase" and the tag as "transactions".
     - Otherwise, a default conversion is assumed with defaults (order id set to 1, conversion type “conversion”, value 0, and tag type “unique”).
   - Generates a deduplicated `order_id` by concatenating the visitor and session ids.
   - Sets up a payload object with various custom conversion parameters (such as product details, journey data, advertiser IDs, etc.).
   - Iterates through payload string values with a simple check to remove any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) – specifically checking for the "@" character or its URL-encoded equivalent ("%40") and blanking those out.
   - Handles consent mode (via `LBGAnalytics.privacy.decodeCookie()`) to remove certain identifiers if privacy consent is not given.
   - Finally, calls the global `gtag` function with the determined conversion type and payload.

2. **unpackStr(TagValues, delim):**  
   - A helper function that splits a string based on a provided delimiter (`delim`) and returns an array.  
   - Used throughout the extension to process delimited lookup strings.

3. **createElig(arr):**  
   - Maps an eligibility array (passed in as `arr`) to an object using a lookup table (`b.structureLkps`).
   - Generates an array (`eligArr`) that contains rules in the format `lookup_field contains value`.
   - Returns a two-element array containing the eligibility rules and a trigger type extracted from the input.

4. **unpackTag(arr):**  
   - Splits an array (expected to contain tag details concatenated in a single string) into two components: input and output strings.
   - Returns an array of two strings to be further processed.

5. **findTag(currentTag):**  
   - Processes a string (`currentTag`) and splits it with the "!" delimiter.
   - Checks if the tag type is "gfl" (Google Floodlights) and returns the processed tag parameters if it matches.

6. **setTags(DC_src, DC_type, DC_cat, trigger):**  
   - Determines the method for executing `gfl_report_conversion` based on the passed `trigger`.
     - Triggered immediately if the trigger equals "Page".
     - Triggered with a delay if the trigger contains "Timed". The delay is set as the second parameter after splitting the trigger string at the colon (":").
     - Triggered on a DOM event if the trigger contains "Event". It uses jQuery-like event listeners on a specified DOM element, potentially filtering by button text if required.
   - Supports execution of the conversion function under different interaction scenarios.

7. **runLookups(currentArr):**  
   - Called for each record in the lookup table (`b.lookupTable`).
   - Unpacks the record using `unpackTag` and further processes the input data to build eligibility rules.
   - Searches within the tag IDs for a matching "gfl" tag.
   - If found and if all eligibility criteria are met (using `eligArr.every(clova3.Q)`), extracts required Floodlight parameters (DC_src, DC_type, DC_cat and optionally DC_act).
   - Sets values on the Tealium data layer and passes the Floodlight parameters and trigger to `setTags`.

8. **Code Execution:**  
   - Finally, the extension iterates over the entire lookup table (`b.lookupTable.forEach(runLookups);`), processing each record according to the functions described above.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Immediate Page Conversion  
- **Input:**  
  - A lookup record in `b.lookupTable` triggers the "Page" action.  
  - `b.PegasusApplicationState` is "Fulfilled", indicating a purchase.
- **Flow:**  
  - `runLookups` processes the lookup entry, retrieves the relevant tag parameters.
  - `createElig` builds eligibility rules which pass validation.
  - `setTags` identifies that the trigger is "Page" and invokes `gfl_report_conversion` immediately.
- **Output:**  
  - A successful call to `gtag` is made with the conversion event type "purchase" and the relevant payload is transmitted with attributes such as order id, transaction amount, etc.

### Scenario 2: Delayed (Timed) Conversion  
- **Input:**  
  - A lookup record contains a trigger like "Timed:2000" (i.e. delay trigger with 2000 milliseconds).  
- **Flow:**  
  - During processing in `setTags`, the extension identifies the "Timed" trigger.
  - It unpacks the trigger string to extract the delay time.
  - Uses `window.setTimeout` to delay the execution of `gfl_report_conversion` for the specified time.
- **Output:**  
  - The conversion event is reported after a 2000ms delay, ensuring the user is on the webpage for a minimum duration.

### Scenario 3: Event-based Conversion  
- **Input:**  
  - A lookup record that triggers on a specific DOM event is provided, for example, a click event on a given element with an optional filter on the button text.
- **Flow:**  
  - `setTags` processes the "Event" trigger and attaches an event listener to the specified DOM element.
  - When the event occurs (and if any text filter condition is fulfilled), `gfl_report_conversion` is invoked.
- **Output:**  
  - The conversion event is sent upon firing the designated event, allowing for conversion tracking based on user interactions.

### Edge Condition: Privacy Consent  
- **Input:**  
  - If `LBGAnalytics.privacy.decodeCookie().statusCode` does not return "y" or "t".
- **Flow:**  
  - The code removes certain PII values from the payload object before making the call via `gtag`.
- **Output:**  
  - Conversion is reported without sensitive information, complying with privacy requirements.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **PII Scrubbing Approach:**  
  - The method of checking for "@" or "%40" in any string value is basic. There might be edge cases where valid data could contain these substrings. Consider more robust PII detection if needed.

- **Reliance on External Libraries:**  
  - Dependencies on external global objects (`LBGAnalytics`, `clova3`, `utag`, and `gtag`) mean that if these libraries are not available or are updated, the extension may fail or behave unpredictably.

- **DOM Selection in Event Listeners:**  
  - The use of `LBGAnalytics.$` to attach event handlers depends on the proper working of this jQuery-like selector. If the DOM structure changes or if multiple elements match the selector, unexpected behaviour might occur.

- **Lookup Table Structure:**  
  - The extension assumes a specific format for lookup table entries and `b.structureLkps`. Any deviation or misconfiguration in these objects might render the mapping logic ineffective.

- **Consent Mode Specifics:**  
  - The logic to remove PII fields on lack of consent specifically targets a set of fields. Adding new fields that need to be scrubbed may require additional changes.

- **ES5 Requirement:**  
  - The code must remain ES5 compliant; as a result, it doesn’t take advantage of newer syntax or safer coding patterns available in later versions of ECMAScript.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks & Error Handling:**  
  - While basic try/catch statements are present around `gfl_report_conversion` in event listeners, consider adding more robust error logging to help diagnose issues if an exception occurs during payload generation.
  - Validate that the lookup table and lookup structure exist and are in the expected format before iterating through them.

- **Modularisation:**  
  - Although the extension is written as a single self-contained function, splitting the helper functions into separate modules (or sections) can improve readability and maintainability. For instance, grouping all string parsing/unpacking functions together.

- **Code Style and Comments:**  
  - Increase inline comments where non-trivial logic is involved (e.g. in eligibility rule creation and conversion type differentiation) to aid future maintainers.
  - Ensure consistency in variable names and spacing. For example, reusing variable names (like `TagParams` is defined twice) might lead to confusion.

- **Privacy PII Removal:**  
  - Enhance the PII scrubbing logic to check for other patterns of sensitive data and consider centralising this functionality into its own function, improving reusability and testability.

- **Global Object Dependency Isolation:**  
  - Document and, if possible, modularise or abstract the dependencies on global objects to facilitate mocking during testing. This can reduce conflicts when integrating with other Tealium extensions.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  - Maintain a version history in the source control (e.g. Git) for changes made to the extension.
  - Ensure that any updates to external libraries like `gtag`, `LBGAnalytics`, or `clova3` are tested against this extension’s logic.
  - Create unit tests for key functions such as `unpackStr`, `createElig`, and `setTags` to ensure that changes in underlying data structures do not break the extension functionality.

- **Ownership:**  
  - Assign an owner (or team) for this extension so that queries, bug fixes, and updates are channelled through the dedicated point of contact.
  - Document any dependencies or relevant changes in the project’s change log.

- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Test scenarios should include normal conversion flows, delayed and event-based triggers, and data payload verification.
  - Regularly verify that privacy consent checks are functioning as expected, and periodically review the PII removal logic to ensure it remains compliant with current data protection requirements.

- **Future Extensions:**  
  - If additional conversion types or tag integrations are needed, consider abstracting conversion logic to support multiple tag types, thereby reducing duplication of code.
