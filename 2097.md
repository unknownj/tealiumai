# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: Fudge Analytics Redux

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name**: Fudge Analytics redux
- **ID**: 2097
- **Type**: Advanced Javascript Code
- **Scope**: Before Load Rules
- **Execution Frequency**: Run Always

### Summary
The "Fudge Analytics redux" extension is designed to manipulate and populate a temporary data layer for various brands based on the user's journey through a website. Specifically, it configures values for analytics tracking in accordance with the user's current context, such as the brand, product group, and application state, thus improving the quality of data sent to the analytics system. This makes subsequent data analysis more effective by ensuring consistent and relevant context is captured across user journeys.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- **b**: Represents the data layer, which stores temporary information about the userâ€™s context.
- **LBGAnalytics**, **utag.data**: Global objects assumed to exist for analytics tracking.
- **setFudge(key, val)**: A utility function to set values in multiple data layers and manage a custom log (CustomList).

### Logic Flow
1. **Environment Setup**: The extension starts by defining the `setFudge` function used to update values in the data layer.
2. **Brand Check**: It verifies the `Brand` property and excludes any journeys involving `/gforms`.
3. **Conditional Logic**: Based on the `CanonicalPath`, `JourneyName`, and other parameters, different values are set in the data layer:
   - Brand-specific variables are cleared or set.
   - Based on the journey being traversed (insurance, loans, etc.), specific values for `PegasusBrand`, `PegasusProductGroup`, `PegasusPageRole`, and `PegasusApplicationState` are assigned.
4. **Application State Handling**: Depending on specific conditions in the journey, the state of the application is set, impacting what data is logged for that session.

### Dependencies
- **Global Objects**: Utilises `LBGAnalytics` and `utag.data`, which are not defined within the extension. They are expected to be part of the broader Tealium setup.
- **Data Layer Structure**: Assumes a specific structure is followed within the `b` object.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Flow
- **Scenario**: A user visits a /life-cover page under LLOYDS brand.
  - The variables `PegasusBrand`, `PegasusProductGroup`, and `PegasusPageRole` are set accordingly to reflect that the user is in the insurance product group and is likely browsing.

### Edge Conditions
- **Scenario**: A user is on a page that does not fit any specified condition (e.g., an unexpected URL structure).
  - The code may not set any values, maintaining the existing state, which may lead to incomplete data being sent.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Performance**: Extensive checks on the data layer can lead to slower performance if there are too many conditions or if the data layer is complex.
- **Potential Overwrites**: If the same `key` is set in multiple conditions without proper handling, previous values may be overwritten unintentionally.
- **Broken Paths**: If a supported journey path is changed or a new structure is implemented, adjustments to the conditions may be required.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Modularisation**: Break out related functions and conditions into smaller, reusable functions to improve readability and maintainability.
- **Code Style Improvements**: While ES5 is required, maintaining consistent formatting (e.g., consistent use of curly braces and indentation) will increase legibility.
- **Defensive Checks**: Given that `setFudge` is a key function, consider adding checks to ensure the provided key and value conform to expected types.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ownership**: Assign a dedicated team member to be responsible for the extension.
- **Testing Guidelines**:
  - Continuous testing against various journey types to ensure all edge cases are handled.
  - Implement unit tests around critical functions (e.g., `setFudge`) where possible.
- **Documentation Updates**: Regularly update this documentation when changes are made to the code to ensure all stakeholders have current information.

By following these guidelines, the integrity and effectiveness of the "Fudge Analytics redux" extension can be maintained, leading to enhanced data quality and insights from analytics.
