# Fudge Analytics redux Extension Documentation

This document provides an in‐depth explanation of the extension’s configuration, code logic, usage scenarios, limitations, and recommendations for further refactoring and maintenance.

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name**: Fudge Analytics redux  
- **ID**: 2097 (Extension ID: 100040)  
- **Type**: Advanced Javascript Code  
- **Scope**: Before Load Rules  
- **Execution Frequency**: Run Always

**Summary:**  
This extension is designed to perform extensive data layer "fudges" – temporary adjustments to data values – in order to support Pegasus lookups. It harmonises the values across multiple data layers (such as the primary data layer, `utag.data`, custom analytics libraries like `LBGAnalytics.datalayer` and others) and conditions these values based on brands, canonical URLs, domains, journey steps, and other page attributes. The extension also logs custom strings to a `CustomList` property whenever a value is set (and not reset), thereby creating a traceable tag for debugging or analysis purposes.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables and Functions

- **Global References**:  
  - `eventType` and `eventPayload`: Guaranteed to be available and mapped to parameters `a` and `b`, respectively.  
  - `b`: Represents the event data object (data layer object) containing various page, journey and brand properties.  
  - `utag`: The Tealium universal tag object, where `utag.data` is used to store data layer values.  
  - `LBGAnalytics`: An external analytics object with a nested `datalayer` method to set values.  
  - `clova3`: Referenced when processing certain journey values (for example, the savings journey). Assumes that this global exists and has proper methods.

- **Function: setFudge(key, val)**  
  - Purpose: Sets a given key to the provided value across multiple data layer representations (`b`, `LBGAnalytics.datalayer`, `utag.data`), while concatenating the change to a `CustomList` property for traceability.  
  - The function wraps its operations in a try-catch block to ensure that any error in setting these values does not break the extension execution.

### Logic Flow

1. **Initial Setup & Fudge Reset**:  
   - On initial execution, the extension clears down existing Pegasus-related variables if the brand (e.g., LLOYDS, HALIFAX, BOS, IWEB, MBNA) matches and the canonical path does not include `/gforms`.

2. **Setting Brand-Specific Values**:  
   - Depending on the brand (e.g., Lloyds, Halifax, MBNA, Scottish Widows), the code sets the `PegasusBrand` value with variations (e.g. appending a division for Commercial).

3. **Journey-Specific Processing**:  
   - The extension examines properties like `CanonicalPath`, `JourneyName`, `JourneyStep`, `JourneyStepName`, and `JourneyProduct` to set values for:
     - `PegasusPageRole` (e.g. Homepage, Sales, Landing Page, Brochureware)
     - `PegasusProductGroup` (e.g. Insurance, Mortgages, Loans, Savings)
     - `PegasusApplicationState` (e.g. Product Information, Application, Offered, Fulfilled, Pre-Application)
   - Special cases are handled based on journey names like "Mortgage Calculator", "ApplyBTMT", "ApplySavings", "BuyTravelMoney", "ApplyPCA", "ApplyCarFinance", and several Domus/Mortgages-related names.
  
4. **Canonical Path, URL and Domain Based Logic**:  
   - Multiple conditional checks are executed on the `CanonicalPath`, `CanonicalURL`, and `CanonicalDomain` to determine appropriate lookups.  
   - For example:
     - Pages related to ready-made pensions, investing, estate management, or credit card specific pages get unique settings.
     - MBNA related logic handles loans, credit cards and special savings scenarios.
     - Commercial rules force certain URLs or domains (e.g. `/business`, `cardnet`) to adopt "Commercial" division settings.
     - Lastly, additional settings are applied for domains related to Scottish Widows that include particular checks for the "take-my-pension" domain.

5. **Setting Additional Properties**:  
   - The extension also sets additional values such as `Division`, `AddOns`, or custom adjustments when the canonical domain matches specific patterns, for example, differentiating between Insurance & Wealth or Commercial divisions.  

### Dependencies on Global Objects or Libraries

- **utag.data**: Data is synchronised to the Tealium data object.
- **LBGAnalytics.datalayer**: Used to set data and push values for analytics (ensure this is loaded on pages using this extension).
- **clova3.datalayer**: Specifically used in a savings journey condition.
- Assumes that standard browser methods (e.g. String.prototype.indexOf, regex `.test` and `.toUpperCase`) are available.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Example 1: Normal Page with Brand Lloyds

- Data layer property:  
  - b.Brand = "Lloyds", b.Division = "Commercial", b.CanonicalPath does not contain `/gforms`
- Execution:  
  - The extension clears any pre-existing Pegasus variables.
  - It sets `PegasusBrand` to "Lloyds Commercial".
  - If the journey is mortgage or savings related, additional values (like `PegasusPageRole` or `PegasusProductGroup`) are overwritten based on further steps.

### Example 2: Savings Journey with MBNA

- Data layer property:  
  - b.Brand = "MBNA"
  - b.CanonicalPath contains `snco` and `/cwa/`
  - b.JourneyStepName might be "Complete" or undefined.
- Execution:  
  - The extension sets `PegasusProductGroup` to "Savings".
  - If `JourneyStepName` is defined and equals "Complete", `PegasusApplicationState` is set to "Fulfilled".
  - Otherwise, default values for application state may be set when `ApplicationState` is not defined.

### Example 3: Edge Condition for Scottish Widows

- Data layer property:  
  - b.Brand includes "scottishwidows" (lowercase permitted) and b.CanonicalDomain contains "scottishwidows".
- Execution:
  - The extension forces `PegasusBrand` to "Scottish Widows" regardless of the original casing.
  - Additional page role assignments may occur if the canonical path is "/" and domain is a specific future self domain.
  - For journeys such as "Digital Encashment", the sales role is applied and further application state values are set based on the JourneyStepName.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Broad Try-Catch**:  
  - The `setFudge` function uses a try-catch without logging errors, which could swallow issues in cases where one of the external libraries is not loaded or behaves unexpectedly.
  
- **Dependency on External Globals**:  
  - The extension assumes that `LBGAnalytics`, `clova3`, and `utag` objects exist. If any of these are missing or delayed in loading, data layer updates may silently fail.
  
- **Complex Conditional Logic**:  
  - The extensive if-else structures and loops make tracking the exact transformation of a given data value challenging. Changes in one condition might have unintended side effects in others.
  
- **Hard-Coded String Comparisons**:  
  - Many operations rely on substring searches and strict matching (e.g. `"ApplyBTMT"`, `"/gforms"`). Changes to naming conventions or new journey names might require frequent code modifications.
  
- **Potential Conflicts with Other Extensions**:  
  - Since this extension runs "Before Load Rules" and sets several data layer properties, there is a risk of conflicts if other extensions modify the same properties post-execution.
  
- **Logging to Console**:  
  - The code uses console logging in production conditions (e.g. `console.log("url contains the string "+checkSales[i])`). This output may be unwanted in a live production environment.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Modularisation**:  
  - Consider breaking out the journey logic, canonical URL checks, and domain rules into smaller, focused functions. This would improve readability and maintainability.
  
- **Defensive Coding Enhancements**:  
  - Although eventType and eventPayload are guaranteed, similar checks could be applied to dependent globals (e.g. check if `LBGAnalytics` exists before using it).
  - Instead of solely relying on try-catch, consider checking for object existence before accessing nested methods.
  
- **Remove or Condition Console Logging**:  
  - Replace calls to `console.log` with a conditional debug flag or remove them entirely for production environments.
  
- **Code Comments & Documentation Inline**:  
  - Adding inline comments to each major conditional block would assist future developers in understanding the purpose behind each data layer transformation.
  
- **Consistent String Matching**:  
  - Where possible, consolidate hard-coded string checks into a configuration object or constant definitions at the top of the extension. This practice can significantly reduce errors when updating naming conventions.
  
- **ES5 Compliance**:  
  - Continue using ES5 standards (no arrow functions, let/const, or template literals) per project requirements. Ensure future tools preserve this compatibility.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ownership and Testing**:  
  - It is recommended that a designated team or individual is responsible for the upkeep of this extension. Changes in digital analytics, navigation flows, or branding require regular reviews of the conditions.
  - Automated testing or logging mechanisms could be implemented to monitor if data layer modifications occur as expected on various pages.
  
- **Version Control and Change Log**:  
  - Maintain a version history of changes and document the contexts in which modifications are made. Each change should be accompanied by a brief rationale to ease origin tracing.
  
- **Regular Reviews**:  
  - As external libraries (such as LBGAnalytics or Tealium itself) evolve, ensure that the integration points still work as expected.
  - Review the extension’s impact with QA teams periodically and during any major brand or journey updates.
  
- **Stakeholder Communication**:  
  - Ensure changes are documented for both technical teams and non-technical stakeholders who rely on the consistency of analytics data. Clear communication will help avoid misinterpretations when the lookups or transformations change.
