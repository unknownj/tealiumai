# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation

## 1. Extension Overview
- **Name**: EventStream : Disable some events redux
- **ID**: 2098
- **Type**: Advanced Javascript Code
- **Scope**: 1459
- **Execution Frequency**: On every event triggering in production

### Summary
This extension is designed to disable certain events from being sent to Tealium's EventStream in a production environment. The primary objective is to prevent unnecessary data processing for specific interactions, thereby saving event resources. This is particularly relevant for events like `journey_interaction`, which, based on certain conditions, may not be relevant in production (like when the `PegasusTagName` indicates specific servicing actions).

---

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- `a`, `b`, `u`: These are the parameters passed into the anonymous function representing:
  - `a`: Generally represents the event type (not used directly in the function).
  - `b`: The object containing the event payload data.
  - `u`: An unused variable placeholder (potentially for future use).

### Logic Flow
The logic proceeds as follows:
1. It first checks if the environment is production (`b["ut.env"] === "prod"`) and excludes events that contain "App Complete" in `PegasusTagName`.
2. Subsequently, it verifies if:
   - The `JourneyEvent` is undefined or does not contain "load".
   - The current event is a `journey_interaction`. If both conditions are met, the function returns `false`, preventing the event from being processed.
3. Additional checks ensure that if the event is a `journey_interaction` and the `PegasusTagName` indicates various servicing tasks, it also returns `false` to disable processing.

### Dependencies
- The extension relies on several global objects:
  - `b` (event payload) containing keys like `ut.env`, `JourneyEvent`, `tealium_event`, and `PegasusTagName`.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Example 1: Normal Condition
- **Scenario**: A `journey_interaction` event is triggered in production with `PegasusTagName` not related to servicing.
  - **Input**: 
    ```javascript
    eventPayload = {
      "ut.env": "prod",
      "JourneyEvent": "load",
      "tealium_event": "journey_interaction",
      "PegasusTagName": "Some | Relevant Data"
    };
    ```
  - **Output**: Event is processed as normal.

### Example 2: Edge Condition - Ignored Event
- **Scenario**: A `journey_interaction` event is triggered in production with a `PegasusTagName` linked to servicing.
  - **Input**:
    ```javascript
    eventPayload = {
      "ut.env": "prod",
      "JourneyEvent": "interaction",
      "tealium_event": "journey_interaction",
      "PegasusTagName": "NA | Servicing"
    };
    ```
  - **Output**: Event is not processed; function returns `false`.

### Example 3: Lack of `JourneyEvent`
- **Scenario**: A `journey_interaction` event is triggered, but `JourneyEvent` is not defined.
  - **Input**:
    ```javascript
    eventPayload = {
      "ut.env": "prod",
      "tealium_event": "journey_interaction",
      "PegasusTagName": "Some | Data"
    };
    ```
  - **Output**: Event is ignored, and function returns `false`.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas
- The extension is explicitly configured for the production environment. It does not handle cases for development or staging environments, which might lead to events being unintentionally suppressed in those settings.
- Conflicts may arise with other extensions or ETL processes that also manipulate `tealium_event` values, particularly if they expect `journey_interaction` events to always be processed.

---

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring
- **Modularisation**: Consider breaking down this logic into smaller functions to enhance readability and maintainability.
- **Comments**: Add more inline comments to clarify the purpose of key conditionals and variables, improving future comprehensibility.
- **Defensive Checks**: While we are not required to ensure the presence of `eventType` and `eventPayload`, it is good practice to validate assumptions such as the types and expected structure of `b`.
- **Consistency**: Adhere to a consistent style guide for variable naming conventions and spacing to ensure readability.

---

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes
- **Ownership**: Assign a responsible party for ongoing updates, especially when event handling logic changes.
- **Testing Guidelines**: Implement a suite of tests to validate functionality under various scenarios, especially for edge cases detailed in the usage examples.
- **Documentation Updates**: Regularly review and update this documentation as the extension logic evolves to keep it relevant and helpful for stakeholders and developers.
