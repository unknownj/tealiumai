# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name**: EventStream : Disable some events redux
- **ID**: 2098
- **Type**: Advanced JavaScript Code
- **Scope**: 1459
- **Execution Frequency**: On every event triggered

### Summary

This extension is designed to conditionally disable certain `journey_interaction` events in the production environment. The main goal is to conserve event logging by preventing the firing of unneeded events related to servicing tags under specific conditions. This helps optimize event tracking and resource utilization in the production system.

---

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables

- **a, b, u**: Parameters of the immediate function representing:
  - `a`: Event type (not explicitly used in the code)
  - `b`: Payload containing event data (includes properties like `tealium_event` and `PegasusTagName`)
  - `u`: Unused in this context, could typically represent a URL or other utility.

### Logic Flow

1. **Environment Check**: 
   - The first conditional checks if the current environment (`ut.env`) is set to "prod".
   - It also ensures that the event is not of type "App Complete" by checking `PegasusTagName`.

2. **Event Filtering**:
   - For `journey_interaction` events:
     - If the `JourneyEvent` is either undefined or does not contain "load", the event is blocked.
     - A series of additional checks disable events tagged with specific servicing strings.
  
### Dependencies

- **Global Objects**:
  - `b["ut.env"]`: Checks the environment status.
  - `b["JourneyEvent"]`: Used to identify specific event types in the payload.
  - `b.tealium_event`: Defines the type of event being processed.
  - `b.PegasusTagName`: Provides context on the source of the event.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Standard Scenario

In a typical production environment where the `tealium_event` is "journey_interaction" and `PegasusTagName` is not part of the disabled strings:
- **Input**: `{"ut.env": "prod", "tealium_event": "journey_interaction", "JourneyEvent": "load", "PegasusTagName": "Other Tag"}`
- **Output**: Event is processed as normal.

### Edge Conditions

1. **Event Blocked**:
   - **Input**: `{"ut.env": "prod", "tealium_event": "journey_interaction", "JourneyEvent": "not a load", "PegasusTagName": "Service | Sales"}`
   - **Output**: Event is blocked due to matching blocked conditions.

2. **Non-Production Environment**:
   - **Input**: `{"ut.env": "dev", "tealium_event": "journey_interaction", "PegasusTagName": "Service | Sales"}`
   - **Output**: Event is processed as normal, as the environment is not "prod".

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Production Environment Dependency**: The effectiveness of the extension is limited to specific environments. If inadvertently deployed in non-production settings, it may lead to unexpected behaviour.
- **PegasusTagName Variability**: This extension heavily depends on the consistency of the `PegasusTagName` values. If new tags are introduced or existing tags are modified, the logic may need to be updated accordingly.
- **Debugging Difficulty**: Since events are silently dropped based on the conditions, it can be challenging to debug missing events without extensive logging.

---

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Modularisation**: Consider splitting the logic into smaller functions to clarify the purpose of each conditional check. For example, functions can be made for checking the environment and specific tag names.
  
- **Enhanced Logging**: Incorporating logging would allow easier debugging of why certain events are blocked. You might want to log whenever an event is dropped to audit how many events are affected by this extension.
  
- **Defensive Checks**: Ensure robust handling of edge cases, such as when properties like `PegasusTagName` may not be defined to avoid potential errors when accessing these properties.
  
- **In-Code Documentation**: Adding inline comments within the code can help make the purpose of each block clearer to future maintainers.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ownership**: Ensure a dedicated owner is responsible for maintaining this extension. They should have a clear understanding of the business logic behind event tracking requirements.
  
- **Testing Guidelines**: Establish a process for testing the extension during every major release cycle. Check both production and development environments for consistent behaviour in event tracking.

- **Regular Reviews**: Schedule periodic reviews of the extension to ensure its relevance, effectiveness, and compatibility with other Tealium extensions or changes in event tracking strategy.

This documentation should help any developer or stakeholder understand the purpose and functionality of the `EventStream: Disable some events redux` Tealium iQ extension thoroughly.
