# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** EventStream : Disable some events redux  
- **Extension ID:** 2098  
- **Type:** Advanced Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** 1459  
- **Execution Frequency:**  
  - The code is executed each time an event passes through the Tealium tag management process for the relevant scope. It uses synchronous processing to evaluate conditions and potentially abort event propagation.

**Summary:**  
The extension’s purpose is to selectively disable the propagation of certain events ("journey_interaction") based on specific conditions. In a production (prod) environment, the extension targets events that do not relate to "App Complete", and further filters out various servicing-related events. This is done to save on event volumes by preventing undesirable events from being sent forward to EventStream and other consumers.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables:
- **a:** Represents the event type (passed in as the first parameter).  
- **b:** Represents the event data (payload object) which contains properties such as "ut.env", "PegasusTagName", "tealium_event", and "JourneyEvent".  
- **u:** Represents the tag object (passed as the third parameter), though it is not actively used within the extension code.

### Global Variables and Dependencies:
- The code assumes the availability and correctness of global objects:  
  - `eventType` (string)  
  - `eventPayload` (object)  
  - `tagObject` (object)  
- There is an expectation that certain properties exist on the event payload:  
  - `ut.env` is used to identify the environment (e.g. "prod").  
  - `PegasusTagName` is used to determine the type of event being processed.  
  - `tealium_event` indicates the type of event, specifically targeting "journey_interaction" events.  
  - `JourneyEvent` (if defined) is evaluated to see if its lower-case representation contains the string "load".

### Logic Flow:
1. **Environment and Tag Filtering**  
   The primary condition checks if the environment is production (`ut.env` equals `"prod"`) and that `PegasusTagName` does not include the string `"App Complete"`.
   
2. **Journey Event Handling**  
   - If the event is of the type "journey_interaction" and either the `JourneyEvent` property is undefined or does not contain the substring `"load"`, the code returns `false`. This indicates that the event should be blocked.
   - Additional conditions are applied when the event is "journey_interaction":
     - If `PegasusTagName` contains `"NA | Servicing"`
     - If `PegasusTagName` contains `"Service | Sales"`
     - If `PegasusTagName` contains `"Service | Servicing"`
     - If `PegasusTagName` contains `"Service | NA"`
     
   In all these servicing conditions, the event is similarly blocked (by returning `false`).

3. **Early Exit Mechanism:**  
   The use of `return false;` in these checks effectively prevents further processing of the event, stopping it from being forwarded.

### Dependencies and External Interfaces:
- The extension is dependent on properties within the `eventPayload` being set up correctly by Tealium iQ.
- There is an inherent expectation that string methods like `indexOf` and `toLowerCase` are available and behave as standard in ES5.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Normal Production Environment Filtering
- **Input:**  
  - `ut.env`: `"prod"`  
  - `PegasusTagName`: `"Some Tag Info, not App Complete"`  
  - `tealium_event`: `"journey_interaction"`  
  - `JourneyEvent`: `"initial load"`  
- **Process:**  
  Since the environment is production, the code checks if `PegasusTagName` includes `"App Complete"` (it does not) and then evaluates `JourneyEvent`. As `JourneyEvent` contains `"load"`, this event passes the first conditional check and is not blocked by that clause.
- **Edge Conditions:**  
  - If the event’s `PegasusTagName` had included one of the servicing strings, it would be blocked.
  
### Scenario 2: Blocked Event Due to Non-Load JourneyEvent
- **Input:**  
  - `ut.env`: `"prod"`  
  - `PegasusTagName`: `"Regular Tag Data"`  
  - `tealium_event`: `"journey_interaction"`  
  - `JourneyEvent`: `"user click"`  (does not include `"load"`)
- **Process:**  
  The condition in the `if` block will return false as `JourneyEvent` does not include `"load"` (ignoring case), thereby stopping this event.

### Scenario 3: Blocked Servicing Event
- **Input:**  
  - `ut.env`: `"prod"`  
  - `PegasusTagName`: `"Service | Sales - information"`  
  - `tealium_event`: `"journey_interaction"`
- **Process:**  
  The servicing condition is met due to `"Service | Sales"` being a substring within `PegasusTagName`. The event is blocked with `return false;`.

### Scenario 4: Non-Production Environment
- **Input:**  
  - `ut.env`: `"dev"`  
  - Any values for `PegasusTagName` or `tealium_event`.
- **Process:**  
  Since the environment is not production, none of the internal conditions are triggered, and the code does not block any events. The event flows through as normal even if it matches any of the journey or servicing conditions.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Environment Dependency:**  
  The logic is strictly activated only in a production environment (`ut.env === "prod"`). Testing in other environments may not reflect production behaviour.

- **String Matching Reliant on indexOf:**  
  The checks use `indexOf`, which is simple substring matching and may lead to false positives or negatives if the naming convention of `PegasusTagName` is inconsistent or unexpectedly modified.

- **Specificity of Service Handling:**  
  The extension explicitly blocks a limited set of servicing event patterns. Should there be changes to these servicing event names, the extension must be updated accordingly.

- **No Fallback or Logging:**  
  There is no logging mechanism to indicate why an event might have been blocked, making debugging more difficult, especially in production environments.

- **Potential Conflicts:**  
  If other Tealium extensions are altering or evaluating similar properties (e.g. `tealium_event` or `PegasusTagName`), there might be conflicts in the event-processing pipeline.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks on Properties:**  
  While it is guaranteed that `eventType` and `eventPayload` are present, consider adding checks for the presence of critical properties such as `ut.env`, `PegasusTagName`, or `tealium_event` if the extension is to be used in a broader scope.

- **Code Readability:**  
  - Consider encapsulating repetitive checks (e.g. servicing conditions) into a helper function to enable easier maintenance.
  - Use clear comments on each logic segment for easier understanding and future modifications.

- **Modularisation:**  
  If future requirements expand the extension or add more conditions, look at breaking out logic into distinct functions within the constraints of ES5 practices (i.e. using function declarations instead of arrow functions).

- **Error Handling:**  
  Implement a rudimentary logging mechanism to capture reason codes or messages when an event is blocked. This logging can be driven by external logging systems that align with Tealium’s best practises.

- **Documentation Updates:**  
  Ensure that any changes to event filtering logic are documented and communicated to stakeholders, so that the reasoning behind blocked events remains transparent.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Regularly simulate both production-like and non-production event payloads to verify that events are being blocked or allowed as expected.
  - Integration tests should incorporate sample events with variations of `PegasusTagName` and `JourneyEvent` to ensure all conditions are tested.

- **Ownership:**  
  - Assign an owner or team responsible for updating the extension when new event types or servicing conditions arise.
  - Maintain version control on the extension code and ensure changes are documented in release notes.

- **Future Enhancements:**  
  - Evaluate the need for more dynamic configuration (e.g. externally managed filters) to avoid frequent code changes.
  - Consider collaborating with data analysts or marketing teams if event filtering logic must be revisited based on campaign performance.

- **Documentation:**  
  Keep this documentation up-to-date with any code changes and communicate with stakeholders regarding the logic and any potential impacts on data collection.
