# NGA Webchat Integration Load Rule

This documentation provides an overview and detailed explanation of the NGA Webchat Integration Load Rule extension, including its code logic, usage scenarios, known limitations, refactoring recommendations and maintenance notes.

---

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** NGA Webchat Integration Load Rule  
- **ID:** 2100 (Internal), Extension ID: 100036  
- **Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** Before Load Rules  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Always  

**Summary:**  
This extension evaluates specific runtime conditions to determine whether the NGA Webchat integration should be enabled. It uses a series of load conditions to check the current URL and global objects (such as JSBridge) before testing various overrides from query strings, app version checks, and feature flags. When applicable, it sets a global override (`b.WebchatPlatformOverride = "NGA"`) to ensure that the NGA platform webchat is activated.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables and Global Dependencies

- **Global Objects:**
  - `LBGAnalytics`: Used for logging and maintaining feature flags.
  - `JSBridge`: Checks for the existence of chat integration methods.
  - `window.location`: Used to retrieve query string parameters.
  - `b`: Alias for event payload or globally passed object containing properties like `AppVersion`.

- **Key Variables:**
  - `LBGAnalytics.featureFlags`: An object which stores feature flags, ensuring defaults if not already set.
  - `loadConditions`: An array of arrays where each sub-array represents a set of load conditions. Each condition is a string representing a check (e.g. "pathname contains /personal-loan-auth/") or an array of conditions to be met concurrently.
  - `b.Q(loadConditions)`: A function call (presumably part of the supplied library) that evaluates the load conditions. The result is assigned to `LBGAnalytics.featureFlags.ngaWebchat` and determines whether or not the extension should continue.

### Logic Flow

1. **Initial Setup & Condition Evaluation:**
   - The code begins by setting up the `LBGAnalytics.featureFlags` object.
   - It defines an array (`loadConditions`) containing condition sets. The conditions check:
     - Whether the URL pathname contains segments such as `/personal-loan-auth/` or `/ccc/`.
     - The existence of the `JSBridge` object.
     - In some cases, the specific hostname prefixes (e.g. `sit0`, `put0`, etc.) are also checked.
   - The load conditions are evaluated using the function `b.Q(loadConditions)`. If the evaluation returns false (i.e. not meeting the conditions), the script returns early, disabling the extension.

2. **JSBridge and Feature Flag Checks:**
   - If the load conditions pass, the code enters a `try...catch` block to safely execute the integration logic.
   - It first verifies if the method `updateNgaValue` exists on the `JSBridge` object.
   - Logging statements (using `LBGAnalytics.analyticsLog`) help trace which conditions are met.

3. **Override Checks:**
   - **Query String Override:**  
     If the URL query string includes "ngawebchat=enabled", it logs the event and sets `b.WebchatPlatformOverride` to "NGA".
   - **Android App Version:**  
     If `b.AppVersion` is defined as a string and starts with "an147.00" (checked in a case-insensitive manner), it logs the event accordingly.
   - **iOS App Version:**  
     For iOS devices, the code extracts the version number (after "ip") and compares it against a minimum version of 148.03.
   - **JSBridge Version Checks:**  
     Two additional checks are performed:
     - If `JSBridge.version()` (converted to a string) contains "v2".
     - If `JSBridge.version()` contains "v1.9".
   - **Feature Flag Override:**  
     Finally, if none of the above conditions apply but a feature flag `LBGAnalytics.featureFlags.ngaWebchatOverride` is set, the override is applied.
   - If none of these conditions are met, the extension logs that NGA Webchat is "Not enabled" and does not alter `b.WebchatPlatformOverride`.

4. **Exception Handling:**
   - Any errors encountered during execution are caught, and an error log is written via `LBGAnalytics.analyticsLog`.

### Dependencies

- The extension depends on:
  - A global `LBGAnalytics` object for logging and feature flag management.
  - A global `JSBridge` object for checking function availability and versioning.
  - The custom function `b.Q()` to evaluate the defined load conditions.
  - The global `b` object, which is assumed to always contain properties like `AppVersion`.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Query String Override
- **Input:**  
  The page URL contains the query string parameter `ngawebchat=enabled`.
- **Process:**  
  The load conditions pass (e.g. URL contains `/personal-loan-auth/` or `/ccc/`), the `JSBridge` is detected and its methods are available.
- **Outcome:**  
  The extension logs "NGAWC: Enabled by querystring" and sets `b.WebchatPlatformOverride` to `"NGA"`.

---

### Scenario 2: Android App Version Check
- **Input:**  
  The `AppVersion` property of the `b` object is a string and starts with "an147.00".
- **Process:**  
  After the load conditions and availability of `JSBridge.updateNgaValue` are confirmed, the app version check triggers.
- **Outcome:**  
  The extension logs "NGAWC: Enabled for an147" and enables the override by setting `b.WebchatPlatformOverride` to `"NGA"`.

---

### Scenario 3: iOS App Version Check
- **Input:**  
  The `AppVersion` is set to a string starting with "ip" followed by version numbers where the numerical interpretation is >= 148.03 (e.g. "ip148.03.1").
- **Process:**  
  The JSBridge is available, load conditions pass and the code parses the version number.
- **Outcome:**  
  The extension logs "NGAWC: Enabled for ip148.03+" and sets the override accordingly.

---

### Scenario 4: No Conditions Met
- **Input:**  
  None of the override conditions are met (no query string, incorrect app version, and JSBridge versions do not contain "v2" or "v1.9").
- **Process:**  
  The load conditions may still pass, but none of the further criteria are met.
- **Outcome:**  
  The extension logs "NGAWC: Not enabled" and no override is applied.

---

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **JSBridge Dependency:**  
  The extension requires the `JSBridge` object and its methods (`updateNgaValue` and `version`). If the JSBridge is not loaded or has a different implementation, the extension will exit without enabling the webchat.
  
- **Global Object Dependencies:**  
  The extension assumes the presence of `LBGAnalytics` and its methods (`analyticsLog`, and the featureFlags object). Conflicts or modifications to these objects by other extensions or scripts could cause unexpected behaviour.

- **Load Conditions Evaluation:**  
  The custom function `b.Q()` handles the load conditions. An incorrect or unexpected response from this evaluation may lead to the entire logic not running.

- **Hardcoded Checks:**  
  Specific version checks and URL path conditions are hardcoded. If the underlying journeys or app versioning change, the extension may need to be updated.

- **ES5 Compatibility:**  
  The code is written for ES5 compatibility. Certain modern best practices for error handling or module organisation are not adopted, which could lead to maintenance challenges.

---

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Modularisation:**  
  Consider breaking the code into smaller functions to isolate:
  - Condition evaluation (possibly abstracting the load conditionsâ€™ evaluation away from business logic).
  - Override selection (each override condition can be a separate function).

- **Defensive Logging & Error Handling:**  
  While errors are caught by a try/catch block, additional context could be logged (e.g. the specific value of `b.AppVersion` or the result of `b.Q(loadConditions)`) to aid debugging.

- **Improve Readability:**  
  Replace chained else-if statements with clearly named functions that describe each override condition. This would improve maintainability, even under ES5 constraints.

- **Configuration Externalisation:**  
  If possible, move hardcoded values (e.g. version strings, URL fragments) to configuration variables at the top of the script. This approach minimises magic numbers or strings and improves future customisation.

- **Consistency in Comments:**  
  Enhance inline comments to further describe why each condition exists, particularly for version checks.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Testing:**  
  Regularly test the extension in all supported environments (SIT, PUT, LUAT, live) to ensure that changes in URLs, app versions, or the JSBridge implementation do not break the integration.

- **Ownership & Version Control:**  
  Maintain clear version control of the extension. Tag changes in the versioning system (e.g. Git) along with dates and rationale for modifications.

- **Cross-Dependency Checks:**  
  Document any dependencies (like the expected API of JSBridge and LBGAnalytics) and ensure that updates to these libraries are coordinated with changes to the extension.

- **Documentation Updates:**  
  Ensure that this documentation is updated alongside any changes to the code. A changelog section may be useful to summarise modifications over time.

- **Regression Testing:**  
  When refactoring, incorporate regression tests that simulate various client environments using query strings, different app versions, and varying conditions of the JSBridge object.
