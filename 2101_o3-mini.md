# CanonicalURL fix redux Extension Documentation

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** CanonicalURL fix redux  
- **ID:** 2101 (Internal Extension ID: 100040)  
- **Type:** Advanced Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** Before Load Rules  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Always  

### Summary

This extension is designed to consolidate and standardise the creation of the "CanonicalURL" across the site. It achieves this by concatenating two values—`CanonicalDomainProd` and `CanonicalPath`—found in the event payload. The resulting URL is then set across multiple data layers (Tealium’s data object, LBGAnalytics and clova3 data layers) to ensure consistency in how the canonical URL is referenced, regardless of the context in which it is accessed.

## 2. Code Explanation

Below is a detailed walkthrough of the JavaScript code used in the extension:

### Key Variables & Inputs

- **Parameters:**  
  - `a` (eventType): Although passed in, it is not used within our logic.  
  - `b` (eventPayload): This object is expected to contain keys `CanonicalDomainProd` and `CanonicalPath`.

- **Variables Created:**  
  - `c`: An array constructed from `b['CanonicalDomainProd']` and `b['CanonicalPath']`.  
    - Note: `c` is assigned without using `var`, meaning it would be declared as a global variable in ES5. This is one aspect that could be improved.

### Logic Flow

1. **Concatenation:**  
   - The extension creates an array `c` containing two elements from the event payload:
     - `b['CanonicalDomainProd']`: Represents the canonical domain (e.g. "https://www.example.com")
     - `b['CanonicalPath']`: Represents the canonical path (e.g. "/page")
   - These two values are concatenated using the `join('')` method, producing the complete canonical URL (e.g. "https://www.example.com/page").

2. **Setting the CanonicalURL:**
   - The calculated URL is stored in three locations:
     - Directly on the event payload: `b['CanonicalURL']`
     - In Tealium’s data layer: `utag.data["CanonicalURL"]`
     - On two external objects for analytics:  
       - `LBGAnalytics.datalayer.set("CanonicalURL",  c.join(''), true);`
       - `clova3.datalayer.set("CanonicalURL",  c.join(''), true);`

### Dependencies

- **Global Objects:**  
  - `utag`: Tealium’s main tag object (specifically `utag.data` is used).
  - `LBGAnalytics` and `clova3`: Presumed global objects with a `datalayer.set` method. These indicate integration with external analytics systems.
  
- **Assumptions:**  
  - The script implies these global objects and their methods are pre-defined and available when this extension runs.
  - The event payload (`b`) is guaranteed to have the necessary properties (`CanonicalDomainProd` and `CanonicalPath`).

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Scenario

- **Input Event Payload:**

  {
    CanonicalDomainProd: "https://www.example.com",
    CanonicalPath: "/home"
  }

- **Processing:**  
  - The extension extracts the two values, concatenates them to form "https://www.example.com/home".
  - The canonical URL is then assigned to:
    - `b['CanonicalURL']`  
    - `utag.data["CanonicalURL"]`  
    - `LBGAnalytics.datalayer` and `clova3.datalayer` via their `set` functions.

- **Outcome:**  
  The canonical URL is uniformly updated across all required data sources for a consistent reference.

### Edge Scenario

- **Missing or Empty Values:**  

  Suppose the event payload is:
  
  {
    CanonicalDomainProd: "",
    CanonicalPath: "/contact"
  }
  
  OR
  
  {
    CanonicalDomainProd: "https://www.example.com",
    CanonicalPath: ""
  }

- **Processing:**  
  - The join operation (`c.join('')`) would still execute, but the resulting URL may be incomplete or simply equal to the non-empty value (e.g. "/contact" or "https://www.example.com").

- **Outcome:**  
  An incomplete or unexpected canonical URL could be generated if either part is empty. Care should be taken upstream to ensure valid values are supplied.

---

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Global Variable Declaration:**  
  - The variable `c` is not declared using `var`, hence it becomes global. This may lead to accidental overwrites in larger projects or conflict if another global `c` exists.
  
- **Dependency on External Objects:**  
  - The extension assumes that `utag`, `LBGAnalytics`, and `clova3` are available in the global scope at runtime. If any of these objects are not defined, the code will throw errors.
  
- **Data Integrity:**  
  - No checks are performed to ensure that `b['CanonicalDomainProd']` and `b['CanonicalPath']` contain valid strings. If either is missing or invalid, the concatenation could result in an incorrect URL.
  
- **Potential Conflicts:**  
  - Ensure that no other Tealium iQ extension or external script attempts to modify the same data keys (e.g. "CanonicalURL") in a way that conflicts or overwrites the intended values.

---

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Variable Declaration:**  
  - Introduce strict variable declaration (using `var`) for the array `c` to avoid polluting the global scope.
    Example:  
    var c = [b['CanonicalDomainProd'], b['CanonicalPath']];
  
- **Code Clarity:**  
  - Consider assigning the joined String to a variable (e.g. `canonicalUrl`) for clarity, and then reusing this variable.
    Example:
    var canonicalUrl = c.join('');
    b['CanonicalURL'] = canonicalUrl;
    utag.data["CanonicalURL"] = canonicalUrl;
    LBGAnalytics.datalayer.set("CanonicalURL", canonicalUrl, true);
    clova3.datalayer.set("CanonicalURL", canonicalUrl, true);
  
- **Edge Case Handling:**  
  - Although defensive coding for the event payload is not required, if future business logic entails stricter data quality requirements, consider adding basic validation to package the URL correctly.
  
- **Consistency & Comments:**  
  - Enhance inline comments for future maintainers. This ensures all logic is clearly documented, including the rationale behind the concatenation and setting on multiple layers.
  
- **Modularisation:**  
  - For potential reuse and easier testing, encapsulate the canonical URL-building logic inside a function.
  
- **Maintain ES5 Compliance:**  
  - Adhere strictly to ES5 practices (avoiding ES6 features such as arrow functions, let/const, template literals).

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**
  - Regularly review the dependencies on global objects (`utag`, `LBGAnalytics`, `clova3`) to ensure they remain available and properly initialised.
  - Document any changes in the structure of the event payload (i.e. keys used) that could impact the extension.

- **Ownership & Testing Guidelines:**
  - Assign clear ownership of this extension within your team. Include this documentation in the repository alongside the code.
  - Implement unit tests within the Tealium testing framework or your local environment to simulate events with various payloads, ensuring the extension concatenates and assigns the canonical URL correctly.
  - Monitor for errors post-deployment, particularly those relating to the availability of external objects or invalid data.

- **Version Control:**
  - Keep track of changes using version control comments or tags, specifically noting any refactoring or updates to improve code safety and maintainability.
