# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation

## 1. Extension Overview
- **Name:** Hash copy of RetailCustomerID
- **ID:** 2107
- **Type:** Crypto Extension
- **Scope:** After Load Rules
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Always

### Summary
This extension captures user interaction data from the Lloyds Bank cardnet services and tracks key conversion events through integration with the LinkedIn tracking script (`lintrk`). It handles specific URL patterns for different services and logs conversions based on user actions (App Start, App Complete). The objective is to enable analytics and optimisation for banking applications, enhancing the understanding of user flows and engagement.

---

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- `a`: Presumably denotes the event type, expected to be a string.
- `b`: Likely represents the event payload, containing various pieces of data.
- `b.CanonicalURL`: Contains the canonical URL being processed.
- `b.PegasusTagName`: Represents the name of the Pegasus tag being executed.

### Logic Flow
1. The outermost function is nested multiple times, which is likely a form of obfuscation and may serve to scope variables securely.
2. The extension checks the `CanonicalURL` for specific patterns corresponding to different bank services.
3. Depending on the matching URL, it checks the `PegasusTagName` for user actions (either "App Start" or "App Complete").
4. When conditions are met, the function logs an event via `window.lintrk` with the relevant conversion ID.
5. Each section is wrapped in a `try-catch` block to prevent script termination on error, logging any exceptions to the console.

### Dependencies
- The extension relies on `window.lintrk` for tracking conversions, which must be loaded in the parent environment. Failure to load this script can result in non-functioning tracking.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: App Start for Lloyds Cardnet
- **Input:** 
  - `b.CanonicalURL`: `contact.lloydsbank.com/cardnet/775753e9-0892-4678-a118-421b4955605c/forms/lloyds/standard`
  - `b.PegasusTagName`: `App Start`
- **Behaviour:** The extension tracks this event with `conversion_id: 19139137`.

### Scenario 2: App Complete for Lloyds Business Banking
- **Input:**
  - `b.CanonicalURL`: `businessbanking.lloydsbank.co.uk/cardnet/enquiry`
  - `b.PegasusTagName`: `App Complete`
- **Behaviour:** The extension captures the completion with `conversion_id: 19139161`.

### Edge Case Example: Non-Matching URLs
- **Input:** 
  - `b.CanonicalURL`: `https://example.com`
- **Behaviour:** No tracking event is logged as the URL does not match any of the predefined patterns.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas
- **Performance Overhead:** The deep nesting of functions may impact readability and potentially performance. It could make debugging more challenging.
- **Dependency on External Environment:** Requires the `lintrk` script to be loaded on the page. If not present, the tracking will fail silently.
- **URL Matching:** The matching against URLs is case-sensitive, and minor URL changes (e.g., adding query strings) may prevent tracking from working.
- **Hardcoded Conversion IDs:** Should the IDs change, updates in the extension will be necessary, presenting a maintenance challenge.

---

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring
- **Code Modularisation:** Consider breaking the tracking functionality into smaller, reusable functions instead of using deeply nested anonymous functions. This would improve readability and maintainability.
- **Error Logging:** While there is a `try-catch`, consider expanding error handling to provide more contextual information for failures.
- **Consistent Checks:** Centralise conversion ID handling to isolate potential changes, making it easier to update if IDs change.
- **Documentation Comments:** Add inline comments for clarity on what each section of the code accomplishes and document intention.

---

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes
- **Ownership:** Assign a maintenance owner or team to ensure ongoing updates for changes in linked services or tracking requirements.
- **Testing Guidelines:** Implement unit tests for tracking functions to ensure the accuracy of tracked data.
- **Version Control:** Maintain a changelog for modifications to the extension to document changes over time and provide context for future developers.
