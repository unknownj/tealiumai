# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: LinkedIn Custom Conversions

## 1. Extension Overview
- **Name**: LinkedIn Custom Conversions
- **ID**: 2102
- **Type**: Advanced JavaScript Code
- **Scope**: 1261
- **Status**: Active

### Summary
This extension facilitates the tracking of custom conversions on specific Lloyds Bank web forms. It listens for specific tag names associated with user interactions and triggers LinkedIn's tracking system to log conversion events depending on the form's state (e.g., App Start or App Complete). This is crucial for accurately measuring the effectiveness of digital marketing campaigns.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- `a`, `b`, `u`: Parameters defined in the IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression). 
  - `b` (eventPayload): Contains contextual information about the event, including the URL and tag names.
  
### Logic Flow
1. The extension checks if the current page's canonical URL matches specific patterns related to Lloyds Bank forms.
2. Upon matching, it examines the `PegasusTagName` from the event payload to determine if the event is an "App Start" or "App Complete".
3. Depending on the tag name, the appropriate LinkedIn conversion tracking ID is sent using `window.lintrk('track', { conversion_id: X })`.

### Dependencies
- **Global Objects**: 
  - `window.lintrk`: A function provided by the LinkedIn tracking library for logging conversion events.
- **Event Payload**: Assumes the presence of `CanonicalURL` and `PegasusTagName` in the `eventPayload`.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Conditions
- If a user lands on `/contact.lloydsbank.com/cardnet/775753e9-0892-4678-a118-421b4955605c/forms/lloyds/standard` and triggers an App Start event:
  - `window.lintrk('track', { conversion_id: 19139137 })` is executed.

### Edge Conditions
- If `PegasusTagName` contains an unexpected string or is `undefined`, the `catch` block will log an error instead of failing silently.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas
- **Missing or Incorrect Tag Names**: If the `PegasusTagName` does not match the expected patterns, no tracking event will be fired for that interaction.
- **URL Changes**: The extension relies on specific URL patterns, meaning changes to these URLs will require updates to the extension's code.
- **Logging**: Errors are logged to the console, which may be overlooked in a production environment, potentially making troubleshooting difficult.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring
- **Modularization**: Consider breaking down the code into smaller functions for easier readability and maintenance (e.g., separate functions for tracking different conversion types).
- **Error Handling**: Improvements could be made to handle specific errors dynamically instead of generic logging. 
- **Comments and Documentation**: Increase code comments explaining the purpose of sections to aid future developers.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes
- **Ownership**: The code should be maintained by the digital marketing or analytics team.
- **Testing Guidelines**: Regular testing should be implemented when changes are made to the form's structure, URLs, or the LinkedIn tracking setup.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Pay attention to any potential performance issues introduced by extensive error logging in production.

For ongoing updates, ensure the documentation stays aligned with any code changes and that developers are aware of the necessary modifications in case of new conversion types or tracking requirements.
