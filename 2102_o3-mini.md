# LinkedIn Custom Conversions Extension Documentation

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** LinkedIn Custom Conversions  
- **Extension ID:** 100040  
- **Internal ID:** 2102  
- **Type:** Advanced Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** 1261  
- **Execution Frequency:** Runs on every event that meets the load rule criteria; triggered when the extension is processed within the Tealium iQ environment

**Summary:**  
This extension is designed to track LinkedIn conversion events by sending ‘track’ commands via the global `window.lintrk` function. Depending on the URL structure and the Pegasus tag event name, the extension determines which conversion ID to trigger. Logically, separate conversion IDs are tracked for "App Start" and "App Complete" events across three different website segments:
- A Lloyds Bank cardnet standard app for contact pages.
- A business banking enquiry page.
- A commercial current accounts page.

Using regular expressions, it evaluates the correct page context and event type, ensuring that the appropriate LinkedIn conversion is recorded.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables & Objects
- **a, b, u:**  
  - Passed to the immediate function as parameters.  
  - Typically, `a` represents the event type, `b` represents the event payload with properties such as `CanonicalURL` and `PegasusTagName`, and `u` may be used to represent the Tealium tag object context (here not used explicitly in the code).

- **b.CanonicalURL:**  
  - The URL of the current page. Regular expressions check against this property to determine which conversion rule applies.

- **b.PegasusTagName:**  
  - A string indicating the name of the event (e.g. "App Start" or "App Complete") that is used to discern the conversion state.

- **window.lintrk:**  
  - A dependency on a global function provided by LinkedIn’s tracking library which is used to send conversion data.

### Logic Flow & Data Processing
- **Pattern Matching:**  
  - The code contains multiple `if` blocks that use regular expressions to match the `CanonicalURL` against expected patterns for different pages (contact cardnet form, business enquiry, and commercial current accounts).

- **Event Differentiation:**  
  - Within each URL matching block, a further check is made with a regular expression against `PegasusTagName` to determine if the event indicates an "App Start" or "App Complete" event.  
  - Depending on which event is identified, a corresponding conversion ID is used.

- **Conversion Tracking:**  
  - Once an event is identified, the code calls `window.lintrk('track', { conversion_id: <id> })` with an appropriate conversion ID. The specific conversion IDs used are:
    - For contact cardnet standard:
      - "App Start" → conversion_id: 19139137  
      - "App Complete" → conversion_id: 19139145
    - For business banking enquiry:
      - "App Start" → conversion_id: 19139153  
      - "App Complete" → conversion_id: 19139161
    - For commercial current accounts:
      - "App Start" → conversion_id: 19139169  
      - "App Complete" → conversion_id: 19139177

- **Error Handling:**  
  - The code uses try/catch blocks in each section to catch and log any errors thrown by the `window.lintrk` function call.

### Dependencies & Global Objects
- **Global Dependency:**  
  - The extension depends on `window.lintrk`, which must be loaded in the global scope by LinkedIn’s scripts to successfully track conversions.

- **Tealium Provided Objects:**  
  - The event context (`eventType`, `eventPayload`, `tagObject`) are passed by Tealium iQ and their properties (e.g., `CanonicalURL` and `PegasusTagName`) are used to drive logic in this extension.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Contact Cardnet Standard Page
- **Environment:**  
  - URL: "https://contact.lloydsbank.com/cardnet/775753e9-0892-4678-a118-421b4955605c/forms/lloyds/standard"  
  - PegasusTagName: "App Start"
- **Expected Behaviour:**  
  - The URL regex matches the contact page condition.
  - The event "App Start" is identified, firing `window.lintrk('track', { conversion_id: 19139137 })`.
  
- **Alternate Scenario (Edge):**  
  - If the event is "App Complete" on the same URL, it fires conversion_id: 19139145.

### Scenario 2: Business Banking Enquiry Page
- **Environment:**  
  - URL: "https://businessbanking.lloydsbank.co.uk/cardnet/enquiry"  
  - PegasusTagName: "App Start"
- **Expected Behaviour:**  
  - Matches the business enquiry URL pattern.
  - Identifies "App Start", hence triggers conversion_id: 19139153.
- **Alternate Scenario (Edge):**  
  - If "App Complete" is detected, conversion_id: 19139161 is triggered.

### Scenario 3: Commercial Current Accounts Page
- **Environment:**  
  - PegasusTagName contains "Pegasus | Lloyds Commercial | Current Accounts | Sales | ..." and "App Start" is part of the string.
- **Expected Behaviour:**  
  - Match is made on the tag name pattern.
  - If “App Start” is found, conversion_id: 19139169 is triggered.
- **Alternate Scenario (Edge):**  
  - For “App Complete”, conversion_id: 19139177 is sent.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **URL & Tag Name Specificity:**  
  - The extension relies on strict regular expression matching for both the URL and the event name. Slight changes to the URL structure or tag naming conventions may result in the conversion not firing correctly.

- **Global Function Dependency:**  
  - If `window.lintrk` is not loaded before this extension runs, the code will throw errors. Although errors are caught and logged, conversion events will not be tracked.

- **Extension Conflicts:**  
  - There may be potential conflicts with other Tealium extensions that modify the same event payload properties (e.g. `CanonicalURL` or `PegasusTagName`). Coordination is needed to ensure modifications do not break these conditions.

- **Overlapping Conditions:**  
  - Should a page URL match more than one regex condition, the code will execute multiple try blocks. Ensure that pages are structured uniquely to avoid double firing or conflicting conversion actions.

---

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Modularisation:**  
  - Consider refactoring the common conversion tracking logic into a helper function to reduce code repetition. For example, a function that accepts the conversion IDs based on event type and handles the try/catch block.

- **Defensive Coding Improvements:**  
  - Although defensive coding for the provided `eventType`, `eventPayload`, or `tagObject` is not required, additional logging may assist in debugging transformations in complex deployments.

- **Code Formatting & Comments:**  
  - Enhance inline commenting to clearly delineate each section's purpose (e.g. separate sections for each URL condition).  
  - Maintain consistent code formatting to improve readability, for instance by aligning similar if/else statements.

- **Regular Expression Management:**  
  - Store repeated regular expression patterns in variables to improve maintainability. This would allow easier adjustments if the patterns change in the future.

_Note: All recommendations must adhere to ES5 syntax, avoiding ES2015+ features such as arrow functions, template literals, let/const declarations etc._

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Testing:**  
  - Perform regular tests upon any changes to website URLs or tag naming conventions. Include tests to simulate the presence or absence of the global `window.lintrk` function.

- **Ownership & Version Control:**  
  - Document any changes made to the extension in a version control system. Assign clear ownership for maintaining the conversion mapping as business requirements evolve.

- **Error Logging:**  
  - Monitor browser console logs for errors related to the extension. Although errors are handled, recurring issues should prompt code review or potential restructuring of the conversion logic.

- **Dependency Checks:**  
  - Regularly verify the proper loading of external tracking libraries (LinkedIn’s `lintrk` library) to ensure the extension functions as intended.

- **Documentation Updates:**  
  - Keep this documentation updated with any changes or enhancements to the extension code. Ensure that new edge cases or additional URL conditions are recorded and highlighted.
