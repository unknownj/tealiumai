# MCMA v2 - Mortgage Calc and AIP Extension Documentation

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** MCMA v2 - Mortgage Calc and AIP
- **ID:** 2108 (Extension Instance), with an underlying extensionId of 100040
- **Type:** Advanced Javascript Code
- **Scope:** After Load Rules
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Always

**Summary:**  
This extension is designed to persist and process financial values from a mortgage calculator scenario to help identify mass affluent traffic. It collects income and savings data from various form fields on the page. The extension applies a series of eligibility checks and validations to categorise users into predefined segments (represented as category codes) that are then sent via Tealium Collect. In addition, it integrates with auxiliary libraries (e.g. LBGAnalytics) and uses a global data layer (utag.data) for storing and manipulating data.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Initialisation and Conditions
- **Purpose:**  
  The extension is conditioned to only run when `udo.PegasusTagName` contains the value "mortgage" (ignoring case). This ensures that the code executes on relevant pages.

### Key Variables and Structures
- **utag.data.MCMA:**  
  An object initialised on the global `utag.data` namespace. If `utag.data.MCMA` is not already defined, it is created with the following properties:
  - `data`: An object to store field values keyed by their field names.
  - `set`: A function to assign values (converted to strings) to any key within `data`. A log entry is optionally made via `LBGAnalytics.analyticsLog`.
  - `eligibilityExpressions`: An array containing conditions such as `"PegasusProductGroup contains Calc"` and `"JourneyName contains AIP"` which may be used later for additional validations (even though they are not directly evaluated in the shown code).
  - `dataItems`: An array that defines objects for each data point (income1, income2, savings). Each object defines:
    - `fieldName` (e.g. "income1")
    - `fieldCode` (used in the segmented output e.g. "I" for income)
    - `fieldSelectors`: An array of CSS selectors corresponding to potential form fields.
    - `validation`: A function to validate the field input (ensuring the value is defined and a number).

### Event Handling
- **Event Listener Setup:**  
  An event listener is attached to the document for the `"change"` event. When a field is changed:
  - The event target’s value is captured.
  - The code checks if the changed element matches any selector in each `dataItem`.
  - If a match is found and the value passes the validation check, the corresponding field value is persisted using `utag.data.MCMA.set`.

### Data Processing and Value Segmentation
- **Income Calculation:**  
  If `utag.data.MCMA.data.income1` exists:
  - The code attempts to retrieve an alternative income value from a top income banner (`AIPYI`) using the `LBGAnalytics` global object.  
  - It distinguishes cases where there is:
    - A single applicant (only income1 exists)
    - Two applicants (combined incomes from income1 and income2).
  - The highest income is compared against thresholds to assign a segment code (`ValueSeg`) ranging from '1' to '4'.  
  - Specific conditions are applied if there are multiple applicants (e.g. using highest income vs combined income).

- **Savings Override:**  
  The extension then checks if savings data exists:
  - Savings are used as a possible override for the segment calculation.
  - Based on parsed savings value, appropriate segment codes are assigned if the current `ValueSeg` is not set or falls below a defined threshold.

- **Output Assignment:**  
  Finally, if a valid `ValueSeg` is determined:
  - The value is set into the output object (`b["MCMAflgs"]`), as well as directly to `utag.data.MCMAflgs` and via an external integration `clova3.datalayer.set`.
  - A log entry is made indicating the assigned mortgage segment.

### Dependencies on Global Objects/Libraries
- **utag.data:**  
  Used for maintaining a global state for the extension.
- **LBGAnalytics:**  
  Used for logging analytics events and attempting to retrieve a banner element’s text.
- **clova3.datalayer:**  
  An external data layer mechanism to set the computed mortgage segment.
- **document & window.performance:**  
  Utilised to add event listeners and check for the document load event.

## 3. Usage Examples

### A. Normal Scenario
1. A user opens a mortgage calculator page where `udo.PegasusTagName` contains "mortgage".
2. The form is initialised and the extension sets up event listeners.
3. The user enters a valid numeric value in a field that matches one of the provided selectors (e.g. `[name='applicantOneBasicIncome']`).
4. The change event triggers the listener, which validates the input and persists it to `utag.data.MCMA.data.income1`.
5. If the alternative income banner is present, its value (after parsing) is used; otherwise, just the field value is used.
6. Depending on the income thresholds and conditions (and possibly the number of applicants), a segment ('1', '2', '3', or '4') is computed.
7. The segment is then assigned to multiple outputs (`b["MCMAflgs"]`, `utag.data.MCMAflgs`, and `clova3.datalayer`).

### B. Edge Condition – Invalid or Missing Values
1. If a user enters a non-numeric or poorly formatted input:
   - The validation function fails and no value is set.
2. If the computed income values are NaN:
   - `ValueSeg` is set to 'NA' to indicate an invalid segmentation.
3. If savings are provided and the computed `ValueSeg` is not set or marked 'NA':
   - The savings values may override and set `ValueSeg` to an appropriate segment code based on predefined thresholds.
4. Should any exceptions occur during processing (e.g. during division, parsing errors, or missing DOM elements), try/catch blocks ensure that the extension does not non-gracefully break the page.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- The extension assumes the existence of `utag`, `LBGAnalytics`, and `clova3` on the page. If these objects are not available, parts of the code (such as logging and datalayer setting) will silently fail.
- The extension is designed to run only after load rules. If form elements are dynamically added later, the initial event binding on page load may not capture them unless the event bubbles.
- Since multiple selectors are used to capture similar data (especially with income and savings fields), there might be cases where selectors overlap or return multiple matches. This can lead to unexpected behaviour if more than one candidate field is triggered.
- Using a single event listener on the document for change events may add overhead on pages with many interactive elements.
- The segmentation logic uses fixed numeric thresholds. If these thresholds or business rules change, the extension code will require a manual update.
- In scenarios where form inputs are manipulated by other scripts, there is potential for conflicts in data capture or event handling.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks:**  
  Although the code has try/catch blocks, consider adding explicit checks for the presence of the dependent global objects before usage (except for eventType or eventPayload as they are guaranteed).
  
- **Modularisation:**  
  Consider breaking the code into smaller functions. For example, separate functions could be created for:
  - Validating input
  - Segment calculation based on income
  - Segment override based on savings
  This would improve readability and ease testing.

- **Code Comments & Logging:**  
  Expand the inline comments to clearly state the purpose of each major block. Logging more contextual information might assist in debugging issues in production environments.

- **Event Delegation:**  
  While using a document-level event listener is acceptable, it might be beneficial to scope the event listener to a container element (if available) to reduce unnecessary iterations and improve performance.

- **Consistent Data Parsing:**  
  The code alternates between using values from form fields and parsed values from DOM elements (via text extraction from the banner). Consider unifying the approach to reduce potential inconsistencies in parsing numeric values.

- **Threshold Flexibility:**  
  If business rules around thresholds are subject to change, consider externalising these thresholds to a configuration file or data object.

*Note:* All updates must remain compatible with ES5; therefore, any refactoring must avoid using ES6+ syntax such as arrow functions, template literals, or block scoped variables (let/const).

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**
  - Regularly review the selectors specified in `dataItems` to ensure they remain valid as the website undergoes updates.
  - Monitor performance impacts, especially if changes in the DOM or additional event listeners are introduced.
  - Update the numeric thresholds and segmentation logic if business requirements change.

- **Ownership:**
  - Specify an owner or team responsible for this extension in your internal documentation. Include contact details for questions or concerns.

- **Testing Guidelines:**
  - Write unit tests for individual functions such as data validation and segment calculation.
  - Perform integration tests on pages using the mortgage calculator to ensure that data flows correctly from form inputs to the computed segment.
  - Ensure the extension is tested across multiple browsers (as ES5 is targeted) to catch any discrepancies in event handling or DOM manipulation.

- **Documentation Updates:**
  - Maintain this document alongside version control to ensure that any changes to the extension code are reflected in the documentation.
  - Provide inline code comments to help explain non-obvious logic or dependencies.
