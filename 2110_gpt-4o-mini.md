# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name**: CUET: Clarity suppression and cookie defaults
- **ID**: 2110
- **Type**: Advanced Javascript Code
- **Scope**: 1611
- **Execution Frequency**: Active

### Summary
This Tealium iQ extension monitors for the presence of Clarity scripts on the page. When Clarity scripts are detected, the extension removes them and stops any Clarity functionality, including suppressing any associated cookies. This is particularly useful in scenarios where the use of Clarity may conflict with privacy regulations or organizational policies on tracking and analytics.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- **observer**: An instance of `MutationObserver` that watches for changes in the DOM (Document Object Model). It specifically tracks added nodes to identify if any new scripts are related to Clarity.

### Logic Flow
1. The `MutationObserver` is instantiated to observe the document.
2. It listens for child node additions in the entire document (`subtree: true`).
3. When new nodes are added, it checks each one to see if it is a `<script>` tag and if its `src` attribute contains "clarity".
4. If such a script is found:
   - The script node is removed from the DOM.
   - Clarity functionality is stopped by invoking `window.clarity('stop')`.
   - Consent for Clarity is revoked via `window.clarity('consent', false)`.
   - Any existing Clarity queue is cleared.

### Dependencies
- **Global Objects**: Relies on the global `window` object for invoking Clarity functions.
- **MutationObserver**: This is a native JavaScript feature that may have varying levels of support in older browsers, which is important to consider during implementation.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Operation
1. **Scenario**: A user visits a webpage that has Clarity integrated.
   - The extension detects `script` elements associated with Clarity when the page is loaded.
   - Clarity scripts are removed, and tracking is disabled.

### Edge Conditions
1. **Potential Duplicate Scripts**: If Clarity scripts are dynamically added multiple times by other extensions or libraries:
   - The observer will continually remove them, ensuring no tracking occurs.
   
2. **Failure to Load Clarity Properly**: If there are other scripts that also attempt to influence Clarity, the extension may prevent those scripts from functioning as designed.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Browser Compatibility**: The `MutationObserver` API may not work in older browsers that do not support it, leading to failures in removing Clarity scripts.
- **Script Timing**: The timing of script execution can affect the ability of the extension to catch Clarity scripts if they are added before the extension has been initialised.
- **Interference with Other Extensions**: If other extensions attempt to interact with Clarity or modify script elements, conflicts can arise, leading to unpredictable behaviour.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Modularisation**: Consider separating functionality into smaller functions for clarity and maintainability.
- **Documentation**: Enhance in-code comments for better understanding of each segment.
- **Error Handling**: Although defensive coding is not suggested for eventType and eventPayload, consider wrapping code in try-catch blocks to gracefully handle unexpected runtime errors.
- **Performance**: Regularly assess the performance implications of `MutationObserver` and explore alternatives if unnecessary load is observed.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ownership**: Assign a dedicated team member to oversee ongoing reviews and updates of this extension.
- **Testing Guidelines**: Establish a testing approach to ensure the extension behaves correctly across different browsers and under various scenarios.
- **Version Control**: Maintain version control for code editions to keep track of changes over time.
- **Documentation Updates**: Consistently update this documentation to reflect any changes in functionality or implementation details.
