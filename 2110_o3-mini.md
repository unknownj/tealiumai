# CUET: Clarity Suppression and Cookie Defaults Documentation

This document outlines the purpose, workings, and guidance for maintaining the CUET extension within Tealium iQ.

---

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** CUET: Clarity suppression and cookie defaults  
- **Extension ID:** 100040  
- **Internal Code ID:** 2110  
- **Type:** Advanced Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** 1611  
- **Execution Frequency:** The extension is executed once per load when triggered by Tealium iQ (via a self-invoking function).  

**Summary:**  
This extension is designed to monitor the document for any dynamically-added script elements that contain the substring “clarity” in their src attribute. When such a script is detected, the extension removes it from the DOM and sends commands to the global Clarity tracking object (assumed to exist) to stop further processing, disable its consent mode, and clear any queued commands. The primary goal is to suppress Clarity’s tracking and cookie defaults, ensuring that unwanted tracking does not take place.

---

## 2. Code Explanation

### a. Core Functionality
- **Mutation Observer:**  
  A MutationObserver is used to track changes in the DOM. It monitors for additions of nodes within the document (observing using a subtree scan).

- **Processing Added Nodes:**  
  For each mutation record (each set of added nodes), the code iterates over the nodes and checks:
  - If the node is an Element node (`nodeType === 1`).
  - If the element is a script tag (using `matches('script')`).
  - If the script's `src` attribute contains the substring “clarity” (matching via a regular expression).

- **Action on Detection:**  
  When a matching script is found:
  - The script element is removed from the document.
  - Global Clarity commands are issued:
    - `window.clarity('stop');` – instructs Clarity to halt.
    - `window.clarity('consent', false);` – disables consent.
    - `window.clarity.q = [];` – clears any queued instructions.
  - (Optional) The observer disconnect method is present in the code but commented out. This would typically prevent further observation after the first match.

### b. Key Variables and Parameters
- **a, b, u:**  
  The self-invoking function is defined with these parameters. In the Tealium context:
  - `eventType` is passed as `a` (expected to be a string describing the event triggering the tag).
  - `eventPayload` is passed as `b` (an object containing event-related data).
  - `tagObject` is passed as `u` (the current tag extension context).
  Although these parameters are not used directly within this extension, they are in keeping with the Tealium extension signature.

- **observer:**  
  An instance of MutationObserver assigned to the variable `observer`. It sets up the DOM mutation listener on the document’s root element.

### c. Dependencies
- **Global Clarity Object:**  
  The extension depends on the presence of the global `window.clarity` object and its methods (‘stop’ and ‘consent’), as well as a property (`q`) used to store queued commands.
  
- **DOM API:**  
  The extension relies on standard DOM APIs such as MutationObserver and Element methods (`matches`).

## 3. Usage Examples

### Example 1: Normal Operation
- **Scenario:** A third-party script (or another Tealium extension) asynchronously injects a script tag into the DOM with a src URL like "https://example.com/clarity.js".
- **Flow:**  
  - The MutationObserver detects the new script node.
  - It confirms that the script`s src contains “clarity”.
  - The script tag is then removed immediately.
  - Clarity is sent commands to stop execution and clear its command queue.
  - Outcome: Clarity tracking is suppressed for that page load.

### Example 2: Edge Condition – Late Injection
- **Scenario:** Multiple scripts are added dynamically after the page load and one of these scripts is a Clarity script.
- **Flow:**  
  - The MutationObserver continuously monitors the entire DOM (`childList` plus `subtree`).
  - Even if the Clarity script is injected later, it is intercepted, removed, and the Clarity commands are dispatched.
  - Outcome: Late additions of Clarity scripts are similarly blocked, ensuring consistent tracking suppression.

### Example 3: No Clarity Script Present
- **Scenario:** No script with “clarity” in the src is added.
- **Flow:**  
  - The observer monitors but never finds a matching element.
  - No action is taken and the observer continues to run (unless later disconnected).
  - Outcome: The extension has minimal performance impact as its checks result in no modifications.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Persistent Observer:**  
  The observer is not disconnected after detecting (or not detecting) a Clarity script because the disconnect line is commented out.  
  • This may lead to unnecessary processing if the page experiences heavy DOM mutations.

- **Global Object Dependency:**  
  The extension assumes the global `window.clarity` object is available and that it responds to the commands as expected. If another script overrides or modifies `window.clarity`, the suppression may fail.

- **Potential Conflicts:**  
  • If another Tealium extension or external script relies on Clarity’s execution, this extension’s removal of the script and halting of Clarity may lead to unexpected behaviour.
  • The extension might also conflict with other scripts that manage DOM mutations if they have similar observers.

- **ES6 Syntax Usage in an ES5 Requirement Context:**  
  While the functional logic remains intact, note that the code uses arrow functions and block-scoped variables (const). As the team is required to support ES5, there might be a necessity to refactor these parts (see recommendations).

---

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

Given that support for ES5 is required, consider the following best practices and improvements:

- **Replace ES6 Syntax:**  
  • Convert arrow functions to standard function expressions.  
  • Replace `const` with `var` to ensure full ES5 compliance.

- **Defensive DOM Checks:**  
  • Although the code depends on standard DOM APIs, consider checking for the existence of `document.documentElement` before invoking observer.observe.

- **Separate Observer Callback:**  
  • Refactor the observer callback into a named function to improve code clarity and facilitate unit testing.

- **Observer Lifecycle Management:**  
  • Evaluate whether to disconnect the observer after a successful script removal. This could reduce overhead if no further monitoring is needed.

- **Code Modularity:**  
  • Encapsulate the mutation observer setup and processing logic into a helper module or function, making it easier to maintain and update the logic in the future.

*Note:* Do not add defensive coding for the availability of eventType or eventPayload as these are guaranteed to be present.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  • Periodically review the extension to ensure that the assumptions about the window.clarity API remain valid.  
  • Monitor any changes made by Clarity or updates to third-party resources that might affect DOM node patterns.

- **Ownership:**  
  • Designate an owner or team responsible for tracking and testing updates to this extension, particularly if Clarity’s API or behaviour changes.

- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  • Maintain a suite of tests (manual or automated) that simulate both normal and edge behaviours (e.g. dynamic injection of Clarity scripts).  
  • Verify that the extension does not introduce performance issues, especially on pages with heavy DOM manipulation.

- **Documentation Updates:**  
  • Keep this document updated with any code changes or workflow alterations.  
  • Add comments in the code where necessary to provide context, especially in areas where observer disconnection or compatibility handling is addressed.

By following the above guidelines and documentation, developers and stakeholders will have a clear understanding of the extension’s purpose, functionality, and requirements for future modifications.
