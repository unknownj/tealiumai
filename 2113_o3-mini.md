# Performance Marks for Timing Measurement Extension Documentation

This document provides an in-depth overview and explanation of the "Performance Marks for Timing Measurement" extension for Tealium iQ. It includes details on functionality, usage examples, potential gotchas, refactoring recommendations and future maintenance guidelines.

---

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name**: Performance Marks for Timing Measurement
- **ID**: 100036 (extensionId), Internal ID: 2113
- **Type**: Javascript Code
- **Scope**: DOM Ready
- **Execution Frequency**: Run Once

**Summary**:  
This extension is designed to measure and record performance timings within the LBGAnalytics framework. It provides two key methods:  
- `markStart(markName)`: Captures the start timestamp for a particular event or performance measurement.
- `mark(markName)`: Calculates the current timestamp and computes the elapsed time from both page load and a previously marked start (if available). It then packages these timings (as well as an incremented product code) into a product string format and caches it with correlations stored in both an internal array and localStorage.

The primary purpose is to track user interactions and performance metrics to help with analysing the site's performance over defined intervals.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables and Global Dependencies

- **LBGAnalytics**: The global analytics object that contains `events`, `datalayer`, and `correlations`.
- **markName**: A string identifier supplied by the user that must be under 100 characters.
- **markTime**: The current time in milliseconds (obtained via `new Date().getTime()`) used to compute elapsed timings.
- **this.markStarts**: An object used to store the start timestamps keyed by `markName`.
- **dl**: A local alias for the data layer cache retrieved by `LBGAnalytics.datalayer.getCache()`. It contains critical timestamps such as `PageLoadTimeStamp` and `UtagViewTimeStamp`.

### Function: markStart(markName)

1. **Input Validation**:  
   - Checks that the provided `markName` is a string.
   - Confirms that `markName` does not exceed 100 characters.
   - Returns early without logging if these checks fail.

2. **Timestamp Capture**:  
   - Retrieves the current timestamp using `new Date().getTime()`.
   - Initialises (or reuses) `this.markStarts` and stores the timestamp keyed by the `markName`.

3. **Method Chaining**:  
   - Returns `this` to allow any future chaining of method calls if required.

### Function: mark(markName)

1. **Input Validation**:  
   - Ensures `markName` is a valid string and does not exceed the length limit.

2. **Timestamp Calculations**:  
   - Captures the current time as `markTime`.
   - Retrieves the data layer cache (`dl`) for page performance timestamps:
     - `PageLoadTimeStamp`: Time when the page was loaded.
     - `UtagViewTimeStamp`: Time when the Tealium view was triggered.
   - Computes `timeSincePageLoad` and `timeSincePageView` by subtracting the respective cached timestamps from `markTime`.
   - Applies boundary validations so that both elapsed times must not exceed 30 minutes (1800000 milliseconds) and cannot be negative.

3. **Relative Timing for Specific Mark**:  
   - Checks if there is an earlier start timestamp stored for the same `markName`.
   - If found and valid (i.e. `markTime` is greater than the stored value and within the 30-minute window), it calculates the additional elapsed time and formats it as `relativeEventValues`.

4. **Formatting the Product String**:  
   - Constructs a semicolon-delimited string containing:
     - An empty category.
     - An incrementing product identifier prefixed with "e" (converted to base36).
     - Empty quantity and price fields.
     - A concatenation of events to capture timing details:
       - `event144` flag.
       - `event145`: time since page load.
       - `event146`: time since page view.
       - Optional relative events (`event147` and `event148`) if applicable.
     - `eVar144` with the provided mark name.

5. **Caching the Product String**:  
   - Appends the resulting product string to the global `LBGAnalytics.correlations.cache`.
   - Updates localStorage with the new correlations cache data (stored after JSON.stringify).

6. **Method Chaining**:  
   - Returns `this` to allow chained calls.

### Dependencies on Global Objects and Libraries

- **Global LBGAnalytics Object**:  
  The methods assume that `LBGAnalytics` and its sub-components (`events`, `datalayer`, and `correlations`) are already defined and available on the global scope.
  
- **localStorage**:  
  Uses the browser’s `localStorage` API to persist the correlations cache.

- **Date API**:  
  Relying on the standard `Date` object for timestamp extraction in ES5 fashion.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Scenario

1. **Initialization of a Timing Mark**  
   - Call the method to set a start time for a named event:
     > LBGAnalytics.events.markStart("myEvent");
     
   - This logs the start timestamp for "myEvent" that can be later referenced.

2. **Recording a Timing Mark**  
   - Later in code, mark the event by calling:
     > LBGAnalytics.events.mark("myEvent");
     
   - The method calculates:
     - How long since the page was loaded.
     - How long since the view event.
     - How long since "myEvent" started (if `markStart` was called earlier).
   - The formatted product string will be added to the correlations cache and stored in localStorage.

### Edge Conditions

- **Invalid Mark Name**:  
  - If a non-string or a string longer than 100 characters is passed, both functions perform an early return without logging any data.
  
- **Timing Boundary Conditions**:  
  - If the calculated elapsed time since page load or view exceeds 30 minutes or is less than zero, the mark function returns without logging. This ensures that stale or future timestamps are not processed.

- **Missing markStart**:  
  - If no start mark has been recorded for a given `markName`, `relativeEventValues` will remain an empty string. The product string will still include the overall page load and view timings, but without relative timings.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Silent Failures on Input Validation**:  
  - When `markName` is invalid (i.e. not a string or longer than 100 characters), the functions return without any error output. This could make debugging difficult if the wrong type of data is passed.
  
- **Time Boundary Checks**:  
  - If the elapsed time exceeds 30 minutes or is negative, no product string is logged. This strict approach may need reviewing if performance metrics beyond 30 minutes are eventually required.

- **Global Dependency Risks**:  
  - The extension is closely coupled with the global `LBGAnalytics` object. If any part of this framework is altered or not present, the extension may fail or exhibit unexpected behaviour.
  
- **localStorage Availability**:  
  - Reliance on localStorage assumes that storage is available and not blocked. In cases where localStorage is disabled or unavailable (e.g. in incognito modes or certain browser settings), data persistence might fail silently.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Error Handling & Logging**:  
  - Consider adding console warnings or error logs when input validations fail. This can aid in debugging without compromising runtime performance.
  
- **Modularisation**:  
  - Modularise common functionality (such as the repeated time-bound checks) into helper functions. This improves code readability and maintainability.
  
- **Constant Variables for Magic Numbers**:  
  - Extract timing limits (e.g., 1000 * 60 * 30) into clearly named constants (e.g. MAX_ELAPSED_TIME) to clarify their purpose.
  
- **Data Object Clarity**:  
  - Construct the product string using intermediary variables to make each segment’s purpose more explicit. This could reduce mistakes when changes are necessary.

- **Code Comments for Critical Sections**:  
  - Enhance inline comments to describe each step further, especially in the time validation and product string construction parts.

*Note*: While improvements are recommended, remember to adhere to ES5 syntax and avoid ES2015/ES6 constructs such as arrow functions, template literals, or the use of let/const.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Testing Guidelines**:  
  - Develop unit tests covering all edge cases, including:
    - Valid and invalid values for `markName`
    - Cases where the elapsed time boundaries are exceeded
    - Verifying that localStorage is correctly updated.
  - Integration tests should verify that correlated product strings are accurately created and stored.

- **Ownership and Version Control**:  
  - Identify the team or individual responsible for maintaining the LBGAnalytics framework and its extensions.
  - Document any dependencies on other extensions or scripts to keep track of potential conflicts in the future.

- **Regular Code Reviews**:  
  - Schedule periodic reviews of the extension to ensure compatibility with updates to the Tealium framework or any changes in the website’s performance requirements.
  
- **Future Enhancements**:  
  - Evaluate if the extension requirements evolve (e.g. supporting additional performance metrics) and plan for safe refactoring sessions.
  - Consider configuration-driven approaches where timing thresholds and other parameters can be dynamically set rather than hardcoded.
