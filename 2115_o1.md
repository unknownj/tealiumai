# Appsflyer : SmartScript Extension - Documentation

This document provides a thorough description of the Tealium iQ Advanced JavaScript Code extension named **“Appsflyer : SmartScript”**. The content below is structured for easy sharing with developers, stakeholders, and technical audiences.

---

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name**: Appsflyer : SmartScript  
- **Extension ID**: 2115  
- **Extension Type**: Advanced JavaScript Code  
- **Scope**: DOM Ready  
- **Execution Frequency**: Run Once  

### Summary of Purpose

This extension integrates and manages AppsFlyer tracking (e.g., generating OneLink URLs, capturing and storing query parameters such as Google Click IDs, and preparing direct click URLs). It provides a mechanism to:

1. Collect and store incoming URL parameters in local storage.  
2. Create dynamic URLs (e.g., AppsFlyer OneLink URLs) by appending the necessary tracking parameters.  
3. Generate QR codes based on these tracking parameters, enabling easy scanning and attributing traffic sources.  

It is designed to ensure that any incoming marketing parameters (such as gclid, fbclid, etc.) remain accessible for building advanced tracking URLs, while also skipping certain domains or referrers if specified.

---

## 2. Code Explanation

Below is a conceptual breakdown of how the extension processes data and what main objects or functions it uses.

### 2.1 Key Variables and Functions

1. **Local Storage Keys**  
   - `ss_incoming_params`: An array-like structure stored in local storage, preserving any URL query parameters (e.g., “gclid”, “fbclid”) across the user visit.  
   - `SS_WEB_REFERRER`: Another local storage entry storing the document referrer for further usage.  

2. **Global Constants and Helpers**  
   - `AF_KEYWORDS`, `GOOGLE_CLICK_ID`, `FACEBOOK_CLICK_ID`, `GBRAID`, `WBRAID`: Constants for various query parameters relevant to tracking.  
   - `AF_CUSTOM_EXCLUDE_PARAMS_KEYS` and `GCLID_EXCLUDE_PARAMS_KEYS`: Lists of parameter keys that should not be overridden or that have special handling rules.  
   - `isSkippedURL`: Checks if the current URL or the referrer URL contains any string from a skip list. If found, subsequent code may decide not to build a OneLink URL.  
   - `getGoogleClickIdParameters`: Builds the correct object for handling Google AdWords parameters (including associated ad keyword).  
   - `stringifyParameters`: Transforms a dictionary of key-value pairs into a query string.  
   - `getParameterValue`: Retrieves values from the previously saved parameters (from local storage) if present, or a default value, if configured.  
   - `isIOS` / `isUACHSupported`: Detect iOS or if the user agent data can be used.  
   - `getQueryParamsAndSaveToLocalStorage`: Extracts the incoming query parameters from the current page URL and stores them in local storage for later retrieval.  
   - `saveWebReferrer`: Saves the document referrer into local storage, unless it has the same origin.  
   - `removeExpiredLocalStorageItems`: Cleans up expired items from local storage.  
   - `aggregateValuesFromParameters` and `getCurrentURLParams`: Utility functions that help gather a set of relevant parameter keys into a single object from local storage.  
   - `validateAndMappedParams`: Pulls actual or default values for key parameters, doing final transformations (such as mapping “pid” to “af_media_source”, etc.).  
   - `createImpressionsLink`: Prepares an “impressions tracking” URL with user-agent data appended.  
   - `QRCode`: A constructor-like function (included in the script) that generates and manages creation of QR codes. This is a large portion of the code that handles canvas or SVG drawing for the final QR code image.  

3. **Primary Functions**  
   - **`window.AF_SMART_SCRIPT.generateOneLinkURL`**:  
     - Validates the base OneLink URL.  
     - Checks skip lists for referrer and current URL.  
     - Constructs final query parameters from local storage (including gclid, fbclid, etc.).  
     - Appends those parameters to the base OneLink URL.  
     - Exposes a helper `displayQrCode` method, which uses the deeper QR code functionality to display a code with the final tracking link.  
   - **`window.AF_SMART_SCRIPT.generateDirectClickURL`**:  
     - Similar approach but used for direct click tracking URLs, particularly for mobile app deep-linking flows (iOS, Android).  
     - Retrieves stored parameters and organises them correctly for AppsFlyer endpoints.  

### 2.2 Logic Flow Overview

1. **Initial Setup**  
   - On DOM Ready, the extension runs.  
   - It first removes any expired local storage items and then calls `getQueryParamsAndSaveToLocalStorage(window.location.href)`. This ensures the incoming URL parameters are stored if relevant.  
   - It then calls `saveWebReferrer()` to store the current document referrer.  

2. **Parameter Handling and OneLink Generation**  
   - When `generateOneLinkURL` is invoked, the extension:  
     1. Checks if the URL is in a blocklist/skip list.  
     2. Merges local storage parameters with any default or override values.  
     3. Appends them to build a final OneLink tracking URL.  
     4. Optionally calls `createImpressionsLink` to produce an “impressions” pixel URL.  

3. **QR Code**  
   - If someone calls `displayQrCode`, a new QRCode instance is created, hooking into either `<canvas>` or an inline SVG representation.  
   - It respects user-provided styling (e.g., colour or logo).  
   - The final link includes appended parameters required for tracking.  

4. **Direct Click URL**  
   - `generateDirectClickURL` ensures a correct configuration for app deep linking, building a URL for iOS/Android or custom platforms.  

### 2.3 External or Global Dependencies

- **Local Storage**: The extension extensively uses `localStorage`, so the environment must have localStorage enabled.  
- **Window / Document**: The script references `window.location.href` and `document.referrer`.  
- **Global `navigator`**: Used by functions like `isUACHSupported` (checks `navigator.userAgentData`).  
- **QR Code Library**: The code includes an embedded QR Code library that draws either in `<canvas>` or via an SVG approach.

## 3. Usage Examples

### 3.1 Typical Domain Visit with Query Parameters
1. A user visits “https://www.example.com?gclid=1234&fbclid=ABC”.  
2. Upon DOM Ready, the extension stores “gclid=1234” and “fbclid=ABC” in local storage under “ss_incoming_params”.  
3. Later, `generateOneLinkURL` merges these parameters with your AppsFlyer OneLink URL:  
   - Base: “https://appsflyer.onelink.me/xyz?”  
   - Query: “pid=GoogleAds&gclid=1234&fbclid=ABC…”  
4. The extension can generate a QR code for the new link if required.

### 3.2 Skipping Certain Referrers or URLs
- If your skip lists contain certain domain snippets (e.g., `internalstaging.com`), and the user’s referrer includes “internalstaging.com”, the extension may skip generating a OneLink URL altogether.  

### 3.3 Direct Mobile Deep Link
- With “generateDirectClickURL”, you provide platform = “ios”, “app_id” = “com.brand.iosApp”.  
- The extension merges the stored “pid” and “c” (campaign) for iOS, then appends the fallback `redirectURL`.  
- This final link is used to open your app for iOS while tracking the traffic with AppsFlyer.  

### 3.4 Generating a QR Code
```html
<!-- Embedding an element for QR code display: -->
<div id="qrContainer"></div>

<script>
    var urlResult = window.AF_SMART_SCRIPT.generateOneLinkURL({
      oneLinkURL: "https://appsflyer.onelink.me/xyz",
      afParameters: { mediaSource: { keys: ["utm_source"], defaultValue: "DefaultMedia" }, /* ... */ }
    });
    if (urlResult) {
      window.AF_SMART_SCRIPT.displayQrCode("qrContainer", {
        logo: "https://www.example.com/logo.png",
        codeColor: "#FF0000"
      });
    }
</script>
```
This snippet displays a QR code in your “qrContainer” element, showing the final OneLink URL in red with a custom logo.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

1. **Dependency on Local Storage**  
   - If local storage is disabled or restricted, some parameter storage may not be possible.  
   - The extension does not handle fallback storage mechanisms.  

2. **Skip Lists**  
   - Overly broad skip-list entries could erroneously skip the entire OneLink generation process.  
   - Ensure domains or partial domain matches are carefully chosen.  

3. **Referrer Handling**  
   - The extension only stores the referrer if it differs in origin from the current site. This can sometimes exclude subdomain transitions if they share the same origin.  

4. **QR Code Rendering**  
   - The large embedded QR code library may increase overall script size.  
   - On older devices or browsers, performance might be impacted during canvas or SVG rendering.  

5. **Impressions Link**  
   - The code attempts to create an “impressions” URL using user-agent data. If the environment does not support certain user agent properties, the data appended might be blank.  

6. **Potential Conflicts**  
   - If another extension uses the same local storage key “ss_incoming_params” or overwrites `LOCAL_STORAGE_VALUES.SS_WEB_REFERRER`, it may cause confusion or lost data.  
   - Overriding `window.AF_SMART_SCRIPT` can break existing references if you have custom scripts.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

Below are general improvements while remaining within ES5 constraints and avoiding arrow functions or other modern syntax:

1. **Modular Organisation**  
   - The extension currently contains many functions and large chunks of code in one place. Splitting them into smaller segments or utility modules for checking parameters, constructing URLs, and QR code generation can improve clarity.  

2. **More Granular Functions**  
   - Functions like `generateOneLinkURL` have numerous validations. Consider extracting each set of tasks into smaller functions that are called in sequence (e.g., “validateURL”, “buildParameters”, “appendTrackingIDs”). This would make the codebase easier to read and maintain.  

3. **Stricter Checks and Early Returns**  
   - The code has multiple `if` conditions checking for “mediaSource” or “campaign” presence. Early returns on invalid states helps keep the code structure simpler.  

4. **Naming Conventions**  
   - Some local variables could be renamed for clarity (e.g., generic “t” and “e” rename to “urlParams”, “defaultValues”, etc.).  

5. **Logging Consistency**  
   - Consider using a consistent logging strategy. The code mixes calls like `console.debug` and `console.error`. A dedicated log utility can streamline error handling.  

6. **Testing**  
   - Introducing robust test coverage, especially around skip lists, parameter merges, and local storage behaviour, would reduce edge case issues.  

> **Note**: Tealium iQ requires ES5 compatibility, so advanced JavaScript features (such as `let`, `const`, arrow functions, or template literals) should be avoided.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ownership**: Ideally owned by a developer or team familiar with AppsFlyer, marketing tags, and internal business requirements for tracking.  
- **Regular Testing**:  
  - Validate that stored parameters do not expire incorrectly, and that skip lists are updated properly when domains or referrers change.  
  - Ensure that the QR code is correctly generated after any major code changes.  
- **Version Control**:  
  - Keep this script under version control outside of Tealium iQ (e.g., in a Git repository).  
  - Tag or label updates in Tealium to track changes.  
- **Performance**:  
  - Monitor page load performance due to the large embedding of the QR code library. Consider loading the QR code part only when needed.  

In summary, this extension is a comprehensive solution for capturing incoming marketing parameters, building AppsFlyer tracking URLs, and generating QR codes. For ongoing success, keep your skip lists and parameter mappings up to date, test thoroughly, and remain mindful of local storage constraints.
