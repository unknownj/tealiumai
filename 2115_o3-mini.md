# Appsflyer: SmartScript Extension Documentation

This document describes the Tealium iQ Advanced Javascript Code extension used for generating Appsflyer OneLink/Direct Click URLs, processing tracking parameters and rendering QR codes. It covers an overview, code explanation, usage examples, known limitations, recommendations for refactoring and further maintenance notes.

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name**: Appsflyer : SmartScript  
- **ID**: 2115  
- **Extension Type**: Advanced Javascript Code  
- **Scope**: DOM Ready  
- **Occurrence**: Run Once  

**Summary**:  
This extension is designed to process tracking parameters, generate OneLink URLs and Direct Click URLs for Appsflyer campaigns and applications, and optionally render a QR code. It collects query string parameters (such as media source, campaign, sub-campaigns, etc.), validates and maps them, saves information in local storage, and further uses the referrer value if available. In addition, it uses a custom QR code library to create a visual representation of the URL. This helps the marketing and development teams to track mobile and web campaigns accurately.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables and Constants

- **AF_URL_SCHEME**: A regular expression string that validates the OneLink URL scheme.  
- **VALID_AF_URL_PARTS_LENGTH**: Defines the expected number of matches when validating a OneLink URL.  
- **Identifiers for tracking parameters**: Variables such as `GOOGLE_CLICK_ID`, `FACEBOOK_CLICK_ID`, `GBRAID`, `WBRAID` are defined to capture the tracking IDs from query strings.

### Data Processing and Flow

1. **Condition Checks**:  
   The extension begins by checking conditions based on the canonical domain. The JSON snippet at the top shows a list of conditions that apply when the domain value matches one of the provided values (for example, *www.lloydsbank.com*, *www.halifax.co.uk*, etc.).

2. **Utility Methods for Parameter Handling**:  
   - Functions such as `getQueryParamsAndSaveToLocalStorage` and `removeExpiredLocalStorageItems` parse the current URL and store parameters in local storage.  
   - Other helper methods include `getParameterValue`, `validateAndMappedParams`, and `processTrackingParameters` which obtain and format the query string values for constructing the final URL.

3. **URL Generation and Validation**:  
   - The function `isOneLinkURLValid` checks if the provided Appsflyer OneLink URL follows the expected scheme and format.  
   - Depending on the available parameters and whether the referrer and URL skip lists pass the defined checks (using `isSkippedURL` and `isSkipListsValid`), the extension builds the final OneLink URL by merging query string parameters using the `stringifyParameters` function.
   - For Direct Click URLs, additional validations include checking for platform support with `isPlatformValid` and ensuring that mandatory values such as `app_id`, `campaign`, and `redirectURL` are provided.

4. **QR Code Rendering**:  
   - Integrated QR code functionality (through the QRCode library) renders a QR image from the generated OneLink URL.  
   - The display method `window.AF_SMART_SCRIPT.displayQrCode` is set up to allow rendering through a user-specified container element, including optional parameters like logo and code colour.

5. **Global Dependencies**:  
   The implementation depends on several global objects and browser APIs:  
   - `window`, `document`, and `navigator` for accessing the referrer URL and current URL.  
   - `localStorage` for persisting incoming parameters and web referrer data.  
   - A QRCode library that is integrated into the extension code, which must work in an ES5 environment.
   - Usage of `console.debug` and `console.error` to log debugging and error information during execution.

6. **Impression Tracking**:  
   - The helper function `createImpressionsLink` asynchronously obtains an impressions link for tracking. If successful, a helper function `window.AF_SMART_SCRIPT.fireImpressionsLink` is created to fire the impression event by loading an image (1x1 pixel) in the background.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Normal Flow for OneLink URL Generation

- **Input**:  
  A valid OneLink URL is provided along with tracking parameters such as `mediaSource`, `campaign` and optional custom parameters.  
  The referrer and URL skip lists pass validation.

- **Processing**:  
  1. The utility functions extract query parameters from the current URL and save them to local storage.
  2. The extension validates that the OneLink URL is correct using the regex pattern.
  3. It maps the tracking parameters by calling `validateAndMappedParams` and then merges them using `stringifyParameters`.
  4. Additional tracking parameters (like `gclid`, `fbclid`, etc.) are appended by `processTrackingParameters`.
  5. A final URL is generated and stored in the object returned by `AF_SMART_SCRIPT.generateOneLinkURL`.

- **Output**:  
  A valid clickURL is available on the returned object and (if required) a QR code can be generated using the helper `AF_SMART_SCRIPT.displayQrCode`.

### Scenario 2: Direct Click URL Generation for Mobile Platforms

- **Input**:  
  The extension receives values for `afParameters`, a platform (e.g. `"ios"` or `"android"`), `app_id` and `redirectURL`.  
  All parameters pass the required validations.

- **Processing**:  
  1. The function `generateDirectClickURL` validates provided values and checks for required tracking parameters.
  2. Depending on the mobile platform, it adjusts parameters (for example, replacing parameter keys for iOS/Android environments).
  3. Similar to OneLink URL flow, query parameters are merged and processed.

- **Output**:  
  A correctly formatted Direct Click URL is returned, which is then used to redirect or track a click action.

### Scenario 3: Edge Case Handling

- **Edge Case**:  
  The extension does not generate a URL when:
  - The OneLink URL fails validation.
  - Mandatory parameters such as `mediaSource` or `campaign` are missing.
  - The URL or referrer contains skip parameters (as defined by the user).
  
- **Outcome**:  
  Appropriate console errors are logged (e.g. "mediaSource is missing") and `null` is returned to indicate failure.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **URL Validation Failures**:  
  If the OneLink URL does not match the expected regular expression pattern (or if the parts are missing), the function `isOneLinkURLValid` returns false. This prevents further processing and generation of the clickable URL.

- **Local Storage Dependency**:  
  The extension uses local storage to persist incoming parameters and the web referrer. If local storage is disabled or full, the extension may fail to store or retrieve information correctly.

- **Global Object Dependencies**:  
  Since the extension utilises global objects (like `window`, `document`, and `navigator`), any external script that overrides or modifies these objects might cause unexpected issues.

- **Conflict with Other Extensions**:  
  There is potential for conflicts if multiple Tealium extensions attempt to manipulate similar URL parameters or write to the same local storage keys (for example, `ss_incoming_params` or `ss_webReferrer`).

- **QR Code Library Complexity**:  
  The integrated QRCode library is extensive and supports many options. Some customization in the QR code rendering (such as additional scaling or styles) may require advanced knowledge of the library.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks & Input Validation**:  
  Although the code assumes that `eventType` (string) and `eventPayload` (object) are always provided, additional validations should be placed when processing query parameters to avoid issues if unexpected values (like null or undefined) are encountered.

- **Code Style and Modularity**:  
  • Consider breaking the large file into smaller modules or separate helper files based on functionality (e.g. URL processing, QR code generation, local storage handling).  
  • Maintain comments explaining the purpose of each major function block for readability.  
  • Use meaningful variable names consistently (avoiding single-letter names where possible) to improve code clarity.  
  • Ensure consistent error logging and debugging messages.

- **Handling Global Namespace Pollution**:  
  Encapsulate global variables and functions (such as those attached to `window.AF_SMART_SCRIPT`) within an IIFE or a defined namespace to avoid potential conflicts with other scripts on the page.

- **ES5 Compliance and Best Practices**:  
  Since ES5 is required, continue to use traditional function declarations and avoid ES6 constructs such as arrow functions, template literals, or block-scoped variables (`let`/`const`).

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance**:  
  • Establish automated tests to validate URL generation under various parameter configurations.  
  • Monitor the browser console for errors or warnings after deployment to catch unexpected behaviours.  
  • Keep track of any updates in the Appsflyer OneLink specifications or required parameters that may necessitate changes in parameter mapping logic.

- **Ownership and Documentation**:  
  • Assign a developer or team responsible for this extension to ensure prompt updates and maintenance.  
  • Maintain an internal changelog or version history to track modifications and bug fixes.

- **Testing Guidelines**:  
  • Test the extension in multiple browsers (keeping in mind ES5 support) and on various devices to ensure proper operation of URL generation and QR code rendering.  
  • Verify the behaviour under both typical and edge-case scenarios (e.g. missing parameters, unexpected URL formats, local storage quota exceeded).  
  • Validate proper integration with other Tealium extensions by ensuring that shared resources (e.g. local storage keys) do not conflict.

- **Further Development & Integration**:  
  If future projects require additional features (such as more complex tracking or dynamic parameter adjustments based on user behaviour), consider abstracting the URL generation logic into a separate service. This can simplify future enhancements and integration with other systems.
