# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: Appsflyer Persist App Open Flag

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name**: Appsflyer persist app open flag
- **ID**: 2117
- **Type**: Persist Data Value
- **Scope**: 1459
- **Execution Frequency**: On every relevant event trigger

### Summary
The "Appsflyer persist app open flag" extension is designed to track whether or not an app has been opened by a user. This is determined by setting a flag (`AppOpenedFlag`) to either `"Y"` (yes) or `"N"` (no) based on the presence of a specific condition. The extension helps in mapping user engagement with the application, providing valuable insights for marketing and analytics purposes.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- `flg`: A variable that holds the value to be set for the `AppOpenedFlag` (either `"Y"` or `"N"`).
- `b`: A reference to the global object where the flag is stored.
- `utag`: The Tealium standard object used to manage tags and data layer operations.
- `clova3`: An external or global object used to manipulate a data layer.

### Logic Flow
1. The extension immediately checks if the global object `b` contains a property named `cp.utag_main__aaof`. 
2. If the property exists, the `setOpen` function is invoked with the value `"N"`, indicating that the app has not been opened in the current session.
3. If the property does not exist, it assumes the app is being opened for the first time, setting the flag to `"Y"`.
4. The `setOpen` function updates three separate places:
   - `b["AppOpenedFlag"]`: Directly stored in the global object.
   - `utag.data.AppOpenedFlag`: Updated within the Tealium's data layer.
   - `clova3.datalayer`: Another layer where the flag is set, suggesting integration with additional data management practices.

### Dependencies
- **Global Objects**: The code interacts with global objects like `b`, `utag`, and `clova3`, which should be accessible in the context where this extension runs.
- **Tealium Libraries**: It is assumed that Tealium's libraries are already loaded and available when this extension executes.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Conditions
- When a user opens the app for the first time in a session:
  - The extension will set `AppOpenedFlag` to `"Y"` and notify all relevant layers.
  
- If the user navigates back to the app while it's already open:
  - The extension checks for the existence of `cp.utag_main__aaof`, leading to setting `AppOpenedFlag` to `"N"`.

### Edge Conditions
- **Scenario 1**: If `cp.utag_main__aaof` is unexpectedly removed from global scope or not available:
  - The extension will incorrectly set `AppOpenedFlag` to `"Y"` every time, indicating a false app open event.
  
- **Scenario 2**: If multiple concurrent instances of the app make conflicting updates to the `AppOpenedFlag`:
  - This could lead to unpredictable results, where subsequent events within the same session may not reflect actual user engagement.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Dependency on Global State**: The extension relies on the presence of global objects (`b`, `utag`, `clova3`), which if not properly set up, can cause runtime errors.
- **Concurrency Issues**: In scenarios where multiple instances of the app are interacting simultaneously, the flag may not provide an accurate state, potentially leading to data integrity issues.
- **Scope Limit**: The extension might only function correctly under specific operational contexts or user journeys mapped in Tealium.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks**: Introduce checks to ensure `b`, `utag`, and `clova3` are defined before attempting to set values. Although you do not need checks for `eventType` and `eventPayload`, it's still good practice for other dependencies.
  
- **Modularisation**: Consider separating the flag setting into distinct, testable functions. This would improve readability and facilitate unit testing.
  
- **Clarity in Naming**: Using more descriptive variable names (instead of `flg`) would enhance code clarity and maintainability. 

- **Comments**: Adding inline comments explaining each logical block of the code would help future developers understand the purpose without needing to decipher the whole function.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ownership**: Establish a clear owner for this extension who is responsible for updates and adjustments as needed.
- **Testing Guidelines**: Implement thorough testing protocols, especially around conditions where the application state changes.
- **Version Control**: Use version control for tracking changes to the extension and ensure changes are documented in associated commit messages for future reference.
