# AppsFlyer App Open Flag Extension Documentation

This document covers the details of the AppsFlyer App Open Flag Tealium iQ extension. It is intended to serve as a comprehensive reference for developers and stakeholders.

---

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** AppsFlyer App Open Flag  
- **ID:** 2116  
- **Extension Type:** Advanced Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** 1459  
- **Execution Frequency:**  
  - Runs each time the associated event(s) are fired during the Tealium tag execution cycle.

**Summary:**  
This extension evaluates whether a particular condition, represented by the global Tealium data layer variable `cp.utag_main__aaof`, is present. Based on its presence, it sets an "AppOpenedFlag" in multiple data repositories (i.e. the local event data payload, the universal Tealium data layer, and an external library’s datalayer) to either "Y" (Yes) or "N" (No). This flag is likely used to ensure that an app-open event is only processed once or to accurately record app opening events for further data analysis or marketing efforts.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables and Functions

- **Global Parameters:**  
  - `eventType`: Although not used directly in the code, this parameter is passed into the function.
  - `eventPayload` (referenced as `b`): Represents the event data object; used to store or check flag values.
  - `tagObject` (referenced as `u`): Not directly used in the provided logic.

- **Function `setOpen(flg)`:**  
  - **Purpose:** Sets the "AppOpenedFlag" value in various data repositories.
  - **Parameters:**  
    - `flg`: A string value ("Y" for Yes or "N" for No) that determines the flag status.
  - **Actions:**  
    1. Sets the property "AppOpenedFlag" on `eventPayload` (variable `b`).
    2. Sets the same flag into `utag.data` (universal Tealium data layer).
    3. Invokes a method on the `clova3.datalayer` object to update this flag, ensuring the update is applied immediately (the third parameter `true`).

### Logic Flow

1. **Condition Check:**  
   - The code checks if `eventPayload["cp.utag_main__aaof"]` exists and has a truthy value.  
   - If the condition is met, it calls `setOpen("N")` meaning an app open is not considered (or already processed) as indicated by "N".

2. **Else Statement:**  
   - If the condition is not met, it calls `setOpen("Y")` meaning the app open should be flagged as a new open event.

### Dependencies on Global Objects or Libraries

- **utag.data:**  
  - Assumes the existence of the universal Tealium data layer object where additional data properties are pushed.
- **clova3.datalayer:**  
  - Assumes a custom/global library exists with a method `set` which takes three parameters: the key, the value, and a boolean flag (possibly forcing an immediate update).
- **eventPayload (`b`):**  
  - Expected to always be present as part of Tealium’s standard event parameters.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Example 1: Standard Scenario

**Scenario:**  
A typical event is fired without the variable `cp.utag_main__aaof` in `eventPayload`.

**Data Flow:**  
1. The condition `if (b["cp.utag_main__aaof"])` is evaluated as false.  
2. The function `setOpen("Y")` is executed.  
3. "AppOpenedFlag" is set to "Y" in:
   - The event's data payload (`eventPayload["AppOpenedFlag"] = "Y"`),
   - Tealium’s global `utag.data` object,
   - The external `clova3.datalayer`.

**Outcome:**  
The app open event is correctly identified as a new open.

---

### Example 2: Conditional Scenario

**Scenario:**  
An event is fired with the variable `cp.utag_main__aaof` present in the eventPayload.

**Data Flow:**  
1. The condition `if (b["cp.utag_main__aaof"])` is evaluated as true.
2. The function `setOpen("N")` is executed.
3. "AppOpenedFlag" is set to "N" in all the respective data containers.

**Outcome:**  
The flag indicates the app has already opened (or should not be considered a new app open), preventing duplicate processing.

---

### Edge Conditions

- **Missing Libraries:**  
  - If `clova3.datalayer` is not available or its method `set` fails, the code may still work partially as it sets the flag in `eventPayload` and `utag.data`.
- **Non-Boolean Truthy Values:**  
  - Any non-falsey value present in `eventPayload["cp.utag_main__aaof"]` will trigger the conditional path regardless of its exact type.

---

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Global Object Dependencies:**  
  - The extension relies on external/global objects (`utag.data`, `clova3.datalayer`) which, if reconfigured or missing, could result in incomplete flag propagation.

- **Condition Sensitivity:**  
  - The condition `if (b["cp.utag_main__aaof"])` is lenient. Any truthy value (e.g. non-empty strings, numbers other than 0) will result in the flag being set to "N", which may not always be semantically correct.

- **Inter-Extension Conflicts:**  
  - If another Tealium extension modifies the same flags or data layer values (specifically `AppOpenedFlag`), the logic here might be inadvertently overridden.
  - External scripts or libraries that manipulate `utag.data` or `clova3.datalayer` may conflict if they have overlapping responsibilities.

---

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Coding:**  
  - Although checks for the availability of `eventType` and `eventPayload` are not necessary, consider verifying the existence of dependent global objects (`utag.data` and `clova3.datalayer`), thereby adding error logging or fallbacks in production environments.

- **Code Style & Modularity:**  
  - Maintain consistency in naming conventions (note the mixed use of abbreviated variable names such as `b` for `eventPayload` can be less readable).
  - Clearly comment each logical block for improved maintainability.
  - Refactor the logic into smaller helper functions if further logic is expected to be added in the future.

- **Explicit Condition Handling:**  
  - Consider normalising the value retrieved from `eventPayload["cp.utag_main__aaof"]` explicitly (for example, comparing against a specific value) to avoid ambiguity in determining truthy/falsy values.

- **Documentation and Testing:**  
  - Ensure that changes to the global objects used in the extension are reflected in the test cases.
  - Maintain a test suite to capture different data configurations that trigger each branch of the logic.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**
  - Clearly assign ownership for this extension, including a point of contact for when dependencies like `clova3.datalayer` are updated.
  - Periodically review dependency availability (i.e. `utag.data` and `clova3.datalayer`) especially following updates to the Tealium platform or integrations.

- **Testing Guidelines:**
  - Develop unit tests that simulate various event payload configurations to ensure that the flag is set as expected under different conditions.
  - Integration tests should confirm that downstream systems dependent on the "AppOpenedFlag" value (e.g. reporting systems or subsequent tag triggers) are receiving the correct data.

- **Version Control & Comments:**
  - Tag changes with version comments in the code to track modifications over time.
  - Leverage inline comments to explain the rationale behind the choice of flag values ("Y" vs "N") and any business rules associated with this decision.
