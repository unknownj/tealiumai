# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Hide Smart Banner on SW Referral
- **ID:** 2118
- **Type:** Javascript Code
- **Scope:** Pre Loader
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Once

### Summary
This extension is designed to hide the smart banner on pages that are accessed via the SW (Service Worker) referral by examining the URL query parameters. If the URL contains the string `swappwebview`, the extension creates a `<style>` element and appends CSS to hide the smart banner. This enhancement is aimed at improving user experience by preventing unwanted UI elements from displaying in specific contexts.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- `ss`: This variable is used to create a new `<style>` element, which holds the CSS rules for hiding the smart banner.

### Logic Flow
1. The code is wrapped in an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) to avoid polluting the global scope.
2. A `try-catch` block is used to capture any potential errors during execution. If any errors occur, they are ignored (no harm done).
3. The code checks if the `window.location.search` is a string and contains the substring `"swappwebview"`. If this condition is met, the style for hiding the smart banner is defined.
4. The style is then appended to the document's head, effectively applying the hiding rule.

### Dependencies
- **Global Objects:** The extension relies on the following global objects:
  - `window`: To access the current URL and its query parameters.
  - `document`: To manipulate the DOM by creating and appending the style element.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Conditions
- When a user accesses a page with the URL `http://example.com?swappwebview=true`, the extension executes successfully:
  - The smart banner will be hidden from the page due to the appended CSS rule.

### Edge Conditions
- If the URL does not contain the `swappwebview` string, the extension does not modify the DOM:
  - Example: Accessing `http://example.com?someotherparam=true` will leave the smart banner visible.
- If there is an execution error (e.g., a problem with appending the style tag), it is silently ignored, ensuring no disruption in the page functionality.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- The extension will not function if JavaScript is disabled in the userâ€™s browser.
- If multiple extensions modify the same style for the smart banner, conflicts may arise leading to unexpected UI behaviour.
- The extension is dependent on the structure of the webpage to be inline with standard practices for `<style>` tag placement. If the structure of the target site differs significantly, the CSS may not apply as intended.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks:** Although not required for `eventType` or `eventPayload`, it is a good practice to ensure any future variables or methods are robustly checked to prevent issues.
- **Code Style:** Consider using consistent naming conventions and comments throughout the code to enhance readability.
- **Modularization:** Future enhancements could benefit from modularising similar functionalities into separate functions, particularly if additional conditions are to be checked or more styles are to be applied based on varying criteria.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:** Perform periodic reviews of the extension to ensure its functionality aligns with website updates and user behaviour.
- **Ownership:** Assign a development lead to oversee this extension and handle any potential updates or required modifications.
- **Testing Guidelines:** Comprehensive testing should be conducted when deploying updates to validate that the smart banner behaves as expected across different user scenarios and device types, especially in cases of referrer URLs.
