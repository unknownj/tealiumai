# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation

This document provides a detailed overview of the "Hide Smart Banner on SW Referral" extension for Tealium iQ. It covers the extension's purpose, logic, usage scenarios, limitations, recommendations, and maintenance guidelines.

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Hide Smart Banner on SW Referral  
- **ID:** 2118  
- **Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** Pre Loader  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Once  

### Summary

The extension is designed to detect if the current URL request contains the query parameter "swappwebview". If the parameter is found, it injects a style element into the document's head to hide elements with the class "smartbanner" by applying a CSS rule that sets `display: none !important`. This ensures that the smart banner is hidden on pages accessed via specific referral conditions that include the "swappwebview" query string.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables & Elements

- **window.location.search:**  
  Checks if the query string of the URL is a string and then converts it to lowercase for a case-insensitive check.

- **ss (Style Element):**  
  A new `<style>` element that is created for injecting CSS rules if the specified condition is met. The rule added is `.smartbanner { display: none !important }`.

### Logic Flow

1. **Immediate Invocation:**  
   The extension code is wrapped in an anonymous function that is immediately executed. This is to ensure that the logic runs as soon as the code is loaded.

2. **Error Handling:**  
   A try/catch block is used so that any exception or error in the extension fails gracefully without affecting the remainder of the Tealium implementation.

3. **URL Query Check:**  
   - The code first confirms if `window.location.search` is a string.
   - It then converts the search string to lowercase and checks if it contains the substring "swappwebview".

4. **Style Injection:**  
   - If the condition is met, a new `<style>` element is created.
   - The innerText of the style element is set to `.smartbanner { display: none !important }` to force hide the smart banner.
   - The style element is appended to the document’s `<head>` section.

### Dependencies

- **Global Objects:**  
  - `window.location` is used to retrieve the URL's query parameters.
  - `document.createElement` and `document.head.appendChild` are used to manipulate the DOM.
  
This extension does not depend on any external libraries and uses only standard ES5-compatible JavaScript.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Normal Condition

- **Input/Environment:**  
  A user accesses a webpage with a URL containing `?swappwebview=1` (case-insensitive).

- **Process:**  
  The extension detects the "swappwebview" within the query string. It then creates and appends a `<style>` element that hides any element with the class "smartbanner".

- **Outcome:**  
  The smart banner will not be visible on the webpage.

### Scenario 2: Edge Condition (URL Without the Parameter)

- **Input/Environment:**  
  A user accesses the webpage without the query parameter "swappwebview" (e.g., `?ref=other`).

- **Process:**  
  The extension checks the URL, does not find the "swappwebview" substring, and therefore does not execute the style injection code.

- **Outcome:**  
  The smart banner remains visible as no modifications are made.

### Scenario 3: Case-Insensitive Matching

- **Input/Environment:**  
  A user accesses a webpage with URL containing mixed case query such as `?SwAppWebView=true`.

- **Process:**  
  The extension converts the query string to lower case and identifies "swappwebview" within it, triggering the style injection.

- **Outcome:**  
  The smart banner is hidden as expected.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Query String Dependency:**  
  The extension strictly relies on detecting the string "swappwebview" in the URL query. If the query parameter changes its naming or format, the extension will not function as intended.

- **Global Namespace:**  
  While the code itself is contained within an immediately invoked function, any errors outside the try/catch (or potential future modifications) might conflict with other scripts modifying the DOM.

- **CSS Specificity:**  
  The injected CSS rule uses `!important` to override any existing styles. This might lead to conflicts if other scripts or style elements (loaded later) attempt to re-display the smart banner.

- **Performance:**  
  The extension runs on "Pre Loader" and "Run Once", which is efficient for this use case. However, if similar methods are used extensively across a site, performance could be impacted.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks:**  
  Continue using defensive coding practices as implemented with the try/catch block. Although errors are caught quietly, it might be useful to log any exceptions during development.
  
- **Code Modularisation:**  
  If more similar actions need to be taken based on URL parameters in the future, consider modularising the logic (e.g., separate functions for query parsing, DOM manipulation, etc.) to enhance maintainability.

- **Explicit URL Parameter Parsing:**  
  For clarity and potential future expansion, consider using a utility function to parse URL query parameters, rather than directly operating on the search string. (Ensure any new implementation is ES5-compatible.)

- **Documentation in Code:**  
  Add inline comments explaining the purpose of each block of code. This is particularly useful for developers new to the project.

- **Testing:**  
  Include unit tests for the function that checks the query string and injects the style. Even though the extension runs as "Run Once," having tests can safeguard against regressions during future modifications.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  - Regularly review browser compatibility and potential Tealium iQ platform updates.
  - Audit the injected CSS rules to ensure they remain appropriate as site styles evolve.

- **Ownership:**  
  Clearly document the ownership and revision history of this extension. A versioning comment block at the top of the extension file could be useful for tracking changes.

- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Test across multiple devices and browsers to ensure consistent behaviour.
  - Monitor for any changes in Tealium iQ's execution model that might impact extensions running in the "Pre Loader" scope.
  - Validate that the smart banner remains hidden when expected, and that no unintended side effects occur on pages without the "swappwebview" query parameter.

- **Further Enhancements:**  
  Consider building a more robust logging mechanism during development that could be disabled in production. This ensures that any unexpected behaviours can be traced without affecting user experience.
