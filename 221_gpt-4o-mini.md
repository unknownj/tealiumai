# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: Detect Brand and Environment 

## 1. Extension Overview
- **Name**: Detect brand and environment
- **ID**: 100036
- **Type**: Javascript Code
- **Scope**: Before Load Rules
- **Execution Frequency**: Run Always

**Summary**:  
This extension is designed to identify the brand and environment of a website based on the domain and path information. It enables data layers to specify the current brand (e.g., Lloyds, Halifax) and environment (e.g., online, apply, secure) in Tealium, facilitating accurate data tracking and analytics across different brands and site environments.

## 2. Code Explanation 

### Key Variables
- **`utag.data`**: A global object used to store various pieces of information which will be accessible in the Tealium data layer.
- **`current_brand`**: A dynamic property that captures the brand based on the domain.
- **`current_environment`**: A dynamic property that captures the environment based on the domain structure.

### Logic Flow
1. **Brand Detection**: 
   - The script first checks if the domain belongs to predefined test sites (e.g., "digital.lloydsbank", "intranet.test").
   - It then assigns the `current_brand` based on specific substrings present in the domain.

2. **Environment Detection**:
   - After determining the brand, the script sets the `current_environment` depending on specific conditions derived from the domain's structure (e.g., "p-online", "p-apply").

3. **Fallback Checks**:
   - If `current_brand` is undefined, the script attempts to extract brand information from a global `clova3` object if it exists.
   - Further checks are performed for the brand based on additional domains.

4. **User Agent Detection**:
   - The script also detects whether the user is on a mobile device or a tablet using regular expression tests against the user agent string.

### Dependencies
- **`window.clova3`**: A global object for accessing the `datalayer`, contains methods to retrieve brand and environment data.
- **`navigator.userAgent`**: Used for detecting device types (mobile or tablet).

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Scenario
- When visiting `www.halifax.co.uk`, the extension will parse the domain, identify the brand as "halifax", and set the environment to "www".

### Edge Conditions
- For the domain `digital.lloydsbank-test.dlp`, it detects the brand as "lloyds" and environment as "www".
- For an unrecognized domain like `www.unknownbrand.com`, it defaults the brand to "lloyds".

### Combining Data
- If a visitor comes from `www.scottishwidowsyourfutureself.co.uk`, the extension sets both `current_brand` to "scottishwidows" and checks for the environment structure.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- The extension can miss edge cases where custom subdomains are introduced that do not fit the current logic.
- If the `clova3` object is not defined, fallback detection for brand and environment will not occur, possibly leading to errors or undefined values.
- This extension does not handle multiple brands being in use simultaneously on different parts of the site.
- Conflicts may arise with other extensions that manipulate `utag.data`, especially those altering the same keys (e.g., `current_brand` or `current_environment`). 

---

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks**: Introduce checks on the format of the domain before processing to ensure it adheres to expected patterns, thereby preventing runtime errors.
- **Modularisation**: Break parts of the logic into smaller functions for easier testing and maintenance, e.g., separate functions for brand detection and environment detection.
- **Comments and Documentation**: Enhance inline documentation in the code for clarity, especially around complex condition checks.
- **Consistency**: Maintain consistent key naming conventions (`current_brand`, `current_environment`, etc.) across the codebase to reduce confusion.

---

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ownership**: Assign a dedicated developer or team responsible for updates and bug fixes related to this extension.
- **Testing Guidelines**: Establish a testing protocol that includes different domain conditions (test, live, and edge cases) to ensure all scenarios are accounted for.
- **Review Periodicity**: Regularly review the extension for relevance against evolving requirements and domains being utilized by the brands it supports.
