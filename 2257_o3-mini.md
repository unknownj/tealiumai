# Pegasus V2 : MAU functions Extension Documentation

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Pegasus V2 : MAU functions  
- **ID:** 2257 (Extension), 100040 (Extension Id)  
- **Type:** Advanced Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** 1611  
- **Execution Frequency:** Runs on each page load when the extension is triggered (via the lookup table provided in the payload)  

**Summary:**  
This extension handles the triggering of Microsoft Advertising Universal Event Tracking (MAU) events based on specific lookup table conditions. It processes event payloads from Tealium iQ by evaluating eligibility rules and then either immediately or with a delay (or on an event listener) invokes the MAU event tracking function. Essentially, its goal is to push conversion events with the proper parameters to a global tracking queue (window.uetq) for use in attribution and analytics.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables & Parameters

- **Input Parameters:**  
  - `eventType` (passed as `a`): The type of event that has occurred.  
  - `eventPayload` (passed as `b`): An object containing multiple values used throughout the extension.  
  - `tagObject` (passed as `u`): Additional tag configuration details (currently not used extensively in the code).

- **Global Variables:**  
  - `window.uetq`: A global array used for pushing MAU tracking events.  
  - `LBGAnalytics`: A global library object (presumed) for DOM event handling.
  - `b.lookupTable`: An array holding lookup records that the extension iterates over to determine if a tag should fire.
  - `b.structureLkps`: A lookup object used for mapping tag properties to their corresponding values.

### Logic Flow Overview

1. **Event Dispatching with `mau_event(ev)`:**  
   - Receives an event lowercase string identifier (e.g. 'purchase', 'view_item').  
   - Sets conversion parameters (`ord`, `value`, and `label`) based on the event type.  
   - Pushes an object with keys like "revenue_value", "event_value", "event_category", "event_label", and "transaction_id" to the `window.uetq` array. This allows the MAU event to be tracked.

2. **Data Parsing Functions:**  
   - **`unpackStr(TagValues, delim)`:**  
     Splits a delimited string (using the provided delimiter) into an array.  
   - **`unpackTag(arr)`:**  
     Splits a custom object (designed with an array containing two strings), returning the input string and the output string.
   - **`createElig(arr)`:**  
     Takes an array (obtained from a delimited input) and maps it to an object using a corresponding lookup table (`b.structureLkps`). Returns an eligibility rules array and a trigger string.
   - **`findTag(currentTag)`:**  
     Checks if a given tag string (delimited with '!') corresponds to the expected MAU tag by verifying the first element.

3. **Conditional Trigger Handling (`setTags(ev, trigger)`):**  
   - Determines when to run the MAU event based on the trigger parameter:
     - **Page Trigger:** Immediate execution.
     - **Timed Trigger:** Delayed execution based on a timeout value specified in the trigger (e.g. "Timed:2000").  
     - **Event Trigger:** Sets up event listeners on specified DOM elements that fire the event when conditions are met. This may include filtering based on the text content of the triggered element.

4. **Eligibility and Tag Processing (`runLookups(currentArr)`):**  
   - Unpacks the lookup table record into two parts (eligibility rules and tag configuration).  
   - Uses `unpackStr` to deconstruct the strings into arrays.
   - Searches for MAU-related tag information among all provided tag IDs.
   - Validates all eligibility rules using an external function (`clova3.Q`). If all rules pass, it triggers the MAU event using `setTags`.

5. **Execution:**  
   - The code iterates over the `b.lookupTable` array and applies the `runLookups()` function to evaluate each record.

### Dependencies and Global Objects

- **Global Tracking Queue:**  
  Uses a global array `window.uetq` for pushing event details.

- **Lookup Data Structures:**  
  Relies on properties such as `b.lookupTable` and `b.structureLkps` to acquire campaign/tag eligibility information as well as tag parameters.

- **LBGAnalytics Library:**  
  Utilised for binding event listeners to DOM elements (used to capture click or similar events).

- **clova3.Q Function:**  
  An external function (presumably provided elsewhere) that validates each eligibility rule.

- **Assumptions:**  
  The extension assumes that `eventType` (a), `eventPayload` (b), and `tagObject` (u) are pre-set and available. The code also presumes the existence and correct structure of `LBGAnalytics` and `clova3`.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Purchase Event

**Data Flow:**
- `eventType` is passed alongside an `eventPayload` that contains keys such as `paid_order_id`, `JourneyAmount`, `JourneyName`, `JourneyProduct`, and `PegasusTagName`.
- The lookup table record unpacks and verifies eligibility.
- Upon meeting all eligibility criteria, the extension calls `mau_event('purchase')`.  
  - For a 'purchase' event, the event parameters are extracted:
    - `ord` is set to `b.paid_order_id`
    - `value` is set to `b.JourneyAmount`
    - `label` is composed as `b.JourneyName` + "|" + `b.JourneyProduct`
- The event details are then pushed to `window.uetq` to mark the conversion.

### Scenario 2: View Item Event

**Data Flow:**
- For a `view_item` event, the event payload carries relevant keys.
- Inside `mau_event('view_item')`:
  - `label` is assigned from `b.CanonicalURL`.
  - `ord` is set to 1.
  - `value` is set to 0.
- The tracking event is then queued immediately.

### Edge Condition: Event Trigger with Delayed Action

**Data Flow:**
- A trigger defined as triggering on a DOM event may include a delayed execution or filtering. The trigger string might be in the format "Event:divID:eventType" or include a filter condition "Event:divID:eventType:buttonText".  
- The code binds the event listener using the LBGAnalytics library:
  - If the event listener triggers and, in the case of the filter condition, the element’s text matches, `mau_event(ev)` is executed.
- If the trigger is a delayed event (e.g. "Timed:2000"), the code sets a timeout before firing the MAU event.
  
These examples help illustrate normal flows and also how the extension defers execution depending on the specified trigger type.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Dependency on Global Objects:**  
  The extension relies on externally defined objects (`LBGAnalytics`, `clova3`, `window.uetq`) and properties (`lookupTable`, `structureLkps`). If these are absent or not correctly set up, the extension may fail or cause runtime errors.

- **Eligibility Rule Evaluation:**  
  The use of `eligArr.every(clova3.Q)` assumes that each eligibility rule is correctly formatted and that `clova3.Q` correctly validates conditions. Incorrect implementation of `clova3.Q` or malformation in eligibility criteria may prevent the event from firing.

- **DOM Element Selection:**  
  When triggering events based on DOM events (clicks, etc.), any issues with element selection (e.g. element not found or multiple matches) may cause the event listener not to bind, leading to missed conversion tracking.

- **Redundant Operations:**  
  The function `findTag` calls `unpackStr` redundantly. Improvements could be made, but caution is needed due to ES5 support restrictions.

- **Debug Logging:**  
  The console.log statements used for debugging might cause clutter in the console output in a production environment.

- **Trigger Parsing:**  
  Improper formatting of trigger strings in the lookup table (e.g. missing delimiters or unexpected values) may result in runtime errors or the event not firing.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks:**  
  While the availability of `eventType` and `eventPayload` is guaranteed, adding checks for the existence and structure of objects like `b.lookupTable`, `b.structureLkps`, and `LBGAnalytics` could improve robustness (within ES5 constraints).

- **Modularisation:**  
  Consider refactoring sections into smaller helper functions where possible. For example, the logic in `setTags` for different trigger types might be split into dedicated functions to make the code easier to maintain and test.

- **Code Clarity:**  
  Replace duplicated operations—for instance, the duplication of `unpackStr(currentTag, '!')` in `findTag`—with a single call saved to a local variable.

- **Error Handling:**  
  Improve error handling in the timeout (Timed triggers) and event listener functions by providing clearer messages or fallbacks.

- **Comments and Documentation:**  
  Continue to add inline comments explaining why certain values are used (e.g. why `ord` is set to 1 in non-purchase events) and document external dependencies.

- **ES5 Compliance:**  
  Keep in mind that all refactoring must preserve ES5 compatibility. Avoid using ES6 features like arrow functions, const/let, or template literals.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  - Ensure that any updates to the external objects (like `LBGAnalytics` or `clova3`) are compatible with this extension.  
  - Regularly review lookup configurations (`b.lookupTable` and `b.structureLkps`) to ensure they remain consistent with marketing requirements.

- **Ownership & Testing:**  
  - Assign a designated owner for the extension who will be responsible for addressing bugs and providing updates.  
  - Implement tests in a staging environment to simulate all trigger types (Page, Timed, and Event) before deploying changes in production.

- **Logging Practices:**  
  - Consider implementing a logging mechanism that can be easily toggled for debugging versus production use.  
  - Evaluate whether all console.log debugging statements are necessary in the production code or if they should be removed/reduced.

- **Documentation Updates:**  
  - Keep this documentation updated whenever there is a change in the lookup table schema, any of the global objects involved, or the logic used for trigger handling.
