# Onelink Appstore Redirect Extension Documentation

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Onelink Appstore Redirect  
- **ID:** 100036 (extensionId) / 2259 (Tealium internal id)  
- **Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** After Tag Extensions  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Once  

**Summary:**  
This extension detects when a user navigates to specific app download pages (e.g. lloydsbank.com/app.html, halifax.co.uk/app.html, etc.) and, based on the current device (Android, iPhone, iPad) and URL query parameters, dynamically generates an onelink URL to redirect users to the appropriate app store or update the "href" attributes of app store download buttons on the page. The one link URL is generated using a global smart script library (AF_SMART_SCRIPT) to incorporate campaign tracking parameters.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables & Objects

- **testLogging:**  
  A flag (currently set to false) that can be used to enable or disable logging during development. The commented check hints it could be toggled based on a query string parameter.

- **appStoreRedirect:**  
  A global object that contains the main functions and properties used for the redirection logic:
  
  - **onelinkURLs:**  
    An object mapping brand keys (e.g. “Lloyds”, “Halifax”, “BOS”, etc.) to their corresponding onelink URLs. These URLs are used as a base when generating the final campaign tracking URL.
  
  - **getBrand function:**  
    This function checks the user agent (and query parameters) to determine if the visitor is on a mobile device. It returns a string "y" if any condition (Android, iPhone, iPad, or forced via query parameters) is met. This function governs whether a redirect happens.
  
  - **onelink function:**  
    The core logic which:
    - Accepts a brand parameter (e.g., “Lloyds”, “Halifax”).
    - Retrieves the corresponding base onelink URL from `onelinkURLs`.
    - Defines campaign and custom parameters (media source, channel, campaign, afSub1, ad, etc.) using predefined keys and default values.
    - Invokes the global `window.AF_SMART_SCRIPT.generateOneLinkURL` function to generate the complete onelink URL (`AF_SMART_SCRIPT_RESULT`), which includes dynamic tracking parameters.
    - Identifies DOM elements (using `document.querySelectorAll`) for Android and Apple app store buttons. Depending on the brand (with special handling for “LloydsBusiness”), it updates the `href` attribute of these elements to point to the generated URL.
    - Finally, if the current device is confirmed as mobile and the brand is not “LloydsBusiness”, it performs an automatic redirect using `window.location.href`.

### Dependencies & Global Objects

- **window.AF_SMART_SCRIPT:**  
  This global object is used to generate the tracking URL through its `generateOneLinkURL` method. It must be available and correctly configured on the page for the extension to work.

- **DOM APIs:**  
  Uses standard DOM methods such as `querySelectorAll`, `parentNode`, and `setAttribute` to manipulate HTML elements. The code assumes a specific HTML structure (for example, the existence of parent elements to set the href).

- **User Agent & URL Inspection:**  
  Checks `window.navigator.userAgent` and `window.location.search` to detect device type and force certain behaviours (through specific query parameters like `forceandroid` or `forceapple`).

### Logic Flow

1. **Initial Setup:**  
   The `appStoreRedirect` object declares its available onelink URLs and helper functions.

2. **Mobile Device Detection:**  
   The `getBrand` function returns "y" if the user agent indicates a mobile device or if forced via query parameters.

3. **Generating the onelink URL:**  
   The `onelink` function constructs parameters for tracking and generates the URL by calling `window.AF_SMART_SCRIPT.generateOneLinkURL`.

4. **DOM Manipulation:**  
   The function searches for Android and Apple app store badge nodes using predefined data attributes. It then updates the `href` attributes of these nodes with the generated tracking URL, with specific handling based on the brand.

5. **Conditional Redirection:**  
   If the user is on a mobile device (as determined by `getBrand`) and the brand is not "LloydsBusiness", an immediate client-side redirect is performed to the onelink URL.

6. **Page Trigger Conditions:**  
   At the end of the script, the extension checks the current URL (`window.location.href`) to determine which brand-specific function call should be executed based on the presence of specific path strings.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Regular Mobile Redirect for a Consumer App
- **URL:** https://lloydsbank.com/app.html  
- **Detection:**  
  The extension detects "lloydsbank.com/app.html" in the URL and calls `appStoreRedirect.onelink("Lloyds")`.  
- **Action:**  
  If a mobile device is detected (Android, iPhone, or iPad), the onelink URL is generated using the base URL from `onelinkURLs.Lloyds` with added tracking parameters.  
- **Outcome:**  
  The app store download buttons on the page have their `href` attributes updated, and the page automatically redirects to the generated URL.

### Scenario 2: Business Mobile Banking Page (Exception Handling)
- **URL:** https://lloydsbank.com/business/banking-online/online-for-business/business-mobile-banking.html  
- **Detection:**  
  The extension detects this URL and calls `appStoreRedirect.onelink("LloydsBusiness")`.  
- **Action:**  
  For "LloydsBusiness", the DOM update logic is adapted so that only a different parent node is updated. No automatic redirect is performed even if a mobile device is detected.  
- **Outcome:**  
  The badges are updated correctly, expecting that business users might have different navigation flows.

### Scenario 3: Non-Mobile User Access
- **URL:** User accesses on a desktop browser or no mobile signature returned by `getBrand`.  
- **Action:**  
  Though the app store links might be updated on the page, no automatic redirection occurs because `getBrand` does not return "y".  
- **Outcome:**  
  The user remains on the page and may manually interact with the updated links if needed.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Global Dependency:**  
  The code relies on the global `AF_SMART_SCRIPT` object being available. If this object is not present or incorrectly initialised, the URL generation will fail.

- **Device Detection Limitations:**  
  The device identification in `getBrand` is rudimentary, using string matching on the user agent. This might not cover all modern devices and browsers.

- **DOM Structure Assumptions:**  
  The logic updates the `href` attribute of HTML elements based on assumed parent node relationships. If the page structure changes, elements might not be correctly updated.

- **Brand Key Absence:**  
  If a URL is provided for a brand that does not exist in `onelinkURLs`, the code may attempt to work with an undefined URL, leading to errors.

- **Hard-Coded Query Checks:**  
  The code uses hard-coded strings for detecting query parameters (e.g. "forceandroid", "forceapple"). This approach may not catch variations or misconfigurations.

- **Tealium Integration Conflicts:**  
  Running this code after other tag extensions (given its scope "After Tag Extensions") might lead to conflicts if other scripts also manipulate the DOM or perform similar redirects.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Parameter & URL Validations:**  
  Introduce checks to validate the existence of expected keys in `appStoreRedirect.onelinkURLs` before using them to generate URLs. This ensures that the extension fails gracefully if an unknown brand is passed.

- **Modularise Redundant Code:**  
  Consider abstracting the logic that updates the DOM nodes (the loops for Android and Apple badges) into a separate helper function to reduce code duplication. For example, create a function that accepts the node list and the target parent node index to update the `href` attribute.

- **Improved Device Checks:**  
  The `getBrand` function could be enhanced by considering common mobile device patterns beyond simple string tests, although care must be taken given the ES5 requirement.

- **Defensive DOM Checks:**  
  Add null-checks before accessing `parentNode` properties to prevent runtime errors if the structure of the DOM changes.

- **Comment Clarity & Documentation:**  
  Add comments explaining why certain branches are used—especially the special case for "LloydsBusiness"—and note any expected DOM structure assumptions.

- **Error Handling:**  
  Although ES5 precludes some modern error handling techniques, wrapping critical operations (such as DOM manipulation or external function calls) in try-catch blocks can help safely log and bypass errors.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Testing:**  
  Thoroughly test the extension on multiple devices and browsers (both mobile and desktop) to ensure that redirection and link updates behave as expected.

- **Version Control:**  
  Use version control to document changes during refactoring or extensions, especially when global dependencies or DOM structures are modified.

- **Ownership & Support:**  
  Assign a dedicated owner(s) responsible for third-party dependencies such as the `AF_SMART_SCRIPT` library. Maintain up-to-date documentation of these dependencies.

- **Monitoring & Logging:**  
  Even though `testLogging` is currently set to false, consider enabling logging temporarily during maintenance windows to capture potential issues with device detection or URL generation.

- **Compatibility Considerations:**  
  As the extension is required to support ES5, any future enhancements should remain within the scope of ES5 features. Avoid modern syntax (such as arrow functions, let/const, template literals) to preserve compatibility.

- **Stakeholder Communication:**  
  Share documented updates and refactoring decisions with the broader development team and stakeholders to ensure that changes align with the overall digital strategy and do not conflict with parallel initiatives.
