# MAU : set cookie defaults Extension Documentation

This document provides detailed information about the "MAU : set cookie defaults" Tealium iQ extension. It includes an overview, in-depth code explanation, usage examples, known limitations, refactoring recommendations, and maintenance guidelines.

---

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** MAU : set cookie defaults  
- **ID:** 2260 (Extension ID: 100036)  
- **Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** Before Load Rules  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Once  

**Summary:**  
This extension is designed to set default cookie consent settings for ad storage. By default, it denies ad storage. However, if the incoming payload indicates that targeting cookies have been allowed (via the boolean flag "CookiesTargeting"), it updates the consent settings to grant ad storage. The code utilises a global array (window.uetq) to push consent commands, thereby integrating with the larger system that processes these cookie settings.

---

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables and Objects

- **window.uetq:**  
  A global array used for queuing commands related to cookie consent. The extension checks whether it exists and initialises it if not.

- **eventType and eventPayload:**  
  These parameters (passed as a and b respectively in the self-invoking function) are guaranteed to be present. The extension inspects the event payload for a specific property, "CookiesTargeting".

### Logic Flow

1. **Initialisation:**
   - The extension ensures that the global array `window.uetq` exists; if not, it creates an empty array.
   - It then pushes a default consent setting for ad storage with the value `'denied'`.
   
   ```javascript
   window.uetq = window.uetq || [];
   window.uetq.push('consent', 'default', {
       'ad_storage': 'denied'
   });
   ```

2. **Conditional Update:**
   - The code checks if the event payload (passed as parameter `b`) contains the property `"CookiesTargeting"` set to `true`.
   - If the condition is met, the extension pushes an update to change the ad storage setting from `'denied'` to `'granted'`.

   ```javascript
   if (b["CookiesTargeting"] === true) {
       window.uetq = window.uetq || [];
       window.uetq.push('consent', 'update', {
           'ad_storage': 'granted'
       });
   }
   ```

### Dependencies

- **Global Objects:**  
  The extension relies on the global `window` object and specifically the `window.uetq` array for communication with Tealiumâ€™s consent management framework.

- **Event Payload:**  
  The property `"CookiesTargeting"` within the event payload (`b`) is critical for determining whether cookie consent should be updated.

- **Tealium iQ Environment:**  
  This script is executed within the Tealium iQ environment and assumes that the necessary Tealium global functions and event parameters are available.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Conditions

**Scenario:** Targeting cookies are NOT allowed (default behaviour).
- **Input:**  
  Event payload (`b`) does not include `"CookiesTargeting": true` (e.g., it might be `false` or not set).
- **Process:**  
  - The global array `window.uetq` is initialised if not already present.
  - Default consent settings are pushed, resulting in `{'ad_storage': 'denied'}`.
- **Output:**  
  The cookie consent remains as denied for ad storage.

**Scenario:** Targeting cookies are allowed.
- **Input:**  
  Event payload (`b`) includes `"CookiesTargeting": true`.
- **Process:**  
  - The default consent is initially set to `denied`.
  - The condition evaluates to true, prompting an update command to set `{'ad_storage': 'granted'}`.
- **Output:**  
  The consent setting for ad storage is updated to granted, ensuring that targeting cookies are enabled.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Global Scope Dependency:**  
  The code writes directly to `window.uetq`, meaning there is a dependency on the global state. If other scripts or extensions manipulate this array simultaneously, unexpected behaviours could occur.

- **Sequencing Issues:**  
  Since the extension is executed "Before Load Rules" and set to "Run Once", its execution order relative to other consent management or cookie-setting extensions may affect the final state of cookie settings.

- **Lack of Error Handling:**  
  The extension assumes successful execution without any checks or error handling for potential conflicts or unexpected payload structures. Although the availability of the event parameters is guaranteed, other parts of the payload might not meet expected formats.

- **Integration with External Scripts:**  
  If external scripts or tags rely on the state of `window.uetq` before or after this extension runs, there may be conflicts or race conditions if multiple extensions update this global variable.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Use of Defensive Checks:**  
  While defensive coding for `eventType` and `eventPayload` is not required, consider adding checks for the structure of `eventPayload` if additional properties are later added.

- **Modularisation:**  
  Encapsulate the consent setting logic into separate functions. This would help improve readability and maintainability.
  
  Example (in ES5 style):
  ```javascript
  function setDefaultConsent() {
      window.uetq = window.uetq || [];
      window.uetq.push('consent', 'default', {'ad_storage': 'denied'});
  }

  function updateConsentIfAllowed(payload) {
      if (payload["CookiesTargeting"] === true) {
          window.uetq = window.uetq || [];
          window.uetq.push('consent', 'update', {'ad_storage': 'granted'});
      }
  }

  setDefaultConsent();
  updateConsentIfAllowed(eventPayload);
  ```

- **Code Comments:**  
  Continue to use clear inline comments to explain each code section. This aids future developers in understanding the purpose of each block.

- **Testing:**  
  Implement unit tests where feasible, simulating different event payloads to ensure that consent settings are pushed correctly. Testing should cover both standard and edge cases.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  - Ensure that the extension is tested whenever updates are made to the Tealium iQ environment or related global scripts.
  - Regularly review the global usage of `window.uetq` to avoid potential conflicts with new extensions or external code.

- **Ownership:**  
  Maintain a clear version control of the extension code. Any modifications should be documented in the version history with details about why changes were made.

- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Create test cases to simulate different configurations of the event payload.
  - Verify that consent commands are pushed to `window.uetq` as expected in both default and conditional scenarios.
  - Ensure that integration tests are in place to monitor potential conflicts with other Tealium extensions.

- **Documentation Updates:**  
  Update this documentation whenever there are changes to the consent logic or related configurations within the Tealium iQ platform.
