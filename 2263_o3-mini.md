# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation

This documentation outlines the details for the Tealium iQ extension titled "Appstore redirect - remove internal UTMs if paid". It covers an overview, code explanation, usage examples, known limitations, recommendations for refactoring, and maintenance notes.

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Appstore redirect - remove internal UTMs if paid
- **ID:** 2263 (Extension Internal ID), ExtensionId: 100040 (iQ Dashboard ID)
- **Type:** Advanced Javascript Code
- **Scope:** DOM Ready
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Once

**Summary:**  
This extension is designed to sanitise links on the "/current-accounts.html" page by removing unwanted UTM parameters from internal links. When the URL contains a utm_source parameter, it finds all anchor tags that reference '/app.html' and resets their href attribute to the clean, hard-coded URL "https://www.lloydsbank.com/app.html". This ensures that internal navigation is not affected by potentially misleading or unwanted UTM tracking parameters, especially for cases where the user has paid.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables & Objects
- **window.location.pathname:**  
  Used to determine the current page path.
  
- **new URLSearchParams(window.location.search):**  
  This global object parses the URL query string, allowing the extension to check for the presence of the 'utm_source' parameter.
  
- **document.querySelectorAll("a[href*='/app.html']"):**  
  Selects all anchor elements that contain '/app.html' in their href attribute. This is where the code targets internal app links.
  
- **AppNodes:**  
  A variable (declared with `var` under ES5 restrictions) that stores the list of matching anchor elements.

### Logic Flow
1. **Page Verification:**  
   The extension first verifies if the current page's path exactly matches "/current-accounts.html". If not, no further action is taken.

2. **UTM Parameter Check:**  
   The extension then checks if the URL query string contains a value for `utm_source` using `URLSearchParams`.

3. **Link Sanitisation:**  
   If the utm_source parameter is present, the code uses a loop (standard ES5 `for` loop) to iterate through all anchor elements selected by `document.querySelectorAll`.  
   - Inside the loop, it resets the `href` attribute of each matching element to "https://www.lloydsbank.com/app.html".

### Dependencies
- **Global Objects:**  
  The extension relies on browser global objects like `window` and `document`.
  
- **URLSearchParams:**  
  Uses the standard `URLSearchParams` API for search query parsing. Ensure that the target browsers support this API in an ES5 environment.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Normal Condition with UTMs
- **Input:**  
  URL of the page is "https://www.lloydsbank.com/current-accounts.html?utm_source=google".
  
- **Behaviour:**  
  - The extension detects that the page path is "/current-accounts.html".
  - Checks the URL query and finds that `utm_source` parameter is present.
  - Finds all `<a>` elements with href containing '/app.html'.
  - Rewrites each found elementâ€™s href attribute to "https://www.lloydsbank.com/app.html".
  
- **Output:**  
  All internal app links are sanitized, removing any embedded UTM parameters.

### Scenario 2: Condition without UTMs
- **Input:**  
  URL of the page is "https://www.lloydsbank.com/current-accounts.html" (no utm_source parameter included).
  
- **Behaviour:**  
  - The page path is matched.
  - The URL query is checked, but since `utm_source` is absent, the link sanitisation does not occur.
  
- **Output:**  
  The original href values for app links remain unchanged.

### Scenario 3: Page Path Mismatch
- **Input:**  
  URL of the page is "https://www.lloydsbank.com/other-page.html?utm_source=google".
  
- **Behaviour:**  
  - As the page path does not equal "/current-accounts.html", no further checks or operations are performed.
  
- **Output:**  
  The extension does nothing; all links remain intact.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Page Path Dependency:**  
  The code is strictly tied to the "/current-accounts.html" page. Any navigation structure changes or dynamic routing may require updating the path condition.
  
- **UTM Parameter Specificity:**  
  Only the presence of the `utm_source` parameter triggers the redirection. Other UTM parameters (e.g. utm_medium or utm_campaign) do not affect functionality.

- **Selector Specificity:**  
  The query selector `"a[href*='/app.html']"` relies on the substring match for the href attribute. If the internal linking structure changes or if additional query parameters are appended to the link, this might not capture all intended links.

- **Dependencies on Modern APIs:**  
  Usage of `new URLSearchParams()` means that this extension requires browsers that support this API. Although widely supported, some very old browsers (pre-ES5 or lacking modern API support) might not respond as expected.

- **Potential Conflicts:**  
  If other Tealium extensions or external scripts manipulate the same links or use similar selectors, there might be conflicts or overrides unless the execution order is carefully managed.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Coding:**  
  Although dependency availability (like `eventType` and `eventPayload`) is guaranteed, consider adding defensive coding practices for DOM elements:
  - Check if `document.querySelectorAll` returns a non-null NodeList.
  - Validate that the anchor elements indeed have an `href` attribute before trying to set it.

- **Code Style & Modularity:**  
  - Introduce modular functions if additional link manipulation logic is added in future.
  - Consider assigning descriptive variable names (e.g. rename `AppNodes` to `appLinkElements`) to improve code clarity.

- **Graceful Fallbacks:**  
  If targeting environments where `URLSearchParams` might not be supported, adding a fallback (polyfill or alternate query parsing) could be beneficial.

- **Comments & Documentation:**  
  Enhance inline comments to detail the purpose of each logic block for future maintainers. Document any assumptions such as the guaranteed presence of `utm_source`.

- **Performance Check:**  
  The current implementation loops through all potential matches; ensure that if the DOM contains a very large number of anchor elements, performance remains optimal.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Testing:**  
  - Establish regular functional tests after any changes in the linking structure or URL query parameter standards.
  - Consider manual testing on both desktop and mobile versions, ensuring that all conditions for the page path and query parameters are covered.

- **Version Control & Ownership:**  
  - Tag this extension code with appropriate version comments.
  - Assign ownership to a responsible developer or team to maintain compatibility with future Tealium updates.

- **Documentation Updates:**  
  - Regularly update this document in parallel with changes to the code.
  - Inform stakeholders and relevant team members if the extension behaviour is modified.

- **Environment Monitoring:**  
  - Keep track of browser compatibility updates, especially concerning global objects and APIs used in this extension.

- **Integration with Other Extensions:**  
  - Document any dependencies or shared variables with other Tealium iQ extensions.
  - If running multiple extensions on the same page, explicitly control the load order via the Tealium interface to avoid conflicts.

This documentation should serve as a comprehensive guide for developers and stakeholders to understand, maintain, and refactor the extension if required.
