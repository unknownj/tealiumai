# Cardnet Webchat Test Extension

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Cardnet Webchat Test  
- **Extension ID:** 2272  
- **Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** Before Load Rules  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Always  

**Summary:**  
This extension is designed to initialise and override the default behaviour of Salesforce’s Embedded Service Web Chat (LiveAgent) when a specific query parameter is detected in the search data (i.e. the search string includes "cardnetwebchat=test"). It sets a global override flag, injects custom CSS styles for the chat interface and mobile responsiveness, and defines a custom initialisation function (window.initESW) for configuring the Salesforce Embedded Service. Ultimately, it loads the required external Salesforce script and dynamically initialises the chat service, with a fallback mechanism if the primary script fails to load.

---

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables and Global Objects

- **a, b:**  
  The IIFE parameters. Although named generically, 'b' is used as the data object 
  (likely representing the event payload) with helper methods (such as Q).

- **b.Q():**  
  A method (assumed to be provided by Tealium) which is used to query whether a particular search string meets the condition. In this extension, it checks if the search string (converted to lower case) contains "cardnetwebchat=test".

- **b.WebchatPlatformOverride:**  
  A property set to "NewCardnet" when the condition is met. This likely signals other parts of the implementation or external systems that a Webchat override is active.

- **window.initESW:**  
  A function defined (if not already present) on the global window object that initialises the Salesforce Embedded Service Web Chat with custom settings.

- **embedded_svc:**  
  A global object (expected to be provided by the externally loaded Salesforce script) that holds the settings and initialisation methods for the chat service.

### Logic Flow and Data Processing

1. **Condition Checking:**  
   The extension first checks if the search string (accessed via b.Q) contains "cardnetwebchat=test". If the condition is met, it proceeds with the override logic.

2. **Platform Override:**  
   Upon a positive condition, it sets `b.WebchatPlatformOverride` to "NewCardnet."

3. **CSS Injection:**  
   - Checks if `window.initESW` is undefined, indicating that the chat service has not been initialised yet.
   - Creates a `<style>` element containing custom CSS rules for mobile responsiveness (adjusting padding of minimise/close buttons on small screens) and custom appearance for the Salesforce Embedded Service Help Button.
   - Appends the style element into the document head.

4. **Defining window.initESW:**  
   - The function configures `window.embedded_svc.settings` (enabled features, language, help button settings, and extra prechat form details such as "First Name" and "Last Name").
   - Sets up a `directToButtonRouting` function to change the routing based on a user’s prechat form input (checks the value of the third prechat form field for "Yes" or "No").
   - Calls `embedded_svc.init` with parameters including the Salesforce domain, site URL, organisation ID, the deployed chat button configuration, and other required parameters (live agent URLs, deployment IDs, etc.).

5. **Script Loading:**  
   - A helper function (`loadChatScript`) is implemented to load external scripts asynchronously by creating a `<script>` element and appending it to the document body.
   - The primary script is loaded from `https://service.force.com/embeddedservice/5.0/esw.min.js`.
   - Once loaded, it checks if `window.embedded_svc` is available.
   - If not, it falls back and attempts to load the script from an alternative URL (`https://firstforce--macaw.sandbox.my.salesforce.com/embeddedservice/5.0/esw.min.js`), and then calls `window.initESW` with a null parameter.
   - If `window.embedded_svc` is available on the first load, it calls `window.initESW` with `'https://service.force.com'` as the parameter for the gslbBaseURL.

### Dependencies

- **Global Objects:**  
  The code depends on `window`, `document`, and the externally loaded `embedded_svc` object from Salesforce.

- **External Scripts:**  
  The extension relies on an external Salesforce-provided script (`esw.min.js`), loaded from a primary URL with a fallback if needed.

- **Tealium Functions:**  
  The method `b.Q()` is assumed to be provided by Tealium to manage query conditions on event data.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Scenario

- **Input:**  
  An event payload contains a search string such as "User query with cardnetwebchat=test".
  
- **Process:**  
  - The condition is met when `b.Q("search.toLowerCase contains cardnetwebchat=test")` evaluates to true.
  - `b.WebchatPlatformOverride` is set, CSS is injected and `window.initESW` is defined.
  - The primary chat script is loaded; once loaded, `embedded_svc` is checked.
  - The initialisation function (`window.initESW('https://service.force.com')`) is called to set up the Salesforce Embedded Service Web Chat.

- **Outcome:**  
  The user sees the web chat interface with the custom styling and configured prechat fields. Live Agent routing is set up based on the user’s input ("Yes" or "No").

### Edge Scenario

- **Input:**  
  An event payload does not contain the string "cardnetwebchat=test".
  
- **Process:**  
  - The condition check fails.
  - None of the override logic, style injection, custom initialisation or script loading is executed.

- **Outcome:**  
  The extension remains inactive, and the standard behaviour of the web chat/rendering is used.

### Script Loading Fallback Example

- **Scenario:**  
  The primary URL (`https://service.force.com/embeddedservice/5.0/esw.min.js`) fails to properly initialise the `embedded_svc` object.

- **Process:**  
  - The initial script load calls its callback.
  - Since `embedded_svc` is not defined, the fallback script is loaded from `https://firstforce--macaw.sandbox.my.salesforce.com/embeddedservice/5.0/esw.min.js`.
  - Once this script loads, `window.initESW(null)` is executed.

- **Outcome:**  
  The extension successfully initialises the chat service using the fallback configuration.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Reliance on Tealium Q Method:**  
  The extension assumes that `b.Q()` is always available and that the search field value will contain the query string in a specific format.

- **Global Namespace Pollution:**  
  The extension sets global variables (e.g. `window.initESW` and `b.WebchatPlatformOverride`), which might conflict with other scripts or extensions that use these same namespaces.

- **CSS Injection:**  
  The inline CSS is appended directly to the document head every time the extension runs (if `window.initESW` is not defined). This could cause duplication or unexpected overrides if multiple extensions inject similar styling.

- **Script Loading Race Conditions:**  
  There may be potential timing issues, particularly if the external resources have delayed responses or if the fallback script loads after some dependency or a timeout period. If multiple integrations attempt to load `esw.min.js` from different sources, conflicts may occur.

- **Hardcoded URLs and IDs:**  
  The script includes hardcoded Salesforce URLs, deployment IDs, and configuration values. Changes in the Salesforce environment or deployment may require manual updates.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Modularisation:**  
  Consider breaking out the script-loading logic, style injection, and Salesforce initialisation into smaller named functions. This would improve readability and testability.

- **Avoid Duplicate Injections:**  
  Implement a mechanism to check for already-injected styles (e.g. use a unique ID on the `<style>` element) to ensure the same styles are not appended multiple times.

- **Error Handling:**  
  While defensive coding for the parameters is not required (given that eventType and eventPayload are guaranteed), consider adding error handling around external script loads (e.g. handling the `onerror` event) to manage failed script loads more gracefully.

- **Configuration Centralisation:**  
  Store configuration values (URLs, deployment IDs, button IDs, etc.) in a separate configuration object to simplify future updates and reduce hardcoding within the code.

- **Avoid Global Pollution:**  
  Instead of directly attaching functions and properties to the global window object, you could encapsulate the logic within a singleton or a namespace to reduce the risk of conflicting with other scripts (taking into account the ES5 requirement).

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  - Ensure that any changes to Salesforce service endpoints or deployment configurations are updated in the extension.
  - Monitor for any changes in Salesforce’s Embedded Service API that might affect how `embedded_svc.init` or `embedded_svc.settings` should be configured.

- **Ownership:**  
  - Assign a team or individual responsible for maintaining the extension to coordinate updates, especially if Salesforce or Tealium changes impact this integration.

- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Test the extension in staging environments and on multiple device form factors (desktop and mobile) to ensure the CSS and chat initialisation performs as expected.
  - Validate both normal and edge case behaviours: when the query parameter is present versus absent, primary and fallback script loading and error cases.
  - Use browser developer tools to ensure that duplicate style elements and global namespace collisions are not occurring.

- **Documentation Updates:**  
  - Keep the documentation in sync with any code updates.
  - Use version control (e.g. Git) and document changes through commit messages and release notes.
