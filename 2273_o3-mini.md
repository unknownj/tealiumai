# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** locate all QR codes on the site  
- **ID:** 2273  
- **Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** After Load Rules  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Always  

### Summary

This extension is designed to scan the current web page for elements marked as <code>picture</code> that contain the substring "qr" in their inner HTML. For each matching element, it attempts to extract a QR code identifier from a child element (using the attribute <code>data-selector</code>). The extension then appends (or initialises) a custom property called <code>CustomList</code> on the event payload object with a prefix ("QRs/") followed by the extracted QR codes. This allows downstream extensions or analytics processes to recognise and utilise QR code data embedded in the page.

------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables

- **divs:**  
  - Obtained via <code>document.querySelectorAll("picture")</code>; it contains a list of all <code>picture</code> elements on the page.
  
- **qrs:**  
  - An empty array initialised to collect QR code identifiers (retrieved from the <code>data-selector</code> attribute).

- **qrType:**  
  - A variable used to hold the value of the <code>data-selector</code> attribute from child elements, representing the QR type.

### Logic Flow

1. **Element Selection:**  
   - The script collects all <code>picture</code> elements.
   
2. **Iteration and Processing:**  
   - A loop iterates over all selected elements.
   - For each element, it checks if the element's inner HTML contains the substring "qr".
   - If the substring is found:
     - It checks if there exists a descendant element with the attribute <code>data-selector</code>.
     - If found, it retrieves the value of <code>data-selector</code> and assigns it to <code>qrType</code>.
     - The <code>qrType</code> value is then pushed onto the <code>qrs</code> array.
     
3. **Merge with Existing Data:**  
   - Post iteration, the function checks if the <code>CustomList</code> property already exists on the event payload object (b).
   - If <code>CustomList</code> exists, the new data is concatenated using <code>concat</code>, with a separator string <code>":QRs/"</code> and the list converted to a string.
   - If it does not exist, <code>CustomList</code> is set to a new string starting with "QRs/" followed by the comma-separated list of extracted QR codes.

### Dependencies

- **Global Objects:**  
  - The function expects two global variables, <code>eventType</code> and <code>eventPayload</code> (aliased as 'a' and 'b' respectively in the IIFE), to be available and contain the required data types.
- **DOM Methods:**  
  - Uses standard DOM methods like <code>document.querySelectorAll</code> and <code>querySelector</code> provided by the browser.

------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Normal Operation

- **Input:**  
  - The HTML page contains multiple <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code> elements.
  - Some of these elements include the substring "qr" in their inner HTML.
  - Each such <code>picture</code> houses a descendant element with a valid <code>data-selector</code> attribute.

- **Behaviour:**  
  - The extension iterates over each <code>picture</code> element.
  - For matching elements, it extracts the QR code identifier and appends it to the <code>qrs</code> array.
  - The <code>CustomList</code> property in <code>eventPayload</code> is updated (or initialised) with a string starting with "QRs/" followed by the comma-separated list of extracted QR identifiers.

### Scenario 2: Edge Conditions

- **No Matching Elements:**  
  - When no <code>picture</code> element contains "qr" in its inner HTML.
  - Result: The <code>qrs</code> array remains empty and <code>CustomList</code> is set to "QRs/" or appended with an empty string.
  
- **Pre-existing CustomList:**  
  - If <code>eventPayload.CustomList</code> is already present.
  - Result: The extension concatenates the new QR codes to the existing <code>CustomList</code> string using ":QRs/" as the separator.

- **Multiple Data-Selector Matches:**  
  - Only the first descendant element with the data-selector attribute (found via <code>querySelector</code>) is processed per <code>picture</code> element, even if multiple may exist.

------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Accuracy of HTML Search:**  
  - The extension utilises a simple <code>indexOf</code> check for the substring "qr". This might lead to false positives if "qr" appears in an unrelated context or miss codes where the string is presented in uppercase or with additional formatting.

- **Multiple QR Codes in a Single Element:**  
  - The current logic only retrieves the first occurrence from a child element with a <code>data-selector</code> attribute. In cases where there might be multiple QR codes within a single <code>picture</code> element, only one will be captured.

- **Dependency on DOM Structure:**  
  - The extension assumes that <code>data-selector</code> is reliably present when "qr" appears in the HTML. If the structure changes or if custom attributes are renamed, the extension will not retrieve the necessary data.

- **Potential Conflicts:**  
  - If other Tealium extensions modify or rely on <code>eventPayload.CustomList</code>, there may be conflicts. It is important to ensure that any other processes using this property are aware of the appended string format.

------------------------------------------------------------

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks:**  
  - Although conditions for <code>eventType</code> and <code>eventPayload</code> exist, consider additional checks on the DOM elements for robustness, e.g. verifying that <code>querySelector</code> returns a non-null value before attempting to access the attribute.

- **Code Style & Readability:**  
  - Introduce more descriptive variable names (e.g. <code>pictureElements</code> instead of <code>divs</code>, and <code>qrCodes</code> instead of <code>qrs</code>) to improve maintainability.
  - Modularise the extraction logic into small reusable functions if the codebase expands.
  
- **Handling Multiple Attributes:**  
  - If future enhancements require processing multiple elements within one <code>picture</code> tag, adjust the query to capture and loop through all relevant descendants.

- **Documentation in Code:**  
  - Include inline comments to explain the purpose of key code blocks, especially around data appending logic, to assist future developers in understanding the flow.

*Note: Do not modify the code to utilise ES6 features (e.g. let/const, arrow functions) as ES5 support is mandatory.*

------------------------------------------------------------

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  - Periodically review the extension in the context of updates to the webpageâ€™s HTML structure. Changes in element semantics or attribute names may require updates to the extension logic.
  - Keep a versioned archive of extension snapshots to enable rollback if subsequent changes introduce issues.

- **Ownership:**  
  - Assign a team member as the primary contact for this extension, responsible for updates and bug fixes.
  
- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Implement manual and automated tests for various scenarios including pages with no QR codes, pages with one or multiple QR codes, and pages where the <code>CustomList</code> is pre-initialised.
  - Validate behaviour in different browsers to ensure compatibility with ES5.

- **Integration with Other Extensions:**  
  - Document any dependencies or interactions with other Tealium iQ extensions (especially those that target <code>eventPayload.CustomList</code>) to ensure smooth data flow and conflict resolution.

This documentation should provide a comprehensive overview of the functionality, usage, and maintenance considerations for the "locate all QR codes on the site" extension. Feedback and iterative updates to this document are encouraged as the extension and overall system evolve.
