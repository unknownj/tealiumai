# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation

This document provides comprehensive details about the "Division Override for Business Domains" Tealium iQ extension. It covers an overview of the extension, code explanation, usage examples, known limitations, recommendations for refactoring, and further maintenance notes.

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Division Override for Business Domains  
- **Extension ID:** 2274  
- **Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** After Load Rules  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Always

**Summary:**  
This extension is designed to override the division (set to "Commercial") when the current domain (obtained from window.location.hostname) matches one of a specified list of business domain strings. It runs on every page load, ensuring that if any of the defined domain strings are present in the hostname, the event payload property "Division" will be updated accordingly. This is particularly useful for segmentation or data handling in cases where different business domains must be tagged with a specific division value.

---

## 2. Code Explanation

**Key Variables and Logic Flow:**

- **businessDomainMatches:**  
  An array containing the list of domain strings that represent business-specific domains. The array includes four specific domain patterns:
  - "securebusiness.lloydsbank.co.uk"
  - "onlinebusiness.lloydsbank.co.uk"
  - "secure-business.bankofscotland.co.uk"
  - "online-business.bankofscotland.co.uk"

- **Iteration Over Domains:**  
  The code utilises the `forEach` method to iterate over each domain in the `businessDomainMatches` array.

- **Domain Matching:**  
  For each domain in the list:
  - The code checks whether the current website's hostname (obtained from `window.location.hostname`) contains the domain string.
  - This is achieved by using the `indexOf` method; if the method returns a value greater than -1, it indicates a match.

- **Setting the Division:**  
  If a match is found, the code assigns the string "Commercial" to the `Division` property of the `eventPayload` object (passed as parameter `b`).

**Dependencies & Global Objects:**

- **Global Objects:**
  - `window.location.hostname`: Used for retrieving the current domain.
  - Global `eventPayload` (passed in as the parameter `b`): Expected to be an object where the division override is applied.
  
- **Parameters:**
  - `eventType`: Though passed in as the parameter `a`, it is not used in this extension.
  - `eventPayload`: Used to set the `Division` property to "Commercial" when a match is found.

- **ES5 Compatibility:**  
  The extension is strictly compatible with ES5 syntax as there is no use of ES6 features such as arrow functions or block-scoped variables (let/const).

## 3. Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Normal Domain Match

- **Input:**  
  - Current hostname: "securebusiness.lloydsbank.co.uk"
  - `eventPayload` object does not have an existing "Division" property.
  
- **Behaviour:**  
  - The hostname contains "securebusiness.lloydsbank.co.uk".
  - The code sets `eventPayload.Division` to "Commercial".
  
- **Outcome:**  
  `eventPayload` now includes:
  ```javascript
  {
    Division: "Commercial",
    // other properties remain unchanged
  }
  ```

### Scenario 2: No Domain Match

- **Input:**  
  - Current hostname: "www.example.com"
  - `eventPayload` object initialising properties as usual.
  
- **Behaviour:**  
  - No match is found in the hostname against the `businessDomainMatches` array.
  - The extension does not modify the `Division` property.
  
- **Outcome:**  
  `eventPayload` remains unmodified with respect to the "Division" property.

### Scenario 3: Multiple Matches (Edge Condition)

- **Input:**  
  - Current hostname: "secure-business.bankofscotland.co.uk.malicious.com"  
    (hostname contains the target string as a substring at a non-standard position)
  - `eventPayload` object is provided.
  
- **Behaviour:**  
  - The code will match the target substring (since it simply uses indexOf()).
  - The code will set `Division` to "Commercial" even if the match is part of a longer, unexpected hostname string.
  
- **Outcome:**  
  The division is set to "Commercial", though this may be considered an unintended edge case.

---

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Overly Broad Matching:**  
  - The use of `indexOf` to find domain matches can lead to false positives if the target domain substring occurs as part of a larger string that does not represent the actual domain. For instance, "secure-business.bankofscotland.co.uk.malicious.com" would erroneously trigger the override.

- **Single Responsibility:**  
  - The extension only sets the `Division` property. If there is any need to add more conditions or override additional properties, this single focus might require refactoring.
  
- **Potential Conflicts:**  
  - If other Tealium extensions or external scripts are also modifying the `eventPayload.Division` property (especially ones falling later in the execution order), there might be unintended overwrites or conflicts.
  
- **No Logging or Error Reporting:**  
  - The code does not provide any logging for successful matches or failures, which can hinder debugging in multi-extension environments.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks and Clarity:**  
  - Although defensive coding for the presence of `eventType` and `eventPayload` is not required, consider adding comments to explain the assumptions regarding these parameters.
  - Introduce a named function to encapsulate the domain-check logic for better modularity and reusability.

- **Improved Domain Matching:**  
  - Consider using stricter matching techniques to avoid false positives. This may include regular expressions (while keeping within ES5 standards) or checking that the matched domain corresponds exactly to the end of the hostname.
  
- **Code Readability:**  
  - Modularise the code by moving the domain-check logic into a separate helper function. This can improve readability and maintenance.

- **Commenting and Documentation:**  
  - Increase inline documentation to help other developers understand the logic without digging into the code.

Example (Refactored Approaches in ES5 syntax):

/* 
function isBusinessDomain(hostname, domain) {
  // Ensure the hostname ends with the domain string, preceded by a dot or matching exactly.
  var pattern = new RegExp("(^|\\.)" + domain.replace(/\./g, "\\.") + "$");
  return pattern.test(hostname);
}

(function(a, b){
  var businessDomainMatches = [
    "securebusiness.lloydsbank.co.uk",
    "onlinebusiness.lloydsbank.co.uk",
    "secure-business.bankofscotland.co.uk",
    "online-business.bankofscotland.co.uk"
  ];
  
  var currentHostname = window.location.hostname;
  
  businessDomainMatches.forEach(function(domain){
    if (isBusinessDomain(currentHostname, domain)) {
      b.Division = "Commercial";
    }
  });
})(eventType, eventPayload);
*/

*Note: The above refactoring is only suggested to improve accuracy, and the implementation details must be tested thoroughly.*

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Testing:**  
  - Regularly test the extension in different environments and with varied hostname inputs to ensure that the domain matching logic remains effective and does not produce false positives.
  - Develop unit tests or use sandbox environments to verify that changes in the business domains list are correctly reflected.

- **Ownership:**  
  - Assign clear ownership or a responsible team for maintaining Tealium extensions.  
  - Maintain a version-controlled repository for these extension scripts with proper commit messages reflecting the changes.

- **Documentation Updates:**  
  - Update this documentation when new domains are added to the businessDomainMatches array or if the functionality is expanded.
  - Include any consequential changes in the release notes for consistency.

- **Integration with Other Extensions:**  
  - Regularly review interactions with other Tealium iQ extensions to avoid conflicting modifications to the `eventPayload` object.
  - Document any specific ordering of execution if multiple scripts need to modify the same properties.
