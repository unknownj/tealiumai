# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation

## 1. Extension Overview
- **Name**: CBO AppsFlyer Simulator
- **ID**: 2276
- **Type**: Javascript Code
- **Scope**: DOM Ready
- **Execution Frequency**: Run Once

### Summary
This extension is designed to simulate the functionality of AppsFlyer in terms of handling URLs and parameters for mobile attribution. It sets up a series of variables and functions meant to facilitate click tracking, media source management, and parameter validation within the web environment. The extension is particularly useful for testing the interactions and flows of URLs that integrate with AppsFlyer, ensuring proper handling of associated advertising attributes.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
The extension defines two primary objects, `pollutionObject1` and `pollutionObject2`, which contain settings for both versions of the AppsFlyer tracking. Each object includes:
- **URL Schemes**: Definitions used to parse URLs.
- **Parameter Keys**: Important keys such as `GOOGLE_CLICK_ID` and `FACEBOOK_CLICK_ID` to reference in tracking.
- **Exclusion Keys**: Parameters that should be excluded from tracking, aiding in data cleanliness.
- **Function Definitions**: A multitude of utility functions for processing and validating various parameters tied to the tracking procedures.

### Logic Flow
1. **Cookie Check**: The extension begins by checking if a specific cookie (`testgloballeak=true`) exists.
2. **Creation of Pollution Objects**: If the cookie is found, two pollution objects are created, and their properties are mapped to the global `window` object for availability site-wide.
3. **Functionality Initiation**: Various utility functions are defined within these objects, facilitating actions such as URL validation, parameter extraction, and handling platform checks (e.g., iOS).

### Dependencies
This code relies on the global `window` object to store its properties and methods, making them accessible throughout the web application. No external libraries are referenced in the code.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Condition
When a user navigates to the site with the cookie `testgloballeak=true` set in their browser, the extension executes:
- Sets up URL patterns and parameters.
- Excludes specified parameters from the tracking URLs, ensuring only relevant data is sent to AppsFlyer.

### Edge Condition
If the cookie is not present:
- The script does not run; thus, no properties or functions are attached to the `window` object, affecting any tracking or analytics that rely on the extension.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas
- **Cookie Dependency**: The entire functionality of the extension is contingent upon the presence of the specified cookie. If the cookie is absent, no operation occurs.
- **Conflict Potential**: If other extensions or scripts also attempt to modify the global `window` object, name collisions may occur, resulting in unexpected behaviour.
- **Browser Compatibility**: Given that the extension includes extensive usage of cookie checks and URL manipulations, newer browser policies concerning cookies, especially third-party cookies, may impact its performance.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring
- **Error Handling**: Introduce logging or alternative flows when expected parameters are missing or invalid. This would help in debugging and identifying issues.
- **Function Modularisation**: To increase maintainability, consider refactoring the larger functions into smaller, more focused utilities.
- **Code Comments**: Add comprehensive comments throughout the code to clarify the intent and logic behind critical sections, which will enhance readability and support future modifications.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes
- **Ownership**: Assign a specific team or individual to maintain the extension, ensuring they are familiar with its structure and functionality.
- **Testing Guidance**: Regularly test the extension across various environments to ensure its operations remain intact, especially after updates to other related codebases or libraries.
- **Documentation Updates**: Keep this documentation current with any changes made to the extension. As features are added or modified, be certain to reflect those revisions in this document.
