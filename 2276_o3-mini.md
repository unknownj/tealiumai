# CBO AppsFlyer Simulator Documentation

This document provides an in-depth overview, explanation, usage examples, known limitations, refactoring recommendations, and maintenance notes for the CBO AppsFlyer Simulator extension.

---

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** CBO AppsFlyer Simulator  
- **Extension ID:** 100036 (internal Tealium extension reference; code-specific instance ID: 2276)  
- **Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** DOM Ready  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Once

**Summary:**  
This extension simulates the AppsFlyer tracking functionality by, under specific conditions, injecting configuration objects and associated functions into the global window object. The purpose is to mimic or test pollution of the global namespace with AppsFlyer configuration parameters and helper functions when a particular cookie is present ("testgloballeak=true"). This setup is useful in testing tracking behaviour and ensuring that integrations that rely on these parameters are triggered correctly.

---

## 2. Code Explanation

### Condition Check
- The extension first checks whether the browser’s document cookies include the string "testgloballeak=true".  
- If the condition is not met, none of the subsequent code is executed.

### Main Logic Flow
- Once the cookie condition is met, an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) is called with two objects as parameters.
  
  - **pollutionObject1:**  
    Contains configuration values and parameters related to AppsFlyer tracking.  
    - Properties include URL scheme patterns, expected number of URL parts, parameter keys (e.g. GOOGLE_CLICK_ID, ASSOCIATED_AD_KEYWORD), lists of keys to be excluded from custom and GCLID parameters, media source and campaign defaults, and a preconstructed result URL.
    - It also holds a property "AF_SMART_SCRIPT" which in turn contains a version identifier.
    
  - **pollutionObject2:**  
    Contains additional configuration data and a set of functions.
    - It provides further keys such as FACEBOOK_CLICK_ID, GBRAID, WBRAID.
    - It also contains functions that simulate tracking behaviour or utility operations (for example: isSkippedURL, getGoogleClickIdParameters, stringifyParameters, among many others). Each function logs a message to the console and returns a constant value ('AF').
    - Similar to the first object, it holds version information and a nested "AF_SMART_SCRIPT" property.
  
- **Assignment to Global Namespace:**  
  The IIFE iterates over each key in both pollution objects. For every key, the corresponding value (whether a primitive, array, or function) is assigned directly to the global window object. This essentially “pollutes” the global namespace with configuration and helper properties expected by AppsFlyer tracking code or tests simulating the tracking behaviour.

### Dependencies & Global Interactions
- The extension depends on:
  - The browser’s `document.cookie` to determine whether the pollution simulation should be executed.
  - The global `window` object where keys from both objects are stored.
- No external libraries are required. All features are implemented in vanilla ES5 JavaScript.

---

## 3. Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Normal Operation (Cookie Not Present)
- User visits the page and the document.cookie does not include "testgloballeak=true".  
- The conditional statement fails and the IIFE is not executed.
- No pollution occurs on the global object, and the extension exits silently.

### Scenario 2: Pollution Triggered (Cookie Present)
- A test cookie "testgloballeak=true" is set in the user’s browser.
- On page load (DOM Ready), the extension executes the IIFE.
- The properties and functions from both pollutionObject1 and pollutionObject2 are iterated over and assigned to the window object.
- **Example data flow:**  
  - After execution, accessing `window.AF_URL_SCHEME` will return the URL scheme pattern defined in pollutionObject1.
  - Similarly, calling `window.isSkippedURL()` will log "CBO Pollution Test: isSkippedURL" in the console and return 'AF'.
- This setup allows testers to simulate the scenario where global configuration for AppsFlyer is in place.

### Edge Conditions
- **Unexpected Property Overwrites:**  
  If any of the keys already exist on the global window object, they will be overwritten without any check. This behaviour is intentional as part of the simulation but may affect other scripts if not carefully coordinated.
- **Functionality Limits:**  
  All functions in pollutionObject2 use simple console logging and return a single constant ('AF'). They do not perform any real processing or parameter validation beyond simulating the call.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Global Namespace Pollution:**  
  Directly assigning properties and functions to the window object can conflict with other scripts or Tealium extensions that rely on the same global keys.
  
- **No Collision Handling:**  
  There are no defensive checks to prevent property overwriting. If another script has defined a property with the same name, it will be overridden.
  
- **Static Returns in Functions:**  
  The functions within pollutionObject2 only log a message and return 'AF'. They are not dynamically processing real parameters or context, which might limit the extension’s usefulness beyond simulation.
  
- **Browser Environment Dependency:**  
  The extension assumes execution within a browser (document.cookie and window are used). Server-side rendering or non-browser contexts are not supported.
  
- **Potential Performance Impact:**  
  If the pollution objects become large or if many global assignments occur, there could be a minor performance impact during the initial page load, especially on lower-end devices.

- **ES5 Limitation:**  
  Refactoring suggestions must keep ES5 compatibility, so more modern language features cannot be used.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Namespace Encapsulation:**  
  Instead of directly polluting the global window object, encapsulate the properties within a single namespace (for example, window.AppsFlyerConfig). This reduces the risk of conflicts.

- **Defensive Checks:**  
  Before assigning a value to window, check if the key already exists, or provide a reconciliation mechanism to merge old and new values.

  Example (in ES5):
  function assignIfNotExists(key, value) {
      if (typeof window[key] === 'undefined') {
          window[key] = value;
      } else {
          // Optionally, handle merging or logging a warning.
      }
  }
  
- **Modularisation:**  
  Consider splitting the configuration and functions into separate modules. Although ES5 does not support modules natively, patterns such as Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE) can be used to encapsulate functionality.

- **Logging and Debugging:**  
  Enhance the logging functionality to include error checking or condition-based logging that might be toggled based on an environment flag, rather than always logging to the console.

- **Code Comments & Documentation:**  
  Ensure that clear comments are added throughout the code to explain why each key is added to the global object and the intended simulation usage.

- **Testing:**  
  Include unit tests for each helper function to simulate their expected return values, even if they currently just return a constant string. This future-proofs refactoring or any updates to logic.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**
  - Designate a specific owner or team responsible for AppsFlyer integrations. Ensure that any changes to the simulated configuration are communicated and documented.
  - Periodically review global keys to ensure no conflicts arise as other Tealium extensions or website scripts get updated.
  
- **Testing Guidelines:**
  - Unit tests should be written for all helper functions within pollutionObject2 to validate that they log expected messages and return the correct value.
  - Integration testing should confirm that when the "testgloballeak=true" cookie is present, the global window object has all the expected properties.
  - Consider environmental tests to simulate both the presence and absence of the test cookie.

- **Documentation Updates:**
  - Maintain this document in the project repository (e.g. in an appropriate docs folder) to ensure that all developers have access to the latest details.
  - Update documentation when adding new keys, modifying existing functions, or adjusting the execution behaviour.

- **Future Enhancements:**
  - If real tracking functionality is needed in the future, refactor the simulation code to integrate with actual parameter processing modules.
  - Explore opportunities to abstract configuration settings so that multiple extensions can share a common codebase for handling tracking parameters.
