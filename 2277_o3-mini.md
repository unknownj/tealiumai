# DeepLinkURL Extension Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive overview and technical explanation for the DeepLinkURL Tealium iQ extension. The details below cover key aspects of the extension, including its purpose, code workflow, usage examples, known limitations, suggestions for improvement, and ongoing maintenance recommendations.

---

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** DeepLinkURL  
- **Extension ID:** 2277  
- **Extension Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** 1459  
- **Execution Frequency:** Runs on every event (i.e. when the extension is triggered as part of the page load or event processing)

**Summary:**  
The DeepLinkURL extension is designed to generate a deep link URL that is passed to AppsFlyer. It inspects incoming event data (specifically looking at campaign parameters such as CampaignSource, CampaignMedium, etc.), maps them to the appropriate query parameters and applies override values as necessary. The resulting query string is then appended to the base URL (retrieved from the CanonicalURL) to form a deep link URL. Further, the extension sanitises data by removing any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) such as email addresses.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables & Objects

- **Function Parameters:**  
  - `a`: Represents the event type (not used directly in the extension logic).  
  - `b`: Represents the event payload; expected to contain campaign-related data (e.g. CanonicalURL, CampaignSource, CampaignMedium, CampaignName, etc.).  
  - `u`: Represents the tag object that’s used to store the extension’s namespace and data (`u.dlv`).

- **u.dlv Object:**  
  Once initialised, `u.dlv` contains two main properties:
  - `eligibilityExpressions`: An array containing conditions (as strings) which must be satisfied for the deep link URL to be generated.  
  - `dataItems`: An array of mapping definitions of the query parameters. Each item includes:
    - `fieldName`: The name of the query parameter.  
    - `src`: The source field from the payload or a literal value.  
    - `overrideValues` (optional): A mapping of override values if the source value matches a specific key.  
    - `defaultValue`: A fallback value if the source is missing or undefined.

### Logic Flow

1. **Initial Setup:**  
   The extension first checks if `u.dlv` is already defined. If it is not, it initialises the base URL from `b.CanonicalURL` and then constructs the `u.dlv` object with its `dataItems` and `eligibilityExpressions`.

2. **Eligibility Check:**  
   The extension evaluates each expression contained in `u.dlv.eligibilityExpressions` using the `LBGAnalytics.Q` function. Only if all expressions return true (using the `every` method) does the extension proceed to the data mapping stage.

3. **Data Mapping:**  
   For each item in `u.dlv.dataItems`, the code performs:  
   - A check to see if the `src` field is undefined. If so, it assigns the `defaultValue` before progressing.  
   - An override check: If `overrideValues` is present, the code iterates (using `Object.entries` and a callback) over the mappings and applies the override if the source value matches any of the defined keys.  
   - A general assignment: If neither of the special conditions applies, it assigns the raw source value to the corresponding field in `u.dlv.data`.

4. **PII Removal:**  
   Before generating the final URL, the extension iterates over all entries in `u.dlv.data` and wipes out values that appear to hold an email (or email-encoded with `%40`). This ensures that no PII is inadvertently passed through.

5. **Query String Generation:**  
   The code then creates a query string from the `u.dlv.data` object using `URLSearchParams` and appends it to the base URL. The complete deep link URL is stored in `b.DeepLinkURL`.

### Dependencies

- **Global Objects/Functions:**  
  - `LBGAnalytics.Q`: This function is used to evaluate the eligibility expressions. Its implementation should exist in the global scope.  
  - The code assumes that campaign related fields (e.g. `CanonicalURL`, `CampaignSource`, `CampaignMedium`, etc.) are provided on the `b` (payload) object.  
  - URLSearchParams is used to build the query string; while it is standard in modern browsers, care should be taken if supporting legacy browsers.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Operation

- **Scenario:**  
  A visitor lands on a web page with UTM parameters (e.g. utm_source, utm_medium) and a canonical URL.  
- **Data Flow:**  
  1. The payload (`b`) contains values such as `CanonicalURL`, `CampaignSource`, `CampaignMedium`, `CampaignName`, etc.  
  2. The `eligibilityExpressions` such as "PresentationFamily contains Webview" and "search contains utm" are met.  
  3. Each data item is populated:  
     - For example, if `CampaignSource` is "youtube", the override in the mapping converts it to "googleads_int".  
     - If any identifier such as the email is present, it is cleared (set to an empty string).  
  4. The final URL becomes:  
     (CanonicalURL) + "?" + (constructed query parameters)  
- **Outcome:**  
  The deep link URL is successfully generated and stored in `b.DeepLinkURL`.

### Edge Conditions

- **Missing Source Data:**  
  - If a campaign parameter (e.g., `CampaignSource`) is missing from the payload, the code assigns the defined default value ("website" in most cases).  
- **Override Conditions Not Met:**  
  - If the `src` data does not match any key in the `overrideValues`, then the original source value is used.  
- **PII Presence:**  
  - If any query parameter value contains an "@" or its URL-encoded version ("%40"), that value is cleared to prevent PII leakage.  
- **Eligibility Fail:**  
  - If one (or more) of the eligibility expressions evaluated via `LBGAnalytics.Q` return false, the mapping process does not occur and no deep link URL is generated.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Dependency on LBGAnalytics.Q:**  
  - The extension relies on a global function `LBGAnalytics.Q` to evaluate eligibility expressions. If this function is not available or does not perform as expected, the extension’s data mapping is bypassed.
  
- **PII Handling:**  
  - The PII check is rudimentary; it only looks for the presence of "@" or "%40". There is a possibility that some PII could slip through if it does not conform to these patterns.

- **URLSearchParams Support:**  
  - The use of `URLSearchParams` may be problematic in older browsers that do not support this API. Although modern browsers should have no issues, this dependency may require a polyfill for legacy support.

- **Conflict with Other Extensions:**  
  - If other Tealium iQ extensions or scripts modify the same payload fields (e.g. campaign parameters) or the global `u` object, there is a potential for conflict.
  
- **Static Override Logic:**  
  - The override mappings for the campaign sources are hardcoded. Changes in marketing strategies or campaign naming conventions may necessitate updates to these mappings.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks:**  
  - Although checks for the availability of `eventType` and `eventPayload` are not needed per the requirements, consider additional validations on the presence of campaign fields where possible.  
  - Ensure that the global functions (like `LBGAnalytics.Q`) and objects are adequately documented and available in the environment.

- **Code Style and Modularisation:**  
  - Refactor repetitive sections (such as the loop for PII checking) into helper functions to keep the code DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself).  
  - While maintaining ES5 compatibility, consider modularising the logic into smaller, testable functions.

- **Comments and Documentation:**  
  - Include inline comments explaining critical steps (e.g. the purpose of each eligibility expression and the reason for specific overrides).  
  - Consider adding more detailed error logging in case a key dependency, like `URLSearchParams`, is not available.

- **Legacy Browser Support:**  
  - If supporting older browsers is necessary, include a polyfill for `URLSearchParams` and consider using alternative methods for building query strings.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  - Establish ownership of this extension by assigning a responsible developer/team for periodic reviews.  
  - Set up regression tests to ensure that changes to campaign parameter formats or external dependencies (like AppsFlyer) do not break the deep linking logic.

- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Execute tests with different sets of payload data including cases with missing fields, differing campaign sources, and potential PII to ensure the sanitisation logic performs as expected.  
  - Monitor browser support issues, especially concerning newer features like `URLSearchParams`.

- **Version Control & Documentation Updates:**  
  - Maintain version control on the extension code and document any changes or bug fixes.  
  - Communicate any configuration changes (e.g. updates to the override values or eligibility expressions) with relevant stakeholders.

- **Future Enhancements:**  
  - Consider decoupling the eligibility logic from the query parameter mapping, allowing for more configurability in future iterations.  
  - Explore integrating more robust PII detection mechanisms if data privacy requirements evolve.
