# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: Pegasus V2 : META Functions

## 1. Extension Overview
- **Name**: Pegasus V2 : META functions
- **ID**: 2278
- **Type**: Advanced Javascript Code
- **Scope**: 1783
- **Execution Frequency**: On specific events and conditions based on defined triggers

### Summary
The **Pegasus V2 : META functions** extension is designed to facilitate sending conversion data to Facebook's tracking system based on user interactions and predefined conditions. It is particularly focused on capturing and processing metadata associated with user journeys, including identifiers and details about journeys and products. By streamlining this data flow to Facebook, the extension aids in accurate conversion tracking, ensuring that marketing efforts are informed by complete and relevant data.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- **b**: This is a global object that appears to carry various properties related to the marketing activity, such as product details, journey specifics, and user identifiers.
- **meta_event(ev)**: A function that constructs the payload for conversion tracking and triggers Facebook's tracking function.
- **unpackStr(TagValues, delim)**: Utilises a delimiter to convert a delimited string into an array.
- **createElig(arr)**: Converts lookup structure into eligibility rules for tag triggering.
- **setTags(ev, trigger)**: Determines whether to fire tags based on the event type and conditions.

### Logic Flow
1. **Initial Setup**: The main IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) accepts `eventType`, `eventPayload`, and `tagObject` as parameters.
2. **Payload Construction**: The `meta_event` function constructs a payload from various properties defined in object `b`.
3. **Tag Triggering**: The code determines whether to send the payload to Facebook based on event types (Page, Timed, Event).
   - For "Page" triggers, no action is taken as it's handled by existing tags.
   - For "Timed" triggers, a timeout function is set to execute after a specified delay.
   - For "Event" triggers, event listeners are attached to specific elements and actions to capture user interactions.

### Dependencies
The code references a global object `LBGAnalytics` for handling jQuery-style event binding. It assumes the existence of Facebook's tracking function (`fbq`) for event tracking.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Scenario
- **User Journey**: A user navigates through a product page and adds an item to their cart.
- **Outcome**: Upon the user completing a predefined action, the extension captures relevant details (e.g., product group, journey name) and sends a conversion event to Facebook.

### Edge Condition
- **Event Trigger**: If a user clicks on a button that doesn't exist or isn't handled in the `setTags` function.
- **Outcome**: The system will catch the error quietly (due to the try-catch structure), preventing the extension from failing completely, but the intended conversion event may not get sent.

---

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas
- **Event Binding**: If the elements being targeted for event listeners do not exist on the page when the script executes, no events will be captured, leading to missed conversion tracking.
- **Trigger Types**: The extension only works optimally with the prescribed `Page`, `Timed`, and `Event` triggers. Any deviation in expected formats may halt functionality.
- **Potential Conflicts**: There may be conflicts with other extensions that modify the `b` object or with other scripts that manipulate global variables.

---

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring
- **Error Handling**: While the code safely ignores errors via `try-catch`, logging errors to a console or external tracking destination could improve debugging.
- **Modular Design**: Consider splitting related functions into separate modules/files to enhance readability and maintainability.
- **Variable Naming**: Enhance clarity with more descriptive variable names (e.g., change `b` to something more indicative like `metadata`).
- **Performance Optimisation**: Use `Array.prototype.forEach` instead of `for...in` for array iterations to avoid potential enumerable property issues.

---

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes
- **Ownership**: Assign a core team member to manage and monitor the extension, ensuring timely updates and addressing bugs as they arise.
- **Testing Guidelines**: Conduct regular regression tests after changes to ensure existing functionality remains intact. Use automated testing where possible to streamline the process.
- **Documentation Updates**: Keep this documentation up to date with any changes made to the code, including adding new features or fixing bugs.
