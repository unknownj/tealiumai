# Pegasus V2 : META functions

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Pegasus V2 : META functions  
- **Extension ID:** 100040 (Internal id: 2278)  
- **Type:** Advanced Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** 1783  
- **Execution Frequency:**  
  - Executed on every instance where the lookup table (b.lookupTable) is processed.  
  - The code iterates through each record in the lookup table to check eligibility and set up conversion tracking triggers.

**Summary:**  
This extension is designed to process conversion tracking for meta events. It utilises data from eventPayload and additional tag objects to build a payload containing customer, product, and journey details. The payload is sent to Facebook’s conversion tracking function (fbq) using data mapping and eligibility rules derived from an external lookup table. Its purpose is to ensure the correct meta event is fired based on eligibility rules, which can be triggered immediately, on a timer or by user events.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables and Parameters

- **Function parameters:**  
  - `a` (eventType): A string representing the type of event.  
  - `b` (eventPayload): An object containing various data points (e.g. dmp_id_hashed, PegasusTagName, CanonicalURL etc.).  
  - `u` (tagObject): Object parameter (not used in current code, but available for future functions).

- **Global/Object Dependencies:**  
  - **fbq:** Assumed to be the Facebook tracking function available in the global scope.  
  - **LBGAnalytics:** A presumed global object used to attach event listeners.  
  - **b.lookupTable:** An array containing lookup table records.  
  - **b.structureLkps:** An object used for mapping lookup values in eligibility calculations.

### Logic Flow and Functionality

1. **meta_event(ev):**  
   - Purpose: To prepare and send a meta event conversion tracking call using Facebook's `fbq('track')` function.  
   - Process:
     - Build a `payld` object mapping key data properties from the eventPayload (b).  
     - Remove any properties from `payld` that are null/false.
     - Trigger the Facebook tracking event with a conversion value (1.00 GBP) and a given event id (b.paid_order_id).

2. **unpackStr(TagValues, delim):**  
   - Splits a given string (`TagValues`) with a specified delimiter and returns an array.
   - Used to extract individual values from delimited strings.

3. **createElig(arr):**  
   - Accepts an array that is expected to contain eligibility information.  
   - Uses the first value as a key to find a corresponding lookup array from `b.structureLkps`.  
   - Maps subsequent values to their respective keys and creates an array of eligibility rules (strings) using a “contains” rule.
   - Returns an array with the eligibility rules and a trigger type extracted from the input array.

4. **unpackTag(arr):**  
   - This function splits a lookup table record (provided as an array) into two parts: an input string and an output string.
   - These two strings are further processed by other functions.

5. **findTag(currentTag):**  
   - Examines a tag string by splitting on “!” and checking if the first part ('tagType') matches the expected value (‘meta’).
   - Returns the tag parameters if they match, otherwise undefined.

6. **setTags(ev, trigger):**  
   - Determines how to execute the meta event based on the trigger type:
      - **Page Trigger:** No additional action is performed, assuming the meta event may already be running.
      - **Timed Trigger:** Extracts the timeout from the trigger using unpackStr and sets a window timeout to execute `meta_event(ev)`.
      - **Event Trigger:** Attaches an event listener using LBGAnalytics to the specified element.  
         - Supports two scenarios:
           - One with just a div name and an event type.  
           - One that additionally checks for a specific button text before triggering the event.

7. **runLookups(currentArr):**  
   - Processes each record in the lookup table:
      - Unpacks the record into input and output strings.
      - Splits the input into eligibility items and separates tag item definitions.
      - Checks for meta tag registrations within the tag items.
      - Creates eligibility rules and extracts a trigger type.
      - If all eligibility rules are met (using the external function clova3.Q for evaluation), the code sets up the fbTrackType and calls `setTags` with the determined event type.

8. **Execution:**  
   - The code iterates over `b.lookupTable` and applies the `runLookups` function to each record, ensuring that each potential conversion event is evaluated.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Example 1: Standard Page Load

- **Data Flow:**
  - On a typical page load event, `eventType` and `eventPayload` are passed to the extension.
  - b.lookupTable contains relevant lookup records.  
  - Eligibility tests (using clova3.Q) all pass.
  - The tag parameters for a “meta” event are found.
  - fbq() is called immediately or after a timer delay if trigger type is “Timed”.

- **Outcome:**  
  The meta conversion event is successfully tracked via Facebook with the correct payload data.

### Example 2: Delayed (Timed) Trigger

- **Scenario:**
  - A lookup record includes a trigger formatted as “Timed:3000” indicating a 3-second delay.
  - The extension processes the lookup, meets eligibility rules, and sets a 3000ms timeout.
  - After the timeout, `meta_event()` is executed and the tracking event sent.

- **Outcome:**  
  The event is triggered with a slight delay, useful when waiting for additional data or user interactions.

### Example 3: Event-Based Trigger

- **Scenario:**
  - A lookup record contains an event trigger such as “Event:#button:click” or “Event:#button:click:Confirm”.
  - The extension finds the meta tag registration, attaches an event listener on the specified element.
  - If the event (e.g. a click) occurs—and if a button text check is specified, verifies the text—the meta event function is executed.

- **Outcome:**  
  The conversion event only fires when a specific user interaction occurs on the page.

### Edge Conditions

- **Missing or Null Data:**  
  - The code removes any null or falsey values from the payload. If critical values (e.g. external_id) are null, those keys are omitted.  
- **Pattern Mismatch:**  
  - If the lookup record does not contain the expected meta tag identifier in its delimited string, then the record is skipped.  
- **Trigger Format Errors:**  
  - If the trigger string is improperly formatted (too few or too many segments), the event listener setup may fail and errors are logged to the console.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Data Dependencies:**  
  - The extension relies on the existence and proper formatting of `b.lookupTable` and `b.structureLkps`. If these are not set or are misconfigured, eligibility checks will fail.
  
- **Global Object Reliance:**  
  - The code assumes that global objects like `fbq` and `LBGAnalytics` are available and correctly implemented.  
  - The evaluation function `clova3.Q` must be defined and correctly return boolean values; otherwise, eligibility rules may not be correctly processed.

- **Event Listener Setup:**  
  - The code uses a jQuery-like syntax (`LBGAnalytics.$`) for event listeners; conflicts may occur if multiple libraries manipulate the same selectors or if the DOM is not ready when the listeners are attached.

- **Timing and Consent Logic (Commented Out):**  
  - There is commented code related to potential future consent mode adjustments. If enabling consent checks, the deletion of identifiers might need careful review.

- **Error Logging:**  
  - Errors during event listener execution are caught and logged to the console. However, errors in eligibility functions (e.g. if clova3.Q is not available) might fail silently.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks (Within ES5 Constraints):**  
  - Even though eventType and eventPayload are guaranteed, add defensive checks for other objects (e.g. b.structureLkps, b.lookupTable) to avoid runtime errors if they are not as expected.
  
- **Modularisation:**  
  - Consider splitting the code into separate modules or functions stored in separate files. For example, separate the eligibility rule creation, tag parsing, and trigger handling into distinct files or functions.
  
- **Code Comments and Readability:**  
  - Increase inline documentation for each function so that future developers can understand the purpose of each section quickly.
  - Use consistent commenting style and spacing for better readability.
  
- **Error Handling:**  
  - Implement more robust error handling, particularly around parsing and event listener attachment. Consider logging context details for errors to aid troubleshooting.
  
- **Testing:**  
  - Develop unit tests for individual functions (e.g. unpackStr, createElig) to ensure code behaves as expected under edge conditions.
  
- **Code Style Consistency:**  
  - Stick to ES5 conventions (using var instead of let/const, function expressions instead of arrow functions) as required.  
  - Consider using a linter configured for ES5 to help enforce code style guidelines.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  - Assign an owner (or team) to regularly review and update the extension when dependencies (such as fbq or LBGAnalytics) are updated.
  - Schedule periodic testing to validate that external objects (e.g. clova3.Q) are still available and performing as expected.
  
- **Version Control:**  
  - Ensure that changes to the extension are committed to a version control system, with version tagging to track changes over time.

- **Documentation Updates:**  
  - Update this documentation whenever changes are made to the extension so that future developers can quickly understand modifications.
  
- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Always test the extension in a staging environment before deploying to production.
  - Simulate various trigger types (Page, Timed, and Event) and ensure that payloads are correctly built and the integration with fbq works.
  
- **Dependencies Audit:**  
  - Regularly audit external dependencies like LBGAnalytics and clova3 to ensure that they have proper contracts. Document any potential breaking changes.
