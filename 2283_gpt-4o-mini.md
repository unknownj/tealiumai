# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation

## 1. Extension Overview
- **Name**: (Not Specified)
- **ID**: 2283
- **Type**: Javascript Code
- **Scope**: 928
- **Execution Frequency**: On Page Load

### Summary
This Tealium iQ extension is designed to extract a specific journey name from the URL parameters and set it as a property (`JourneyName`) on the `b` object (event payload). The extension is only triggered when the visitor is on a specific path (`secure-aem-hub`). Additionally, it triggers an analytics call to `LBGAnalytics` under certain conditions to track the user interaction with the savings calculator pages, while gracefully handling scenarios where errors may occur.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- `journeyName`: Extracted from the URL search parameters and hash. It stores the journey name if present and does not include "savings-calculator".
- `b.JourneyName`: A property of the object `b`, assigned the value of `journeyName` if valid.
- `u.aemSantaLoad`: A flag in the `u` object that prevents multiple calls to the `LBGAnalytics` function during the same page load.

### Logic Flow
1. The extension checks if the current path contains `"secure-aem-hub"`.
2. If true, it constructs the `journeyName` by parsing the URL.
3. `journeyName` is validated to ensure it is a string and does not include "savings-calculator".
4. If valid, it assigns `journeyName` to `b.JourneyName`.
5. The code then checks if `u.aemSantaLoad` is not set:
   - If not, it sets `u.aemSantaLoad` to true and calls the `LBGAnalytics.santa.do()` method for analytics tracking.
6. Any errors encountered during this process are caught and ignored.

### Dependencies
- The extension relies on the global object `LBGAnalytics` for tracking user interactions.
- The execution context requires `eventType`, `eventPayload`, and `tagObject` to be provided at runtime.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Condition
- On navigating to `https://example.com/secure-aem-hub?param1=value1&aempage=myJourney`, the `journeyName` extracted would be `myJourney`. This value would then be set in the `b` object as `b.JourneyName`.

### Edge Condition
- If the URL is `https://example.com/secure-aem-hub?aempage=savings-calculator`, the condition prevents setting `b.JourneyName`, thereby not sending conflicting analytics data.

### Error Handling
- If there's an issue calling `LBGAnalytics`, the extension simply catches the error and continues executing without halting the rest of the script.

---

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas
- If the URL does not contain a valid `aempage` parameter, `b.JourneyName` will not be set, leading to possible analytics gaps.
- Should multiple scripts attempt to modify `b` simultaneously, race conditions may arise.
- The extension assumes that the `LBGAnalytics` object and method are always available; if not, it will fail silently without any indication.

---

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring
- **Defensive Checks**: Introduce checks to assess whether `b` and `u` objects are defined before attempting to set properties on them.
- **Code Style**: Use consistent indentation and spacing for readability.
- **Modularisation**: Consider splitting logic into smaller functions for clarity and maintainability. For example, extracting the logic that parses the URL into a separate function.
- **Improved Comments**: Add comments to explain the logic behind key operations and the purpose of dependencies.

---

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes
- **Ongoing Maintenance**: Ensure to review the extension whenever URL structures or analytics requirements change.
- **Ownership**: Designate a specific developer/team responsible for maintaining this extension.
- **Testing Guidelines**: Conduct thorough testing whenever changes are made, including both functional and edge case tests. Monitor the extension during peak usage times to ensure it performs as expected.
