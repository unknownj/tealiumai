# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the Tealium iQ Javascript Code extension that performs analytics tagging and dynamic assignment of journey information based on the URL parameters for the secure AEM hub.

---

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** *Not specified* (currently an empty string; consider naming appropriately)
- **Extension ID:** 2283  
- **Extension Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** 928  
- **Execution Frequency:** Executes on each page load when the extension conditions are met

**Summary:**  
This extension checks if the current webpage’s pathname contains the string "secure-aem-hub". If it does, the extension attempts to extract a journey name from the combined URL search and hash parameters by looking for a query parameter named "aempage". If the extracted journey name is present, is a string, and does not include the substring "savings-calculator" (in any case), the journey name is assigned to a property (JourneyName) on the event payload object. Additionally, the extension triggers a specific analytics call via a global LBGAnalytics object to record a "more-santa" action, ensuring this action is only executed once per page load by utilising a flag on the tag object.

---

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables and Parameters

- **a:** Represents the event type (provided by Tealium; not used explicitly within the code logic).
- **b:** Represents the event payload. The extension may add or modify properties on this object (e.g. assigning JourneyName).
- **u:** Represents the tag object provided by Tealium. This object is also used to store a flag (aemSantaLoad) to ensure the santa action is executed only once.

### Logic Flow

1. **Pathname Check:**  
   The code first checks if the current page’s pathname contains "secure-aem-hub". If not, the extension does nothing.

2. **Journey Name Extraction:**  
   - The extension concatenates the location search string and the location hash using an "&".  
   - It then performs a series of operations:
     - Replaces any "?" with "&" to standardise delimiters.
     - Splits the resulting string using "&" into an array of potential query parameters.
     - Filters the array for items that start with "aempage=".
     - Maps these filtered results to extract the value after the "=".
   - Only the first occurrence is utilised as the journey name.
   - If this journey name exists, is a valid string, and does not contain the substring "savings-calculator" (case insensitive), the journey name is assigned to b.JourneyName.

3. **Analytics Trigger (Santa Action):**  
   - The code enters a try/catch block to safely attempt an analytics call.
   - It checks if a flag (u.aemSantaLoad) has been set. If not, it:
     - Sets the flag to true to avoid duplicate calls.
     - Executes `LBGAnalytics.santa.do` with an object containing:
       - action: "more-santa"
       - key: "secure-aem-hub"  
   - Any exceptions thrown during this process are silently caught (no error logging).

### Global Dependencies

- **window.location:** Used to access URL pathname, search, and hash parameters.
- **LBGAnalytics:** A global analytics object required for triggering the santa action.
- **Array Prototype Methods:** Standard ES5 methods (split, filter, map) are used for processing the query parameters.
- The function parameters (eventType, eventPayload, tagObject) are injected from Tealium iQ during rule execution and are assumed to be always present.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Flow Example

**Scenario:**  
A user visits a URL such as:  
https://example.com/secure-aem-hub?param1=value1&aempage=customer_journey#section1

**Processing:**  
1. The pathname contains "secure-aem-hub" so the extension is activated.
2. The extension concatenates the search (`?param1=value1&aempage=customer_journey`) and hash (`#section1`) into a single string.
3. The code filters for the parameter "aempage", finds "customer_journey", and confirms that "customer_journey" does not include "savings-calculator".
4. It then assigns `b.JourneyName = "customer_journey"`.
5. The LBGAnalytics call is executed once with the configuration {action:"more-santa", key:"secure-aem-hub"}.

### Edge Case Example

**Scenario:**  
A user visits a URL that lacks an "aempage" parameter or where the "aempage" value contains "savings-calculator":  
https://example.com/secure-aem-hub?aempage=savings-calculator#promo

**Processing:**  
1. The pathname check passes.
2. Upon splitting the URL, the value "savings-calculator" is extracted from the "aempage" parameter.
3. The condition `journeyName.toLowerCase().indexOf("savings-calculator") < 0` fails and, as a result, b.JourneyName is not set.
4. The analytics call still occurs once, controlled by the flag, even though no JourneyName is assigned.

### Scenario without "secure-aem-hub"

**Scenario:**  
The user navigates to a URL that does not include "secure-aem-hub" in its pathname.

**Processing:**  
1. The initial check fails, and the extension does not execute any further logic.  
2. Neither JourneyName is assigned nor is the analytics call triggered.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Hardcoded String Checks:**  
  The extension relies on specific substrings in the URL (e.g. "secure-aem-hub" and "aempage"). If the URL structure changes, the extension may not function as intended.

- **Single Occurrence Enforcement:**  
  The extension only uses the first occurrence of the "aempage" parameter. Additional values are ignored.

- **Silent Failure for Analytics:**  
  The try/catch block around the LBGAnalytics call swallows errors. This can make debugging issues with the analytics call more challenging.

- **Global Dependencies:**  
  The extension relies on the presence of the global LBGAnalytics object. If this object is not available or is redefined elsewhere, the analytics call may fail.

- **Query Parameter Parsing:**  
  The manual splitting and filtering of query parameters might lead to potential issues if the URL format deviates from expected patterns (e.g. non-standard parameter format, additional question marks).

- **Potential Conflicts:**  
  If other Tealium extensions or scripts modify the same global objects (like LBGAnalytics or the URL search/hash handling), unexpected behaviour might result.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Extract Query Parsing Logic:**  
  Consider modularising the URL query processing logic into a separate function. This will improve code clarity and ease of testing.

- **Error Handling Enhancements:**  
  Even though silent fails might be acceptable in production, logging errors (possibly to a debug console) during development could improve troubleshooting.

- **Flag Management:**  
  The current approach to ensuring a single execution via the u.aemSantaLoad flag works, but ensure that any other extensions or asynchronous operations do not conflict with this flag.

- **Code Comments and Naming:**  
  Adding more inline comments and using descriptive variable names would improve maintainability and readability.

- **Testing Considerations:**  
  Implement unit tests covering different URL scenarios (normal, edge cases, missing parameters) to ensure the logic remains robust against changes in URL structure and input.

*Note:* All recommendations must remain within ES5 standards, hence use of functions, var declarations and traditional string manipulation is maintained.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  - Review the extension periodically to ensure it continues to align with any changes in URL structures or analytics requirements.
  - Update the extension name and description once finalised by stakeholders.

- **Ownership:**  
  - Assign a point of contact or a team responsible for maintaining and testing this extension.
  - Document changes in a version log within the code comments or your version control system.

- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Include automated tests (if possible) that mimic various URL scenarios.
  - Test the analytics call using a staging environment to verify that LBGAnalytics invokes the expected actions.
  - Perform regression testing whenever any changes are made to the global analytics object or URL processing.

- **Further Documentation:**  
  - Maintain this documentation alongside any other Tealium extensions to ensure all stakeholders are aware of the functionality, dependencies, and potential edge cases.
  - Encourage code reviews and discussions using this documentation as a reference point for any enhancements.
