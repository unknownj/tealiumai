# Meta Account Lookup Extension Documentation

This document details the "Meta account lookup" extension used in Tealium iQ. It covers an overview of the extension, a detailed explanation of the code, usage examples, known limitations and gotchas, recommendations for refactoring, and maintenance notes.

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Meta account lookup  
- **Extension ID:** 100036 (system-assigned), Internal ID: 2284  
- **Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** 1783  
- **Execution Frequency:** Executed on every tag-trigger event (invoked per event payload)

**Summary:**  
The extension is designed to perform a conversion lookup by using a master table of lookup values. It processes incoming event data, sets lower case values for brand and canonical path in the LBGAnalytics datalayer if available, and then checks through a list of conversion rules. When the eligibility conditions (based on mapping and lookup criteria) are met, the extension updates the tag object by setting a conversion identifier (fbID). The extension is used to determine when a conversion should be tracked and to supply the conversion ID to the downstream conversion tracking system.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Global Dependencies & Initial Setup

- **Global Objects:**  
  - `window.LBGAnalytics`: The extension first verifies that a global object named LBGAnalytics (with a datalayer) is present.  
  - `eventType`, `eventPayload`, and `tagObject`: Passed into the IIFE as arguments.
  
- **Datapoint Setting:**  
  - If `LBGAnalytics.datalayer` is available, it sets two properties:
    - `PegasusBrand_lc` – lowercase version of `eventPayload.PegasusBrand`
    - `CanonicalPath_lc` – lowercase version of `eventPayload.CanonicalPath`

### Core Variables and Data Structures

- **structureLkpsM:**  
  An object that maps lookup type keys (e.g. "_1", "_2") to arrays of string identifiers. These identifiers define which conditions must be met in the lookup rule.

- **lkptbl:**  
  A master lookup table (an array of arrays) where each inner array represents a lookup record. Each record comprises:
  - A key string that encodes lookup type, event type and brand (and possibly additional criteria) separated by the "!" delimiter.
  - A conversion ID (fbID).

### Key Functions

- **unpackStr(MValues, delim):**  
  - **Purpose:** Splits a delimited string into an array of substrings.
  - **Return:** An array of split elements.

- **createElig(arr):**  
  - **Purpose:**  
    1. Receives an array that was produced from splitting the input lookup key string.  
    2. Uses the first element (e.g. "_1" or "_2") to retrieve the corresponding detail criteria from `structureLkpsM`.  
    3. Maps each criterion to the corresponding value from the array.  
    4. Constructs an eligibility array of strings in the format "criteria contains value".
  - **Return:** An array (within an array structure) containing the rules which will be evaluated later using a global method (e.g. `LBGAnalytics.Q`).

- **unpackM(arr):**  
  - **Purpose:** Splits the current lookup record into two parts:
    - The input string containing the lookup key values.
    - The output string containing tag parameters (currently, fbID in the format of a delimited string).
  - **Return:** An array holding the input and output strings.

- **setTags(fbID):**  
  - **Purpose:** Sets the tag object's `fbID` property if a valid conversion ID is found.
  - **Dependency:** Relies on the passed-in `tagObject` (through argument `b` in the IIFE).

- **runLookups(currentArr):**  
  - **Logic Flow:**  
    1. Extracts the lookup key (input) and the conversion parameters (output) from the current lookup record.
    2. Splits the input string into components using the `unpackStr` function.
    3. Creates the eligibility rules array using `createElig`.
    4. Evaluates all the eligibility rule strings using a global function (assumed to be `LBGAnalytics.Q`) to determine if all conditions are met.
    5. If the eligibility test passes, it retrieves the conversion id (fbID) from the output string after splitting and then calls `setTags`.
    6. Returns `false` to exit the loop early using the Array.every method, otherwise continues.
    
  - **Note:** The method uses early exit of the lookup array if a match is found.

### Execution Flow

1. The IIFE receives `eventType`, `eventPayload` and `tagObject` (assigned internally as `a, b, u` respectively).
2. The code checks and sets lower case values for certain datalayer properties.
3. It then iterates over the master lookup table `lkptbl`, processing each record with `runLookups`:
   - If a lookup record’s conditions are met (using `LBGAnalytics.Q`), the conversion code (fbID) gets set on `tagObject`.
   - If no match is found throughout all records, the default behaviour is to leave the conversion ID unchanged.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Example 1: Normal Data Flow
- **Scenario:**  
  An event comes in with an `eventPayload` containing:
  - PegasusBrand = "Lloyds"
  - CanonicalPath = "INTERNATIONAL"
  
- **Processing:**  
  1. The extension converts these values into lower-case and sets them into the `LBGAnalytics.datalayer`.
  2. The lookup key string is unpacked and compared against the terms defined in `structureLkpsM` (e.g. "_1" or "_2").
  3. If an eligibility rule such as `"CanonicalPath_lc contains international"` is validated by `LBGAnalytics.Q`, then the output string is unpacked and the fbID is retrieved.
  4. The tag object (`tagObject`) is updated with the fbID.

### Example 2: Edge Condition (No Matching Lookup)
- **Scenario:**  
  If the event payload does not generate a valid lookup key that satisfies any record in `lkptbl`:
  
- **Processing:**  
  1. The eligibility array created for each record fails the `LBGAnalytics.Q` test.
  2. No fbID is set into the tag object.
  3. The extension exits after processing all lookup records without modification.

### Example 3: Missing Global Dependency
- **Scenario:**  
  If `window.LBGAnalytics` or its `datalayer` property is not defined:
  
- **Processing:**  
  1. The initial conditional check skips the assignment of lower-case values.
  2. The remainder of the lookup processes still execute; however, if `LBGAnalytics.Q` is also embedded within that global object, then the eligibility rules might not be properly evaluated, potentially causing the conversion tag not to set fbID.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Global Dependency Reliance:**  
  The extension heavily depends on the existence and structure of `window.LBGAnalytics` (and its methods like `Q` and property `datalayer`). If these are modified or removed by other scripts, functionality may fail.

- **Delimiter Sensitivity:**  
  The code uses a "!" delimiter for splitting strings. Any unexpected or extra occurrences of this delimiter in the event payload data may corrupt the intended arrays.

- **Short-circuit Evaluation:**  
  The use of `Array.every` in the lookup processing stops iteration when a match is found (returning `false`). This means that only the first successful lookup in the list is applied.  
  • This is by design but may require special handling if multiple conversions should be tracked.

- **ES5 Constraints:**  
  Although the code is written in ES5, there is one usage of an arrow function in a `forEach` loop. In an ES5-supported environment, this might need to be refactored to a standard function expression, ensuring wider compatibility.

- **Potential Conflicts:**  
  If other Tealium extensions modify the same global objects (especially `LBGAnalytics`), it could lead to unexpected behaviour. Ensure that load order and variable names do not clash.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks:**  
  • Although eventType is guaranteed, consider adding checks for the existence of methods such as `LBGAnalytics.Q` before their use.  
  • Validate that the output from string splits (via unpackStr) has the expected number of components before mapping in `createElig`.

- **Code Style & Modularity:**  
  • Modularise functionality further by grouping helper functions into a namespace/object to avoid polluting the global scope.  
  • Replace the arrow function in the `forEach` with a standard ES5 function:
  
    Old syntax:  
    (dl) => { eligArr.push(dl + " contains " + obj[dl]); }
    
    Refactored ES5 syntax:  
    function(dl) { eligArr.push(dl + " contains " + obj[dl]); }
  
- **Comments & Documentation:**  
  • Increase inline code comments to describe each step.  
  • Consider adding unit tests to validate the correct processing of lookup rules and tag assignments.

- **Performance Considerations:**  
  • If the master lookup table grows significantly, consider optimising the lookup algorithm (such as using a more direct mapping structure) for faster searches.

- **Maintain ES5 Compatibility:**  
  • Remain cautious not to use any ES6+ features to ensure backward compatibility across all supported browsers/environments.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  • Ensure the master lookup table (`lkptbl`) and the mapping structure (`structureLkpsM`) are updated in sync with any changes in business logic or conversion criteria.  
  • Schedule periodic code reviews to verify the continued compatibility with updates to global dependencies (e.g. LBGAnalytics).

- **Ownership & Version Control:**  
  • Document changes in a version-controlled environment and assign clear ownership for future updates.  
  • Consider integrating with automated testing to validate assumptions (for example, the structure of datalayer and google ads parameters).

- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  • Test with a variety of event payload configurations to ensure robust handling of both typical and edge-case inputs.  
  • Validate that the early termination in the lookup process behaves correctly and that no duplicate or partial updates occur to the tagObject.

- **Documentation Updates:**  
  • Update this documentation whenever the lookup logic, global dependencies, or tag output parameters change.
