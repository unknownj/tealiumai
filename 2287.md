# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: AEM Hub Events POC

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name**: AEM Hub Events POC
- **ID**: 2287
- **Type**: Javascript Code
- **Scope**: DOM Ready
- **Execution Frequency**: Run Once

### Summary
This extension is designed to track external link clicks on a specific path within the URL, namely `/secure-aem-hub/`. It listens for click events on anchor elements that begin with the `nga` prefix. Once detected, it sends an analytics event indicating that an external link has been clicked, along with the relevant details of the link.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- `window.location.pathname`: This global object retrieves the path component of the current URL, allowing the extension to determine if the current page is within the desired path.
- `Array.from(document.querySelectorAll("a[href^=nga]"))`: This line collects all anchor (`<a>`) elements on the page where the `href` attribute starts with `nga`.

### Logic Flow
1. The code first checks if the current path includes `/secure-aem-hub/`.
2. If conditions are satisfied, a `setTimeout` function is initiated to ensure the DOM is fully loaded before executing the next block.
3. Within the `setTimeout`, a selection of anchor elements with the specified `href` prefix is made.
4. For each anchor element, a click event listener is added.
5. When an anchor is clicked, it extracts the `href` attribute and text content to construct an analytics event, which is sent via `LBGAnalytics.events.send()`.

### Dependencies
- This extension relies on the global `document` object for DOM manipulation and `window` object for accessing the current URL.
- Additionally, it assumes that the `LBGAnalytics` object is globally available for sending analytics events.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Sample Scenario
1. **Normal Condition**: 
   - User navigates to a page under `/secure-aem-hub/` and clicks on an external link that starts with `nga`.
   - The extension registers the click, extracts the relevant information, and sends an event to the analytics platform with details like "External Click" and the link's text.

2. **Edge Condition (No Matching Links)**: 
   - User navigates to `/secure-aem-hub/` but there are no applicable anchor elements with `href` starting with `nga`.
   - The extension runs without sending any events as there are no registered click listeners.

### Expected Behavior
- The extension consistently registers click events for all matching anchors fully loaded in the DOM.
- If the URL does not match or contains no `nga`-prefixed links, no events are sent.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Delay in Listener Attachment**: The `setTimeout` of 3000ms may lead to delayed event registration. If users click links before this period elapses, those clicks will not be captured.
- **Dynamic Content**: If new anchor elements are added to the DOM after the initial load (e.g., via AJAX), those will not have the event listeners attached, potentially resulting in incomplete data tracking.
- **Compatibility Issues**: Ensure that other extensions or scripts do not overwrite or interfere with the `LBGAnalytics` or DOM manipulation functions.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Error Handling**: Consider logging errors instead of silently failing. This will assist in diagnosing scenarios where event sending fails.
- **Event Delegation**: Instead of attaching multiple listeners to each anchor, consider a single event listener on a common ancestor (event delegation) to reduce the number of event listeners and improve performance.
- **Timeout Configuration**: The timeout duration (3000ms) could potentially be made configurable through a variable, allowing easy modifications without diving into the code.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ownership**: Assign at least one developer to oversee this extension, ensuring they are familiar with both the code and its intended functionality.
- **Testing Guidelines**: Implement thorough testing on all scenarios, including boundary cases (no eligible links and rapid clicking). Continuous integration (CI) could be beneficial to automate tests.
- **Documentation Updates**: As changes are made to the extension, update this documentation accordingly, especially when adding new features or significantly altering the existing behaviour.
