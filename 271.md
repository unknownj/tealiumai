# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: Anti Phishing Script

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name**: Anti Phishing Script
- **ID**: 271
- **Type**: Javascript Code
- **Scope**: Pre Loader
- **Execution Frequency**: Run Once

### Summary
The Anti Phishing Script is a Tealium iQ extension designed to detect and mitigate phishing attempts on a website. By examining the incoming documentâ€™s structure and content, this script helps ensure user safety by blocking access to known malicious sites. The execution is performed once, and the script incorporates a mechanism to run after a delay, allowing other scripts to load and ensuring compatibility with various page configurations.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- **`i`**: A list of encoded strings representing various malicious domains.
- **`G`**: An array utilized to store additional domain patterns for verification.
- **`a`**: A reference to the `atob` function for decoding base64 encoded strings.
- **`m`, `u`**: Global document object references for specific page elements.
- **`v()`**: A function that retrieves and decodes the provided base64 string.

### Logic Flow
1. **Delay Execution**: The main function is wrapped inside a `setTimeout()` to ensure it executes after a 3-second delay.
2. **Error Handling**: A `try-catch` block is used to avoid breaking execution in case of an error.
3. **Domain Verification**:
   - The function loops through the `i` array (malicious domains) and checks if the current document domain matches any of them.
   - If a match is found, appropriate actions are taken to prevent further access.
4. **Fallback Verification**: A second loop verifies against a different set of domain patterns stored in `G`.

### Dependencies on Global Objects or Libraries
- The script relies on the global `window` object and methods such as `document`, `atob`, and various JavaScript functions to manipulate strings and access DOM elements. It assumes the environment supports these global references.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Flow
- When a user visits the website, the Anti Phishing Script initiates after 3 seconds, checking for the presence of known malicious domains.
- If the user's URL is not in the malicious list, they can interact with the website normally.

### Edge Conditions
- If a user is attempting to access a legitimate domain that is similarly encoded, the script may inadvertently block access, resulting in a negative user experience. 
- Network latency can affect the timing of the execution and, thereby, the effectiveness of the checks.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **False Positives**: The encoding method may lead to legitimate domains being flagged as malicious if they share similar encoded characteristics as those in the malicious list.
- **Hardcoded Values**: The list of domains is hardcoded and requires regular updates to stay relevant. Manual updates are needed to ensure its effectiveness against new threats.
- **Delayed Execution**: The 3-second timeout introduces a risk where a user might have loaded malicious content before the check runs.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Centralise Domain Management**: Consider externalising the list of malicious domains to facilitate easier updates and management.
- **Defensive Checks**: Implement additional checks to validate the execution context and ensure that the `atob` method is available.
- **Improve Readability**: Refactor the code to enhance clarity by using meaningful variable names and breaking down complex logic into smaller, reusable functions.
- **Code Comments**: Adding detailed comments throughout the code would aid understanding and future modifications.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ownership & Responsibility**: Assign a developer to own the Anti Phishing Script to ensure its updates and effectiveness over time.
- **Testing Guidelines**: Develop a test strategy that includes verifying functionality across various devices and browsers to ensure consistent behaviour. 
- **Scheduled Review**: Implement a quarterly review process to evaluate the performance of the Anti Phishing Script and its list of domains against new phishing threats.

By adhering to the outlined documentation, developers and stakeholders can ensure that the Anti Phishing Script remains effective and is properly maintained over time.
