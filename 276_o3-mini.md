# Q - A Load Rule Processor

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** Q - A Load Rule Processor  
- **Extension ID:** 100036 (Internal ID: 276)  
- **Type:** Javascript Code  
- **Scope:** Pre Loader  
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Once  

**Summary:**  
This extension creates or assigns a load rule processor (referred to as Q) that evaluates various types of rules (booleans, functions, arrays, objects, and strings) to determine whether certain conditions are met. It acts as a central processor to decide if a load rule passes, supporting natural language processing for string-based rules and leveraging window data (and a custom data layer if provided) for comparisons. The processor will try to re-use an existing Q processor from window.LBGAnalytics if available; otherwise, it initialises a new one on window.clova3.

---

## 2. Code Explanation

### Global Checks & Initialisation  
- **Global Availability:**  
  The code first checks whether a Q processor already exists in `window.LBGAnalytics.Q`.  
  - If it exists, it assigns it to `window.clova3.Q` to ensure consistency.
  - If it does not exist, the code enters a try-catch block and creates a new processor using the `giveMeQ` function.

### The giveMeQ Function  
- **Purpose:**  
  The `giveMeQ` function returns a function (Q) that is responsible for processing load rules. This function is enriched with several helper methods and configuration options available via the inner object `fn`.

- **Key Components and Variables:**
  - **fn.version:**  
    Provides a version number ("1.0.0") for the processor.
    
  - **Logging Functions (`enableLogging` and `log`):**  
    Methods to enable or disable verbose logging. Logging statements throughout the code help trace the behaviour during rule processing.
  
  - **resolveFunction:**  
    A recursive helper designed to evaluate functions that may return another function. It stops after three iterations to prevent potential infinite recursion.
  
  - **Data Source (dataObject):**  
    Initially set to the global `window` object. A setter, `setDataObject`, allows the assignment of a custom data source (for instance, a data layer provided on `window.clova3.datalayer.get()`).

  - **Process Functions:**  
    - **processBoolean:** Forces any input into a Boolean value.
    - **processFunction:** Evaluates loadrules if they are functions by passing the output to the main rule processing function.
    - **processArray:** Iterates through an array of rules until one returns true.
    - **processObject:** Compares key/value pairs of an object rule against the data object.
    - **processString:** Handles string rules:
      - Rules beginning with "/" are processed as path comparisons.
      - Strings containing "/" and a period (`.`) are evaluated as full URL comparisons.
      - Plain strings that include a period (but no "/") are interpreted as domain comparisons.
      - If the string contains whitespace, it will attempt to process them as natural language strings (e.g. "key exists", "key is defined", etc.) via the `nlpStringProcessor`.
      - Custom string processing is also supported via a user-defined function set by `setStringProcessor`.
  
  - **nlpStringProcessor:**  
    Processes a natural language phrase by splitting the input into tokens (key, operator, value) and evaluates comparisons (exists, is/is not, equals, contains, starts/begins, ends).

  - **URL and Domain Helpers:**  
    - **setPath / setURL / setDomain:**  
      Methods to assign custom functions or values for comparing paths, full URLs, or domain names.
  
  - **Main Processor (`processRule`):**  
    Determines the type of the load rule (boolean, function, array, object, or string) and routes the input to the correct helper process method.
    - In case of exceptions during evaluation, it defaults to returning `false`.

- **Return Value:**  
  The Q function returned by `giveMeQ` behaves as the main entry point to process load rules. Additional helper methods are attached as properties (e.g., enableLogging, setDataObject, setPath, etc.) and are accessible via `window.clova3.Q`.

### Dependencies on Global Objects  
- **window:**  
  Used as the default data object for comparisons and for obtaining the current `location` (path, hostname).
  
- **window.LBGAnalytics:**  
  If present, its Q processor takes precedence.
  
- **window.clova3:**  
  The Q processor is attached to this object. Also, the data layer is expected on `window.clova3.datalayer.get()` when the `setDataObject` method is used.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Example 1: Boolean Rule  
Suppose a load rule is passed as a boolean value:
- Input: `true`  
- Process: The rule passes directly through `processBoolean` converting the value to a Boolean.  
- Output: Returns `true`.

### Example 2: Function Rule  
If a load rule is provided as a function:
- Input: A function `function(){ return window.clova3.someValue; }`  
- Process:  
  1. The function is executed.
  2. If it returns another function, `resolveFunction` recursively evaluates it.
  3. The final outcome is processed as a load rule.
- Output: Based on the returned value of the function, processed consistently using available helper methods.

### Example 3: Array of Rules  
A load rule provided as an array (e.g., `[rule1, rule2, rule3]`):
- Process:  
  The `processArray` method will log the array length and iterate over the elements.  
  If any one of those rules returns `true` after being processed, the overall rule passes.
- Output: Boolean (`true` if at least one rule evaluates to true).

### Example 4: String as a Natural Language Rule  
A string rule like `"userStatus exists"`:
- Process:  
  The string contains a space so it might be processed using the NLP logic in `nlpStringProcessor`.
  - It will split into tokens (e.g., key "userStatus" and operator "exists").
  - It then checks whether `window` (or a custom data object) has a property named `userStatus`.
- Output: Returns `true` if `userStatus` is defined, otherwise `false`.

### Edge Conditions  
- If a string-based rule does not match any of the string processing criteria (e.g. ambiguous or misspelt operator), the rule may return `false`.
- If the data object does not contain the keys referenced in an object or natural language rule, the processing function will log a message and return `false`.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Error Suppression:**  
  The `try...catch` block in the initialisation silently swallows errors. This behaviour may hide underlying issues during rule evaluation, making debugging harder.

- **Recursive Function Evaluation:**  
  The `resolveFunction` helper stops after 3 iterations. Complex rules that require deeper recursion may not be fully resolved.

- **Data Dependency:**  
  The processor relies heavily on global objects such as `window`, `window.clova3.datalayer`, and `window.location`. If these are not set up as expected, the rule processing might misbehave.

- **String Evaluation Ambiguities:**  
  Rules provided as strings are parsed in multiple ways (as a path, URL, domain, or NLP-based command). In certain edge cases, a rule might be misinterpreted if the string does not clearly adhere to one expected format.

- **Potential Conflicts:**  
  If multiple Tealium iQ extensions attempt to modify or use `window.clova3` or `window.LBGAnalytics`, there may be conflicts. Coordination with other scripts is recommended.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks and Error Reporting:**  
  Although errors regarding `eventType` and `eventPayload` are out of scope, consider adding more detailed error logging within catch blocks to flag unexpected behaviour during rule processing.

- **Modularisation:**  
  Break the large function (`giveMeQ`) into smaller modules or helper scripts. This will simplify testing and allow for targeted unit tests of the various processing functions (e.g., `processString`, `processObject`, `nlpStringProcessor`).

- **Method Organisation:**  
  Group helper methods (for logging, rule evaluation, and configuration) into well-named objects or use comment sections to improve readability and maintainability.

- **Documentation Comments:**  
  Add inline comments and JSDoc style comments for each function. These comments will be helpful when maintaining the code over time, especially given that we are supporting ES5.

- **Code Style Consistency:**  
  Follow a consistent coding style. Although ES2015 features are off the table, using consistent indentation, spacing and naming conventions in ES5 will enhance clarity.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Version Tracking:**  
  Maintain version information (as seen in `fn.version`) with every significant update. This allows for easy troubleshooting if behaviour changes between versions.

- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Implement unit tests for each processing function.  
  - Test rules with various data types (booleans, functions, arrays, objects, strings) to ensure all logic paths are correctly evaluated.  
  - Validate the extension by simulating changes in the `window.location` and the custom data object.

- **Ownership and Code Reviews:**  
  Designate an owner for this extension who will be responsible for periodic reviews, especially to check compatibility with other Tealium extensions or changes in the global environment.

- **Future Enhancements:**  
  Review usage patterns over time to find opportunities for further refactoring. Consider logging improvements, more robust error handling, or additional rule processing features if required by future use cases.

- **Documentation Updates:**  
  Keep this document up-to-date with any changes to the extension. Versioning within the code should be mirrored by corresponding updates in the documentation for clarity.
