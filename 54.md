# Tealium iQ Extension Documentation: LBG : ALR: Set : Consolidated Impressions

## 1. Extension Overview
- **Name**: LBG : ALR: Set : Consolidated Impressions
- **ID**: 100036
- **Type**: JavaScript Code
- **Scope**: After Load Rules
- **Execution Frequency**: Run Always

### Summary
The `LBG : ALR: Set : Consolidated Impressions` extension is designed to consolidate impression data from various payload variables into a single variable called `ConsolidatedImpressions`. This extension compiles impression data into a semi-colon delimited string format for easier handling and transmission. This is particularly useful in environments where multiple sources of impression data exist and a unified string is required for analytics or tracking purposes.

---

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables
- **temporaryImpressionList**: An object used to store unique impressions temporarily.
- **b.ConsolidatedImpressions**: A string variable to hold the final concatenated string of impressions extracted from the payload.
- **k**: A variable used as a key in iteration over the properties of the payload object.

### Logic Flow
1. **Initialisation**: The function starts by defining a temporary object (`temporaryImpressionList`) to store unique impressions and initialises `ConsolidatedImpressions` as an empty string.
  
2. **Impression Extraction**:
   - The code iterates over the properties in the `eventPayload` object (`b`). 
   - For each property, it checks if the key (case-insensitive) contains the word "impression".
   - If an impression is found, it splits the associated value by semi-colons (`;`) to handle multiple impressions.
   - Each unique impression is added to the `temporaryImpressionList`.

3. **String Construction**:
   - After extracting all unique impressions, a second iteration constructs the `ConsolidatedImpressions` string by appending keys from `temporaryImpressionList`, separated by semi-colons.

### Dependencies
This extension relies on the following global objects:
- `eventType`: A string that triggers the extension.
- `eventPayload`: An object containing the payload data with potential keys including various impressions.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Condition
Assuming the `eventPayload` contains the following data:
```javascript
{
    "impressionData1": "impressionA;impressionB",
    "impressionData2": "impressionC;impressionB"
}
```
Upon execution, `ConsolidatedImpressions` will be:
```
"impressionA;impressionB;impressionC;"
```
This string can then be used in analytics tracking or data layer integration.

### Edge Condition
If the `eventPayload` contains no keys associated with impressions:
```javascript
{
    "otherData": "value"
}
```
In this case, `ConsolidatedImpressions` will remain an empty string:
```
""
```
This behaviour is expected and does not result in any errors; instead, it indicates no impression data was found.

---

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas
- **Impression Formatting**: If the data associated with the impression keys does not follow the expected format (e.g., improperly delimited), it may lead to unexpected results.
- **Empty Entries**: The extension appends a trailing semi-colon even if no impressions are found, which may require trimming before further processing in some contexts.
- **Naming Confusion**: If other extensions or scripts also modify `ConsolidatedImpressions`, it could lead to conflicts and unpredictable behaviour.

---

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring
- **Defensive Checks**: Consider adding validation to check the format of the impression data to ensure robustness.
- **Code Style**: Use consistent variable naming conventions for better readability; consider more descriptive names where applicable.
- **Modularisation**: Breaking down the logic into smaller functions could enhance maintainability, especially if more processing logic may be added in the future.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes
- **Ownership**: Designate a team member to oversee the maintenance of this extension. Regular reviews and updates should be planned.
- **Testing Guidelines**: Implement unit tests particularly for different payload scenarios to ensure reliability as new data formats are introduced. Manual testing should also cover various potential edge cases.
- **Documentation Updates**: Keep this documentation updated as changes are made to the code to ensure it reflects the current state of the extension accurately.
