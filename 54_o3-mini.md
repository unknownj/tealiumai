# LBG : ALR: Set : Consolidated Impressions Extension Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive overview, code explanation, usage examples, known limitations, recommendations for refactoring, and maintenance notes for the "LBG : ALR: Set : Consolidated Impressions" Tealium iQ extension.

## 1. Extension Overview

- **Name:** LBG : ALR: Set : Consolidated Impressions
- **ID:** 54 (Extension instance) | ExtensionId: 100036
- **Type:** Javascript Code
- **Scope:** After Load Rules
- **Execution Frequency:** Run Always

**Summary:**  
This extension consolidates impression data from payload variables to create a single, semi-colon delimited string stored within the `ConsolidatedImpressions` payload variable. It achieves this by scanning through all keys in the provided payload object (eventPayload) and identifies those keys that contain the substring "impression" (case insensitive). Impression values are split by semi-colons to remove any duplications, and unique impressions are collected together into one final string. This mechanism is useful for unifying multiple impression data sources into a standard format that downstream processes can easily consume.

## 2. Code Explanation

### Key Variables

- **temporaryImpressionList:**  
  An object used as a hash map to collect unique impression tokens. Its keys represent individual impressions, while the value is a boolean (`true`) simply to mark their existence.

- **ConsolidatedImpressions:**  
  A new variable added to the event payload. It will hold the final semi-colon delimited string of unique impressions.

- **k:**  
  A loop iterator used to traverse keys within the event payload (eventPayload) and later the keys from the temporary impression list.

### Logic Flow

1. **Initialisation:**  
   - The extension creates an empty object `temporaryImpressionList` to serve as a container for impressions.
   - It initialises `ConsolidatedImpressions` as an empty string in the event payload object (b).

2. **Iteration Over Payload Variables:**  
   - The code iterates through each key in the event payload (`b`).  
   - For each key, it converts the key to lowercase to perform a case-insensitive check for the substring "impression".  
   - If found, it splits the value (presumed to be a semi-colon delimited string) into an array of individual impressions.

3. **Aggregation of Unique Impressions:**  
   - Each impression from the split array is added to `temporaryImpressionList` as a key with a value of `true`, ensuring duplicate impressions are not stored.

4. **Constructing the Final String:**  
   - The extension iterates over `temporaryImpressionList`.  
   - For each non-empty impression string, it appends the impression and a trailing semi-colon to `ConsolidatedImpressions` on the payload (`b`).

### Dependencies on Global Objects

- **eventType:**  
  Passed as the first parameter (`a`), though it is not directly used within the extension code.

- **eventPayload:**  
  Passed as the second parameter (`b`), essential for this extension's functionality as it is the source and destination for the impression data.

No additional libraries or external scripts are required.

## 3. Usage Examples

### Normal Scenario

**Input Payload:**  
Assume the eventPayload contains the following keys:
- impression1: "ad1;ad2;ad3"
- impression2: "ad2;ad4"

**Processing:**
- The loop will identify both keys because they contain "impression".
- The string "ad1;ad2;ad3" is split into [ "ad1", "ad2", "ad3" ].
- The string "ad2;ad4" is split into [ "ad2", "ad4" ].
- `temporaryImpressionList` accumulates:  
  { "ad1": true, "ad2": true, "ad3": true, "ad4": true }
- Finally, `ConsolidatedImpressions` will be set to:  
  "ad1;ad2;ad3;ad4;" (Order depends on the iteration over the object)

**Output Payload:**  
eventPayload now includes a key `ConsolidatedImpressions` with the consolidated impression string.

### Edge Conditions

#### Empty or Missing Impression Data
- If no payload key contains "impression", the extension will leave `ConsolidatedImpressions` as an empty string.
- If some impression keys have empty strings or extra semi-colons (e.g., ";;"), the check `if(k !== "")` ensures that empty tokens are excluded from the final string.

#### Duplicate Handling
- Duplicate impression values across payload keys are filtered out since the code uses an object (`temporaryImpressionList`) to store unique tokens.

## 4. Known Limitations & Gotchas

- **Order of Impressions:**  
  The iteration order over object properties in JavaScript is not guaranteed. This means the order of impressions in `ConsolidatedImpressions` may vary between executions.

- **Assumption on Data Format:**  
  The code assumes that each impression payload value is a semi-colon delimited string. If the format differs, the split operation may not work as intended.

- **Case Sensitivity:**  
  Only keys containing the substring "impression" (in any case variation) are processed; similar keys that may be mislabelled or mistyped will be ignored.

- **Potential Conflicts:**  
  If other extensions attempt to manipulate the same `ConsolidatedImpressions` variable, conflicts or overwritten data could occur. Coordination is needed when multiple scripts share payload variables.

## 5. Recommendations for Refactoring

- **Defensive Checks:**  
  Although the availability of `eventType` and `eventPayload` is guaranteed, consider adding checks for the structure or data type of the impression values to avoid runtime errors in unexpected situations.

- **Code Modularity:**  
  Encapsulate the logic into a function that can be unit tested separately. For example, create a helper function that takes an impression string, returns an array of tokens, and deduplicates them.

- **Commenting and Naming Conventions:**  
  Include inline comments within loops and conditionals to improve clarity. Use more descriptive variable names where applicable, e.g.:
  - Rename "k" to "key" for readability.
  - Rename "b" to "payload" to clarify its purpose.

- **Iteration Optimisation:**  
  Although ES5 support is required, consider using standard `for...in` loops carefully and use `hasOwnProperty` checks if there is any possibility of prototype chain interference.

## 6. Maintenance & Further Notes

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**  
  - Regularly review and update the code as payload data formats evolve.  
  - Ensure that all team members understand the dependency on the specific payload structure of impression data.

- **Ownership:**  
  - Clearly define the owner or team responsible for this extension.  
  - Maintain a change log within the documentation for future revisions.

- **Testing Guidelines:**  
  - Unit tests should cover scenarios with multiple impression keys, empty values, unexpected formats, and duplicate values.
  - Integration tests should validate that the consolidated string is correctly populated in the event payload.
  - Document test cases against both standard and edge conditions to ensure consistent behaviour.

- **Documentation Updates:**  
  - Keep this documentation updated in tandem with any code modifications.  
  - Use version control (e.g. Git) to track changes and support peer reviews for future refactoring efforts.
